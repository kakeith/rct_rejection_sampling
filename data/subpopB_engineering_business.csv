"Design and Prototyping a New Add-on Module to Increase Traction Force of a Wheeled Sewer Inspection Robot
Wheeled mobile robots have been a common apparatus of interior pipe inspection for many years. One of the major drawbacks of these systems is low traction force when traversing in special conditions, such as inclined pipes. Unanticipated area and obstacles along the robot path are the major challenges of the robot in the mission success. In this paper a novel add-on module is developed to increase the robot traction when encounters obstacles, paddle and large deposit, or when move in highly inclination pipes. The developed mechanism consists of two links mounted beside the robot and causes that to pass obstacles in the path. The links' angular position or the length may be changed using an actuator. A locking mechanism, may provide switching between the two active modes in the robot. The analysis and simulation results show the capability of the developed mechanism in increasing the robot traction force. Further, using the manufactured prototype, the functionality of the developed device as a separate add-on module was verified.",0,1,1
"Analytical Inverse Kinematics for a 5-DoF Robotic Arm with a Prismatic Joint
We present an analytical solution for the inverse kinematics (IK) of a robotic arm with one prismatic joint and four revolute joints. This 5-DoF design is a result of minimizing weight while preserving functionality of the device in a wearable usage context. Generally, the IK problem for a 5-DoF robot does not guarantee solutions due to the system being over-constrained. We obtain an analytical solution by applying geometric projections and limiting the ranges of motion for each DoF. We validate this solution by reconstructing randomly sampled end-effector poses, and find position errors below 2 cm and orientation errors below 4 degrees.",0,0,1
"A Novel Quantum-Dot Cellular Automata X-bit × 32-bit SRAM
Application of quantum-dot cellular automata (QCA) technology as an alternative to CMOS technology on the nanoscale has a promising future; QCA is an interesting technology for building memory. The proposed design and simulation of a new memory cell structure based on QCA with a minimum delay, area, and complexity is presented to implement a static random access memory (SRAM). This paper presents the design and simulation of a 16-bit $\times 32$ -bit SRAM with a new structure in QCA. Since QCA is a pipeline, this SRAM has a high operating speed. The 16-bit $\times 32$ -bit SRAM has a new structure with a 32-bit width designed and implemented in QCA. It has the ability of a conventional logic SRAM that can provide read/write operations frequently with minimum delay. The 16-bit $\times 32$ -bit SRAM is generalized and an $n\times 16$ -bit $\times 32$ -bit SRAM is implemented in QCA. Novel 16-bit decoders and multiplexers (MUXs) in QCA are presented that have been designed with a minimum number of majority gates and cells. The new SRAM, decoders, and MUXs are designed, implemented, and simulated in QCA using a signal distribution network to avoid the coplanar problem of crossing wires. The QCA-based SRAM cell was compared with the SRAM cell based on CMOS. Results show that the proposed SRAM is more efficient in terms of area, complexity, clock frequency, latency, throughput, and power consumption.",0,0,0

"How diverse is the ACII community? Analysing gender, geographical and business diversity of Affective Computing research
ACII is the premier international forum for presenting the latest research on affective computing. In this work, we monitor, quantify and reflect on the diversity in ACII conference across time by computing a set of indexes. We measure diversity in terms of gender, geographic location and academia vs research centres vs industry, and consider three different actors: authors, keynote speakers and organizers. Results raise awareness on the limited diversity in the field, in all studied facets, and compared to other AI conferences. While gender diversity is relatively high, equality is far from being reached. The community is dominated by European, Asian and North American researchers, leading the rest of continents under-represented. There is also a strong absence of companies and research centres focusing on applied research and products. This study fosters discussion in the community on the need for diversity and related challenges in terms of minimizing potential biases of the developed systems to the represented groups. We intend our paper to contribute with a first analysis to consider as a monitoring tool when implementing diversity initiatives.

"Agile project management and public policy development projects: A case study from New Zealand
Agile project management methods such as Scrum are being used increasingly in a wide range of contexts, including the public sector. This paper reports on a policy development project within a New Zealand government agency, which experimented with Scrum. Data collected from multiple semi-structured interviews and project documents were analysed using Theory of Constraints Thinking Processes (TP) tools, to understand the cause and effect relationships between a project's variables and its outcomes. The TP tools were particularly powerful for identifying conditions assumed by Scrum which were not true in our case study, relating to the customer's role and the nature of project deliverables. The TP tools were also used to analyse the project manager's adaptation of Scrum to accommodate these specific requirements of this project. The case demonstrates that policy development shares standard project management concerns and would benefit from being managed as a project.",0,1,1
"Cost-Benefit Analysis of Moving-Target Defense in Power Grids
We study moving-target defense (MTD) that actively perturbs transmission line reactances to thwart stealthy false data injection (FDI) attacks against state estimation in a power grid. Prior work on this topic has proposed MTD based on randomly selected reactance perturbations, but these perturbations cannot guarantee effective attack detection. To address the issue, we present formal design criteria to select MTD reactance perturbations that are truly effective. However, based on a key optimal power flow (OPF) formulation, we find that the effective MTD may incur a non-trivial operational cost that has not hitherto received attention. Accordingly, we characterize important tradeoffs between the MTD's detection capability and its associated required cost. Extensive simulations, using the MATPOWER simulator and benchmark IEEE bus systems, verify and illustrate the proposed design approach that for the first time addresses both key aspects of cost and effectiveness of the MTD.",1,1,1
"The Tracking Algorithm of Reentry Ballistic Target
By analyzing the force of the ballistic reentry ∞ight, the three-dimensional motion model of ballistic missile has been constructed without ballistic coe‐cient. Because the aerodynamics force is complex in reentry trajectory, the estimation of aerodynamic force can convert to the estimation of ballistic coe‐cient. Extended Kalman Filter, Unscented Kalman Filter and Unscented Particle Filter have been used to design tracking algorithm of re-entry ballistic target. The results of the simulation verify that the motion model of the reentry ∞ight segment is correct. Advantages and disadvantages of difierent algorithms also have been analyzed. On tracking target of reentry ballistic missile, the extended Kalman fllter has poor stability and easily dissipates. The unscented particle fllter algorithm has large computation and slow convergence, but the adaptability, stability and accuracy in the ∞icker noise condition are better than UKF and EKF. The Unscented Kalman Filter is a compromise algorithm which has moderate amount of computation and accuracy.",0,1,1
"Deliberative Platform Design: The case study of the online discussions in Decidim Barcelona
With the irruption of ICTs and the crisis of political representation, many online platforms have been developed with the aim of improving participatory democratic processes. However, regarding platforms for online petitioning, previous research has not found examples of how to effectively introduce discussions, a crucial feature to promote deliberation. In this study we focus on the case of Decidim Barcelona, the online participatory-democracy platform launched by the City Council of Barcelona in which proposals can be discussed with an interface that combines threaded discussions and comment alignment with the proposal. This innovative approach allows to examine whether neutral, positive or negative comments are more likely to generate discussion cascades. The results reveal that, with this interface, comments marked as negatively aligned with the proposal were more likely to engage users in online discussions and, therefore, helped to promote deliberative decision making.",1,1,0
"Dynamic Customer Embeddings for Financial Service Applications
As financial services (FS) companies have experienced drastic technology driven changes, the availability of new data streams provides the opportunity for more comprehensive customer understanding. We propose Dynamic Customer Embeddings (DCE), a framework that leverages customers’ digital activity and a wide range of financial context to learn dense representations of customers in the FS industry. Our method examines customer actions and pageviews within a mobile or web digital session, the sequencing of the sessions themselves, and snapshots of common financial features across our organization at the time of login. We test our customer embeddings using real world data in three prediction problems: 1) the intent of a customer in their next digital session, 2) the probability of a customer calling the call centers after a session, and 3) the probability of a digital session to be fraudulent. DCE showed performance lift in all three downstream problems.",0,0,0
"F0-estimation-based primary ambient extraction for stereo signals
Primary-ambient extraction (PAE) plays an increasingly important role in spatial audio reproduction to achieve an immersive listening experience. The existing PAE algorithms produce notable extraction errors, especially when the primary components are relatively small in magnitude as compared to the ambient components. In this paper, an F0-estimation-based PAE method is proposed. This method explores harmonic structures of the primary components to tap the full potential and utilize the sparsity constraint. The experiment results validate that the F0-estimation-based PAE method achieves 5 dB lower extraction errors than the principal component analysis (PCA) method and the ambient phase estimation with a sparsity constraint (APES) method.",0,1,1

"Conceptualising Contestability
As the use of algorithmic systems in high-stakes decision-making increases, the ability to contest algorithmic decisions is being recognised as an important safeguard for individuals. Yet, there is little guidance on what 'contestability'--the ability to contest decisions--in relation to algorithmic decision-making requires. Recent research presents different conceptualisations of contestability in algorithmic decision-making. We contribute to this growing body of work by describing and analysing the perspectives of people and organisations who made submissions in response to Australia's proposed 'AI Ethics Framework', the first framework of its kind to include 'contestability' as a core ethical principle. Our findings reveal that while the nature of contestability is disputed, it is seen as a way to protect individuals, and it resembles contestability in relation to human decision-making. We reflect on and discuss the implications of these findings.",0,0,0
"An Overview of Ultra-WideBand (UWB) Standards(IEEE 802.15.4, FiRa, Apple): Interoperability Aspects and Future Research Directions
This work has been submitted to the IEEE for possible publication. Copyright may be transferred without notice, after which this version may no longer be accessible Abstract—The increasing popularity of ultra-wideband (UWB) technology for location-based services such as access control and real-time indoor track&tracing, as well as UWB support in new consumer devices such as smartphones, has resulted in the availability of multiple new UWB radio chips. However, due to this increase in UWB device availability, the question of which (industry) standards and configuration factors impact UWB interoperability and compatibility becomes increasingly important. In this paper, the fundamentals of UWB compatibility are investigated by first giving an overview of different UWB radio chips on the market. After that, an overview of UWB standards and standardisation entities is given. Next, this overview is used to discuss the focus of these different standards and to identify the differences between them. We describe compatibility issues and associated interoperability aspects related to PHY, MAC, and upper layers. For the PHY layer, compatibility is possible for all UWB chips if the correct settings are configured. For the MAC layer, the implementation of the multiple access scheme as well as the localization technique is mostly proprietary. For the device discovery, several standards are currently being drafted. Finally, future challenges related to UWB interoperability are discussed.",0,0,0
"Capacity Expansion in the Integrated Supply Network for an Electricity Market
Constraints in fuel supply, electricity generation, and transmission interact to affect the welfare of strategic generators and price-sensitive consumers. We consider a mixed integer bilevel programming model in which the leader makes capacity expansion decisions in the fuel transportation, generation, and transmission infrastructure of the electricity supply network to maximize social welfare less investment cost. Based on the leader's expansion decisions, the multiple followers including the fuel suppliers, ISO, and generation companies simultaneously optimize their respective objectives of cost, social welfare, and profit. The bilevel program is formulated as a mathematical program with complementarity constraints. The computational challenge posed by the discrete character of transmission expansions has been managed by multiple model reformulations. A lower bound provided by a nonlinear programming reformulation increases the efficiency of solving a binary variable reformulation to global optimality. A single-level optimization relaxation serves as a competitive benchmark to assess the effect of generator strategic operational behavior on the optimal capacity configuration.",0,1,0
"Pilot Directional Protection Scheme for LCC-HVDC Transmission Lines Based on the Voltage difference Between Positive and Negative Poles
Currently available DC line protection methods for AC/DC hybrid systems present poor immunity to fault resistance for in-zone faults and mal-operation problems for out-of-zone faults. This paper proposes a new pilot directional protection scheme based on the voltage difference between positive and negative poles (VDPN). The proposed method is not affected by the fault location, the fault resistance, or lightning interference. By analyzing the conducting states of the converter in different time intervals, the differential expressions of the injected current from AC system to DC system are derived. Calculation models of VDPN in different conducting states are built. Then, according to the consistency between the calculated value and actual value of voltage difference, the protection criterion for DC line fault is constructed. Finally, simulation tests in RT-LAB verify that the proposed scheme can correctly identify in-zone and out-of-zone faults in different fault cases. Besides, the proposed scheme has low demand on data synchronicity, thus it is simple and reliable with a good operation speed.",0,0,1

"Synchronization in electric power networks with inherent heterogeneity up to 100% inverter-based renewable generation
The synchronized operation of power generators is the foundation of electric power network stability and a key to the prevention of undesired power outages and blackouts. Here, we derive the conditions that guarantee synchronization in power networks with inherent generator heterogeneity when subjected to small perturbations, and perform a parametric sensitivity analysis to understand synchronization with varied types of generators. As inverter-based resources, which are the primary interfacing technology for many renewable sources of energy, have supplanted synchronous generators in ever growing numbers, the center of attention on associated integration challenges have resided primarily on the role of declining system inertia. Our results instead highlight the critical role of generator damping in achieving a stable state of synchronization. Additionally, we report the feasibility of operating interconnected electric grids with up to 100% power contribution from inverter-based renewable generation technologies. Our study has important implications as it sets the basis for the development of advanced control architectures and grid optimization methods that ensure synchronization and further pave the path towards the decarbonization of the electric power sector.",0,0,1

"A New Metric for Lumpy and Intermittent Demand Forecasts: Stock-keeping-oriented Prediction Error Costs
Forecasts of product demand are essential for short- and long-term optimization of logistics and production. Thus, the most accurate prediction possible is desirable. In order to optimally train predictive models, the deviation of the forecast compared to the actual demand needs to be assessed by a proper metric. However, if a metric does not represent the actual prediction error, predictive models are insufficiently optimized and, consequently, will yield inaccurate predictions. The most common metrics such as MAPE or RMSE, however, are not suitable for the evaluation of forecasting errors, especially for lumpy and intermittent demand patterns, as they do not sufficiently account for, e.g., temporal shifts (prediction before or after actual demand) or cost-related aspects. 
Therefore, we propose a novel metric that, in addition to statistical considerations, also addresses business aspects. Additionally, we evaluate the metric based on simulated and real demand time series from the automotive aftermarket.",0,0,0

"Does the Form of Employment Make a Difference?--Commitment of Traditional, Temporary, and Self-Employed Workers.
Abstract Increasing change in the labor market has produced new forms of employment. A growing number of people have temporary jobs or are self-employed freelancers. The aim of our study is to address these changes by introducing commitment to the form of employment as a new focus in commitment. In addition, we compare organizational commitment under conditions of these forms of employment to traditional form of employment. The study is based on several samples representing conventional and new forms of employment (overall N  = 494). The results indicate that commitment to the form of employment explains variance of organizational outcomes over and above organizational commitment. Generally, commitment to the form of employment reflects an important attitude to the work situation besides commitment to the organization or occupation.

"Risk-Aware Dynamic Reserve Prices of Programmatic Guarantee in Display Advertising
Display advertising is one important online advertising type where banner advertisements (shortly ad) on websites are usually measured by how many times they are viewed by online users. There are two major channels to sell ad views. They can be auctioned off in real time or be directly sold through guaranteed contracts in advance. The former is also known as real-time bidding (RTB), in which media buyers come to a common marketplace to compete for a single ad view and this inventory will be allocated to a buyer in milliseconds by an auction model. Unlike RTB, buying and selling guaranteed contracts are not usually programmatic but through private negotiations as advertisers would like to customise their requests and purchase ad views in bulk. In this paper, we propose a simple model that facilitates the automation of direct sales. In our model, a media seller puts future ad views on sale and receives buy requests sequentially over time until the future delivery period. The seller maintains a hidden yet dynamically changing reserve price in order to decide whether to accept a buy request or not. The future supply and demand are assumed to be well estimated and static, and the model's revenue management is using inventory control theory where each computed reverse price is based on the updated supply and demand, and the unsold future ad views will be auctioned off in RTB to the meet the unfulfilled demand. The model has several desirable properties. First, it is not limited to the demand arrival assumption. Second, it will not affect the current equilibrium between RTB and direct sales as there are no posted guaranteed prices. Third, the model uses the expected revenue from RTB as a lower bound for inventory control and we show that a publisher can receive expected total revenue greater than or equal to those from only RTB if she uses the computed dynamic reserves prices for direct sales.",0,0,0
"Combining Social Force Model with Model Predictive Control for Vehicle's Longitudinal Speed Regulation in Pedestrian-Dense Scenarios
In pedestrian-dense traffic scenarios, an autonomous vehicle may have to safely drive through a crowd of pedestrians while the vehicle tries to keep the desired speed as much as possible. This requires a model that can predict the motion of crowd pedestrians and a method for the vehicle to predictively adjust its speed. In this study, the model-based predictive control (MPC) was combined with a social-force based vehicle-crowd interaction (VCI) model to regulate the longitudinal speed of the autonomous vehicle. The predictive feature of the VCI model can be precisely utilized by the MPC. A criterion for simultaneously guaranteeing pedestrian safety and keeping the desired speed was designed, and consequently, the MPC was formulated as a standard quadratic programming (QP) problem, which can be easily solved by standard QP toolbox. The proposed approach was compared with the traditional proportional-integral-derivative (PID) control approach for regulating longitudinal speed. Scenarios of different pedestrian density were evaluated in simulation. The results demonstrated the merits of the proposed method to address this type of problem. It also shows the potential of extending the method to address more complex vehicle-pedestrian interaction situations.",0,1,1

"Solar Cell Parameter Estimation Using School-Based Optimization Algorithm
Recently, great challenges emerged in the field of using renewable energy sources, and one of the most important of these challenges is the use of solar energy, so many researches have been done to show the behavior of solar photovoltaic (PV) cells through the current-voltage characteristic (I-V), which is determined by the circuit model's parameters. Therefore, the importance of extraction of the cell model parameters is necessary for conducting studies of controlling solar PV systems. The main goal of this article is to identify solar cell parameters using school-based optimization (SBO) algorithm. By comparing the results obtained by the SBO with those obtained by other previously published algorithms, the effectiveness and accuracy of SBO are proved. The proposed parameter estimation algorithm is applied for each of the two mathematical models (single-diode and double-diode) of the solar cell. The accuracy of the proposed algorithm was checked through current-voltage (I-V) and power-voltage (P-V) characteristics regarding the corresponding measured ones.",0,1,1
"Multiagent Genetic Algorithm: An Online Probabilistic View on Economic Dispatch of Energy Hubs Constrained by Wind Availability
Multiple energy carriers (MECs) have been broadly engrossing power system planners and operators toward a modern standpoint in power system studies. Energy hub, though playing an undeniable role as the intermediate in implementing the MECs, still needs to be put under examination in both modeling and operating concerns. Since wind power continues to be one of the fastest-growing energy resources worldwide, its intrinsic challenges should be also treated as an element of crucial role in the vision of future energy networks. In response, this paper aims to concentrate on the online economic dispatch (ED) of MECs for which it provides a probabilistic ED optimization model. The presented model is treated via a robust optimization technique, i.e., multiagent genetic algorithm (MAGA), whose outstanding feature is to find well the global optima of the ED problem. ED once constrained by wind power availability, in the cases of wind power as one of the input energy carriers of the hub, faces an inevitable uncertainty that is also probabilistically overcome in the proposed model. Efficiently approached via MAGA, the presented scheme is applied to test systems equipped with energy hubs and as expected, introduces its applicability and robustness in the ED problems.",0,0,1

"Optimizing CML-CMOS Converter Through Sizing Transistors for Producing 50% Duty Square Wave
The current-mode logic (CML) circuits are widely used in several ICs for its low power dissipation and high speed performance. As the analog and digital mixed ICs are widely used, this implies great advantage of CML circuits. A drawback of the CML circuit is its less robustness of noises than static CMOS circuits because of its small signal swing. Thus, combined application of CML and static CMOS circuits in a single IC is inevitable, and also the CML-CMOS converter is important to combine them together in a chip. In this paper, by sizing transistors of a comparator, the CML-CMOS converter accomplishes the rail-to-rail output signal with 50.14% duty cycle. Rising/falling time of the output signal are lessened by 87.3~90% compared with input CML signal. D-Q delay of the comparator is optimized by 216~239ps.",0,0,1

"FGMO Trial for frequency regulation in Bangladesh Power System
Load and generation balance exactly in nominal frequency is a rare phenomenon for any power system. Frequency regulation is to maintain the balance between demand and supply in real time. Power Grid Company of Bangladesh (PGCB) is the transmission Grid operator for Bangladesh power system (BPS). PGCB tries to maintain a near real-time balance between generation and load and adjusts generation to manage power flows through interconnected transmission lines. PGCB do not have any primary or supplementary control for frequency regulation rather it does manually with the help of their own IP phone network. The frequency of BPS continuously fluctuates to a big extent because of absence of primary control (governor action) for frequency regulation. That's why the NLDC (National Load Dispatch Centre) of PGCB has a tendency to run the system at little bit higher than nominal frequency, so that they can be advantageous during contingencies. But operating power system in this way is waste of huge amount of primary energy. To overcome these difficulties, PGCB thought about free governor mode of operation (FGMO) and arranged a first time weeklong real-time trial on BPS for practical understanding about primary control for frequency regulation. In this Paper, an investigation is made on this trial to demonstrate frequency regulation and generator response by adopting Free Governor Mode of Operation.",0,1,1

"Comparison Between Direct and Indirect Field Oriented Control of Induction Motor
Vector control, also called fieldoriented control (FOC), is a Variable frequency Drive (VFD) control method in which the stator currents of a 3 phase induction motor are identified as two orthogonal components that can be visualized with a vector. The vector control of induction motors is one of the most suitable and popular speed control technique presently used. The vector control technique decouples the two components of stator current space vector: one providing the control of flux and the other providing the control of torque. The two components are defined in the synchronously rotating reference frame. With the help of this control technique the induction motor can replace a separately excited dc motor. The scalar control technique is simple to implement but have the coupling effect ultimately responsible for the sluggish response, which leads to instability due to higher order system effect. The DC motor needs time to time maintenance of commutator, brushes and brush holders. The main effort is to replace DC motor by an induction motor and merge the advantages of both the motors together into variable speed brushless motor drive and eliminate the associated problems. The squirrel cage induction motor being simple, rugged, and cheap and requiring less maintenance, has been widely used motor for fixed speed application. The induction motor is transformed from a non-linear to linear control plant. It is expected that with increasing computational power of the DSP controllers, it will eventually nearly universally displace scalar volts -per-Hertz (V/f) control. In this paper we will come to know the concept of vector control and different types of vector control techniques available. And finally we will be able to compare them.

"Predicting Individual Treatment Effects of Large-scale Team Competitions in a Ride-sharing Economy
Millions of drivers worldwide have enjoyed financial benefits and work schedule flexibility through a ride-sharing economy, but meanwhile they have suffered from the lack of a sense of identity and career achievement. Equipped with social identity and contest theories, financially incentivized team competitions have been an effective instrument to increase drivers' productivity, job satisfaction, and retention, and to improve revenue over cost for ride-sharing platforms. While these competitions are overall effective, the decisive factors behind the treatment effects and how they affect the outcomes of individual drivers have been largely mysterious. In this study, we analyze data collected from more than 500 large-scale team competitions organized by a leading ride-sharing platform, building machine learning models to predict individual treatment effects. Through a careful investigation of features and predictors, we are able to reduce out-sample prediction error by more than 24%. Through interpreting the best-performing models, we discover many novel and actionable insights regarding how to optimize the design and the execution of team competitions on ride-sharing platforms. A simulated analysis demonstrates that by simply changing a few contest design options, the average treatment effect of a real competition is expected to increase by as much as 26%. Our procedure and findings shed light on how to analyze and optimize large-scale online field experiments in general.",0,0,0

"Spatial Pattern Recognition with Adjacency-Clustering: Improved Diagnostics for Semiconductor Wafer Bin Maps
In semiconductor manufacturing, statistical quality control hinges on an effective analysis of wafer bin maps, wherein a key challenge is to detect how defective chips tend to spatially cluster on a wafer--a problem known as spatial pattern recognition. Detecting defect patterns on a wafer can deliver key diagnostics about the root causes of defects and assist production engineers in mitigating future failures. Recently, there has been a growing interest in mixed-type spatial pattern recognition--when multiple defect patterns, of different shapes, co-exist on the same wafer. Mixed-type spatial pattern recognition entails two central tasks: (1) spatial filtering, to distinguish systematic patterns from random noises; and (2) spatial clustering, to group the filtered patterns into distinct defect types. Observing that spatial filtering is instrumental to high-quality pattern recognition, we propose to use a graph-theoretic method called adjacency-clustering, which leverages spatial dependence among adjacent defective chips to effectively filter the raw wafer bin maps. Tested on real-world data and compared against a state-of-the-art approach, our proposed method achieves at least 49% gain in terms of internal cluster validation quality (i.e., validation without external class labels), and about 6% gain in terms of Normalized Mutual Information--an external cluster validation metric based on external class labels. Interestingly, the margin of improvement appears to be a function of the defect pattern complexity, with larger gains achieved for more complex-shaped patterns. This superior performance is a testament to the method's promising impact to semiconductor manufacturing, as well as other contexts where mixed-type spatial patterns are prevalent.",0,0,0
"All-day fresh water harvesting by microstructured hydrogel membranes
Solar steam water purification and fog collection are two independent processes that could enable abundant fresh water generation. We developed a hydrogel membrane that contains hierarchical three-dimensional microstructures with high surface area that combines both functions and serves as an all-day fresh water harvester. At night, the hydrogel membrane efficiently captures fog droplets and directionally transports them to a storage vessel. During the daytime, it acts as an interfacial solar steam generator and achieves a high evaporation rate of 3.64 kg m−2 h−1 under 1 sun enabled by improved thermal/vapor flow management. With a homemade rooftop water harvesting system, this hydrogel membrane can produce fresh water with a daily yield of ~34 L m−2 in an outdoor test, which demonstrates its potential for global water scarcity relief.",0,1,1
"Estimation of PWM - Induced Iron Loss in IPM Machines Incorporating the Impact of Flux Ripple Waveshape and Nonlinear Magnetic Characteristics
This paper presents an improved estimation model to predict the additional iron loss due to pulsewidth modulation (PWM) switching in interior permanent magnet (IPM) machines. The input current including the predicted PWM-induced current ripple is fed to 2-D finite-element analysis to calculate the PWM-induced flux ripple distribution in the analyzed machine. A special frequency decomposition method is proposed to separate the predicted flux ripple into 1x and 2x PWM frequency components. Combining these results with the modified dynamic Jiles-Atherton model, the PWM-induced iron loss is calculated incorporating the impact of the actual flux ripple waveshape and the lamination steel's nonlinear magnetic characteristics. Experiments have been conducted to evaluate the prediction accuracy and investigate the impact of several factors on PWM-induced core losses (i.e., both iron and magnet loss) in IPM machines. These results demonstrate that the model offers promising estimation accuracy over a wide range of machine and inverter operating conditions.",0,0,1
"Insurance customer segmentation using clustering approach
Customers segmentation enables companies to identify the high-profit customers. Clustering algorithms are commonly used for customer segmentation. In this study, K-means clustering algorithms are employed to identify profitable customers in an insurance company. The optimum number of clusters is determined using 'NbClust' package in R software through calculating 23 clustering evaluation metrics. The clustering is accomplished on insurance customers on the basis of 16 customers' features, and ten insurance feature using CRISP methodology. The results show that the customers of insurance company are divided into three groups labelled as 'profitable customers', 'potential profitable customers', and 'disinterested customers'. On the basis of the results of this study, associated customer relationship management (CRM) strategies are proposed to establish suitable marketing and communication plans for each cluster of customers.",0,1,0
"Radar-based Materials Classification Using Deep Wavelet Scattering Transform: A Comparison of Centimetre vs. Millimetre Wave Units
Radar-based materials detection received significant attention in recent years for its potential inclusion in consumer and industrial applications like object recognition for grasping and manufacturing quality assurance and control. Several radar publications were developed for material classification under controlled settings with specific materials' properties and shapes. Recent literature has challenged the earlier findings on radars-based materials classification claiming that earlier solutions are not easily scaled to industrial applications due to issues such as the analog-to-digital converters' high sensitivity to target aspect angle, noise fluctuations due to temperature and other external conditions and sensor orientation. Published experiments on the impact of the aforementioned factors on the robustness of the extracted radar-based traditional features have already demonstrated that the application of deep neural networks can mitigate, to some extent, the impact to produce a viable solution. However, previous studies lacked an investigation of the usefulness of lower frequency radar units, specifically <10 GHz, against the higher range units around and above 60GHz. To address the aforementioned investigation, this research considers two radar units with different frequency ranges: the Walabot-3D (6.3-8 GHz) cm-wave and IMAGEVK-74 (62-69 GHz) mm-wave imaging units by Vayyar Imaging. A comparison is presented on the applicability of each unit for material classification. This work also extends upon previous efforts, by applying deep wavelet scattering transform for the identification of different materials based on the reflected signals received by these units. In the wavelet scattering feature extractor, data is propagated through a series of wavelet transform",0,0,0
"Large teams develop and small teams disrupt science and technology
One of the most universal trends in science and technology today is the growth of large teams in all areas, as solitary researchers and small teams diminish in prevalence1–3. Increases in team size have been attributed to the specialization of scientific activities3, improvements in communication technology4,5, or the complexity of modern problems that require interdisciplinary solutions6–8. This shift in team size raises the question of whether and how the character of the science and technology produced by large teams differs from that of small teams. Here we analyse more than 65 million papers, patents and software products that span the period 1954–2014, and demonstrate that across this period smaller teams have tended to disrupt science and technology with new ideas and opportunities, whereas larger teams have tended to develop existing ones. Work from larger teams builds on more-recent and popular developments, and attention to their work comes immediately. By contrast, contributions by smaller teams search more deeply into the past, are viewed as disruptive to science and technology and succeed further into the future—if at all. Observed differences between small and large teams are magnified for higher-impact work, with small teams known for disruptive work and large teams for developing work. Differences in topic and research design account for a small part of the relationship between team size and disruption; most of the effect occurs at the level of the individual, as people move between smaller and larger teams. These results demonstrate that both small and large teams are essential to a flourishing ecology of science and technology, and suggest that, to achieve this, science policies should aim to support a diversity of team sizes.Analyses of the output produced by large versus small teams of researchers and innovators demonstrate that their work differs systematically in the extent to which it disrupts or develops existing science and technology.",0,1,0
"Feature-Level Rating System Using Customer Reviews and Review Votes
This work studies how we can obtain feature-level ratings of the mobile products from the customer reviews and review votes to influence decision-making, both for new customers and manufacturers. Such a rating system gives a more comprehensive picture of the product than what a product-level rating system offers. While product-level ratings are too generic, feature-level ratings are particular; we exactly know what is good or bad about the product. There has always been a need to know which features fall short or are doing well according to the customer’s perception. It keeps both the manufacturer and the customer well-informed in the decisions to make in improving the product and buying, respectively. Different customers are interested in different features. Thus, feature-level ratings can make buying decisions personalized. We analyze the customer reviews collected on an online shopping site (Amazon) about various mobile products and the review votes. Explicitly, we carry out a feature-focused sentiment analysis for this purpose. Eventually, our analysis yields ratings to 108 features for 4000+ mobiles sold online. It helps in decision-making on how to improve the product (from the manufacturer’s perspective) and in making the personalized buying decisions (from the buyer’s perspective) a possibility. Our analysis has applications in recommender systems, consumer research, and so on.",0,0,0

"APPLICATION OF A BIVARIATE RATIONAL INTERPOLATION IN IMAGE ZOOMING
This paper presents a new method for image zooming. The new method is different from the traditional polynomial interpolation technique. A bivariate rational interpolation is used in the new method. Using the bivariate rational interpolation is more effective than the polynomial interpolation for image zooming, especially in processing the borders of the source image. The bivariate rational interpolation function has a simple and explicit expression, thus facilitating application of image zooming. Looking upon image data as interpolation data, an interpolation surface is constructed. According to the need of zooming, resampling the gray value on the interpolation surface with a zooming scale, the image zooming can be achieved. The advantage of the new method is the simplicity as well as the high performance. Experimentations show that the new method is able to maintain the borders of source images clearly. Furthermore, the algorithm is efficient in computation for image zooming.",0,0,1
"Review on Wastewater Treatment Technologies
Nowadays, water resources are becoming increasingly scarce and many of them are polluted by anthropogenic sources such as industrial purpose, agricultural waste and household. Therefore, the treatment of wastewater remains a critical need before leaving it to natural water streams. The main purpose of wastewater treatment is to remove the various contaminants that presence in the wastewater such as suspended solids, organic carbon, nutrients, inorganic salts, heavy metals, pathogens and so on. The ultimate goal of the wastewater treatment is to provide the protection in terms of human health and environmental aspect. In this article, the use of wastewater treatment methods such as biofilm technology, aerobic granulation and microbial fuel cell are discussed briefly. Introduction Water resources are becoming increasingly scarce around the world due to the growing imbalance between freshwater availability and consumption, therefore the access to clean and safe water has become one of the major challenges of our modern society [1]. Water demand is keep increasing due to the following reasons:  Increasing of population and migration to drought prone regions;  Rapid industrial development and increasing water use per capita;  Climate change leading to changing weather patterns in populated areas [2] 112 Ta Wee Seow et al On the other hand, the water quality is threatened by the presence of a large number pathogens [3] and anthropogenic chemicals that entering the urban and rural water bodies [4]. Discharges of wastewater from municipal and industrial treatment plants have been recognised as one of the major factors of aquatic pollution around the world [5]. In many developing countries, the bulk of domestic and industrial wastewater is directly discharged into water streams without go through any treatment processes or after primary treatment only [6]. Even a highly industrialised country such as China, approximately 55% of their sewage was discharged without any treatment [7]. The discharge of untreated wastewater to the water bodies without any treatment processes will leads to several environmental problems such as:  Untreated wastewater which contains a large amount of organic matter will consume the dissolved oxygen for satisfying the biochemical oxygen demand (BOD) of wastewater and thus, deplete the dissolved oxygen of the water stream required by the aquatic lives;  Untreated wastewater usually contains a large amount of pathogenic, or disease causing microorganisms and toxic compounds, that can dwell in the human intestinal tract thus threatening the human health;  Wastewater may also contain certain amount of nutrients, which can stimulate the growth of aquatic plants and algal blooms, thus, leading to eutrophication of the lakes and streams;  The decomposition of the organic compounds present in wastewater can lead to the production of large quantities of malodorous gases [8] Therefore, the treatment of wastewater is a must before leaving it enters the natural water bodies. Different physical and chemical treatment methods have been reviewed for the treatment of wastewater such as biological degradation, ion exchange, chemical precipitation, adsorption, reverse osmosis, coagulation, flocculation, etc. All these treatment methods have different performance characteristics and also different direct impacts on the environment. This review will particularly discuss the application of biofilm technology, biogranulation and microbial fuel cell (MFC) for the treatment of wastewater. Biofilm technology Definition of biofilm itself is simply defined as communities or clusters of microorganisms that attached to a surface [9-10]. Formation of biofilm could be achieved by a single or multispecies of microorganisms that have the ability to form at biotic and abiotic surfaces [9]. As a general, there are few steps that important for development of biofilm, which starting with the initial attachment and establishment to the surface, followed by maturation, and finally, the detachment of cells from surface [9-11]. Review On Wastewater Treatment Technologies 113 Figure 1: Process of biofilm development [9] According to Watnick and Kolter [11], the formation of a bacterial biofilm is a same with community that is built by human. First, the bacterium must approaches closely before form a transient attachment with the surface and/or other microorganisms that formerly attached to the surface. This step of transient attachment allows the bacterium to search a place before adapting it. After the bacterium has finally settled down, it will form a stable attachment and associate into a microcolony, which is the bacterium has chosen the neighbourhood to live. Finally, the building of biofilm is established and irregularly, the biofilm-associated bacteria will detach from biofilm surface. The uses of biological treatment process have taken into placed compared to physical and chemical method in terms of their efficiency and economy [12]. One of the biological methods that have been realised to overcome the bioremediation problems is biofilm. According to Decho [13], biofilm-mediated bioremediation hands a capability and safer option to bioremediation with planktonic microorganisms. The reason behind this is because the cells in a biofilm have a high potentially to survive and adapt towards the process as they are protected by the matrices. Moreover, microbial consortium in the form of biofilm has the ability to decolourise and metabolise dyes since there are intrinsic cellular mechanisms that will bring aboutthe degradation or biosorption of dyestuffs [11]. Advantages: Biofilm offers a proficient and harmless option to bioremediation with planktonic microorganisms since the cells in biofilm have a highly chance of adaptation and survival, particularly in unfavourable conditions. This situation is due to the matrix that actually acts as a barrier and protects the cells within it from environmental distress [13]. Extracellular polymeric substances or EPS have significant towards the growth of biofilm which it appears that to be a part of protective mechanism for biofilm community. Wingender et al. [14] reported that EPS can minimise the impact 114 Ta Wee Seow et al of modification in pH, temperature, and concentration of toxic substances. Biofilm can have very long biomass residence times when treatment requires slow growing organisms with poor biomass yield or when the concentration of wastewater is too low to sustain growth of activated sludge flocs [15]. Application in wastewater treatment: Biofilm has becoming an interest subject to be explored, especially in the perspective of wastewater treatment, therefore, many studies has performed in order to achieve and gain understanding towards of the utilisation of biofilm to remediate the environment. Aerobic fluidised bed reactor, rotating biological contactors, aerobic membrane bioreactor are a few applications of biofilm reactors that have been invented to treat various condition of wastewater produced by the industrial. A summary of biofilm reactors that are used treating wastewater is showed in Table 1. Table 1: Lists of biofilm reactors used for the wastewater treatment Description Type of wastewater References Aerobic membrane bioreactor (MBR) functions as dual mechanism which membrane filtration occurs along with biodegradation processes water and small solution molecules pass through the membrane while solid materials, biomass, and macromolecules are retained in the reactor Can treat highstrength synthetic wastewater [16] Rotating biological contactor (RBC) operates by attaching microorganisms to an inert support matrix to form a biofilm support matrix and a sequential disc configuration is placed partially or totally submerged in the reactor and it will rotates around a horizontal axis slowly where the wastewater flows through into it Can treat highstrength synthetic wastewater with chemical oxygen demand (COD) concentration up to 12000 mg/L [17] Anaerobic−aerobic granular biofilm bioreactor granular biofilm bioreactor consists of an upflow anaerobic sludge bed (UASB), having an aeration column or sparger placed in the middle of the reactor anaerobic and aerobic populations of the biofilm co-exist closely in the same reactor offers a good strategy to complete mineralisation of highly substituted compounds Treat various chlorinated pollutants [18] Review On Wastewater Treatment Technologies 115 Anaerobic-aerobic fixed film bioreactor (FFB) combination of two fixed-film bioreactor with arranged media (anaerobic and aerobic) connected in series with recirculation system gives advantages as less sensitivity to environmental variations and higher growth rate due to the used of immobilised cells on the surface of the media Treat wastewater that have high content of oil and grease [19] Integrated anaerobic-aerobic fluidised bed reactor use a cylindrical fluidised bed with pulverised pumice-stone as support material for microorganisms to attach aeration is performed by four cylindrical fine bubble membrane diffusers offers good stability despite variations in organic load and delivers short start-up time for operation Eliminates organic carbon and nitrogen from municipal wastewater [20] Limitations: There are several limitations of biofilm towards the implementation in wastewater treatment. The limitations are [21]:  Biofilm formation on carriers poses problems leading to long start-up times;  Overgrowth of biofilms leads to elutriation of particles;  Control of biofilm thickness is difficult;  Liquid distributors for fluidised systems are costly for large-scale reactors and pose problems with respect to clogging and uniform fluidisation.

The game sends its movement signals which are converted into inputs to the underlying vehicle dynamic model. The equations of motion of the vehicle dynamic model is developed and implemented in real time, so that the actuators underneath the Stewart platform can perform the pushes or pulls that mimic various driving conditions.

"Massive MIMO Performance—TDD Versus FDD: What Do Measurements Say?
Downlink beamforming in Massive multiple-input and multiple-output (MIMO) either relies on uplink pilot measurements—exploiting reciprocity and time-division duplexing operation, or on the use of a predetermined grid of beams with user equipments reporting their preferred beams, mostly in frequency-division duplexing operation. Massive MIMO in its originally conceived form uses the first strategy, with uplink pilots, whereas there is currently significant commercial interest in the second, grid-of-beams. It has been analytically shown that with isotropic scattering (independent Rayleigh fading) the first approach outperforms the second. Nevertheless, there remains controversy regarding their relative performance in practical channels. In this contribution, the performances of these two strategies are compared using measured channel data at 2.6 GHz.",0,1,0

"The hidden assumptions behind counterfactual explanations and principal reasons
Counterfactual explanations are gaining prominence within technical, legal, and business circles as a way to explain the decisions of a machine learning model. These explanations share a trait with the long-established ""principal reason"" explanations required by U.S. credit laws: they both explain a decision by highlighting a set of features deemed most relevant---and withholding others. These ""feature-highlighting explanations"" have several desirable properties: They place no constraints on model complexity, do not require model disclosure, detail what needed to be different to achieve a different decision, and seem to automate compliance with the law. But they are far more complex and subjective than they appear. In this paper, we demonstrate that the utility of feature-highlighting explanations relies on a number of easily overlooked assumptions: that the recommended change in feature values clearly maps to real-world actions, that features can be made commensurate by looking only at the distribution of the training data, that features are only relevant to the decision at hand, and that the underlying model is stable over time, monotonic, and limited to binary outcomes. We then explore several consequences of acknowledging and attempting to address these assumptions, including a paradox in the way that feature-highlighting explanations aim to respect autonomy, the unchecked power that feature-highlighting explanations grant decision makers, and a tension between making these explanations useful and the need to keep the model hidden. While new research suggests several ways that feature-highlighting explanations can work around some of the problems that we identify, the disconnect between features in the model and actions in the real world---and the subjective choices necessary to compensate for this---must be understood before these techniques can be usefully implemented.",0,1,0
"Hercules: An Autonomous Logistic Vehicle for Contact-less Goods Transportation During the COVID-19 Outbreak

"Flexure-based Environmental Compliance for High-speed Robotic Contact Tasks
The design of physical compliance – its location, degree, and structure – affects robot performance and robustness in contact-rich tasks. While compliance is often used in the robot’s joints, flange, or end-effector, this paper proposes compliant structures in the environment, allowing safe and robust contact while keeping the higher motion control bandwidth and precision of high impedance robots. Compliance is here realized with flexures and viscoelastic materials, which are integrated to several mechanisms to offer structured compliance, such as a remote center of compliance. Additive manufacturing with fused deposition modeling is used, allowing faster design iteration and low-cost integration with standard industrial equipment. Mechanical properties, including the total stiffness matrix, stiffness ratio, and rotational precision, are analytically determined and compared to experimental results.

"A MODEL OF CREATIVITY AND INNOVATION IN ORGANIZATIONS
As reported by Amabile et al. (1996:1154): “All innovation begins with creative ideas. We define innovation as the successful implementation of creative ideas within an organization. In this view, creativity by individuals and teams is a starting point for innovation; the first is a necessary but not sufficient condition for the second"". As creativity is an important source of organizational innovation as well as competitive advantage (Amabile, 1988, 1996; Oldham & Cummings, 1996), organizations are increasingly seeking to foster it. Different managerial practices influence the work environment, which is one of the major factors impacting on creativity within business organizations (Couger, 1995). Therefore, managers face the challenge of creating the right context and conditions for creativity to flourish (Shalley, Gilson & Blum, 2000).",0,1,0
"Dissipation of stop-and-go waves via control of autonomous vehicles: Field experiments
Abstract Traffic waves are phenomena that emerge when the vehicular density exceeds a critical threshold. Considering the presence of increasingly automated vehicles in the traffic stream, a number of research activities have focused on the influence of automated vehicles on the bulk traffic flow. In the present article, we demonstrate experimentally that intelligent control of an autonomous vehicle is able to dampen stop-and-go waves that can arise even in the absence of geometric or lane changing triggers. Precisely, our experiments on a circular track with more than 20 vehicles show that traffic waves emerge consistently, and that they can be dampened by controlling the velocity of a single vehicle in the flow. We compare metrics for velocity, braking events, and fuel economy across experiments. These experimental findings suggest a paradigm shift in traffic management: flow control will be possible via a few mobile actuators (less than 5%) long before a majority of vehicles have autonomous capabilities.",0,1,1
"Distracted Driving on the Job: Application of a Modified Stages of Change Model
Abstract Stage-based interventions have been tested and found to be successful in helping people adopt healthy and safe lifestyles. The safety stages of change model, a modified version of Prochaska's transtheoretical framework, shows how workplace safety behavior can progress through five stages: pre-contemplation, contemplation, other-directed action, self-directed action, and maintenance. In this study, we explored the potential application of the safety stages of change model to study the use of cell phones and other electronic communication devices among employees prohibited from using them while driving on company business. About 18% of the study sample was made up of pre-contemplators and contemplators who should be considered a priority for interventions designed to reduce distracted driving in occupational settings. We used a series of discriminant function analyses to predict stage assignment based on a number of psychosocial factors related to employees' attitudes, decisional balance, self-efficacy, and normative beliefs. Even though interpretation of the results was complicated by partial misclassification of cases, the study succeeded in identifying what specific factors may facilitate progression to more advanced behavioral stages among employee drivers. Practical implications are discussed as a blueprint for future stage-based as well as non-staged safety improvement interventions in the workplace.",0,1,0

"GDPR Transparency as a Research Method
Data-driven research is rapidly becoming mainstream across different disciplines in academia and in investigative journalism. One of the key challenges researchers often struggle with is how to obtain good data. Whether one investigates political micro-targeting, discriminatory insurance practices, or physical exercise patterns across demographics, all require high-quality data. Obtaining the necessary data often depends on the goodwill of the entity in control of that data, frequently a private entity carefully guarding its data-assets. Researchers have tried to find ways round this through a range of technical tools (e.g. browser plugins, data scraping), with varying degrees of success. 
 
This paper purports to add an important legal tool to the catalogue of data-driven research methods: i.e. GDPR transparency measures, and data subject rights in particular. The reinforced data subject rights in the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) have been lauded (and denounced) for their apparent potency. Especially the rights of access, portability and ‘explanation’ are said to ensure important values such as autonomy, accountability and fairness. To make true on this promise, these rights can (should?) be used as a methodological tool for investigative research. Not just to scrutinize the data practices of those holding the data (e.g. uncovering discrimination), but also to enable broader research objectives (e.g. informing health policies). Indeed, these rights offer a legal hook to effectively crowdsource data-driven research. 
 
Against this backdrop, the paper will describe the merits, challenges, limitations and best practices of using data subject rights as a research method. It will do so by building on past experiences of some first initiatives in the EU and assessing how the growing number of ‘download my data’ tools are useful/less. After an introductory section setting out some of the issues currently faced in data-driven research, the paper will explain how they might (not) be tackled by some of the key features of using GDPR transparency measures as a research method. The following section (4) is perhaps the core of the paper, describing the legal and practical operationalisation of these novel research methods, as well as the requirements for making them meaningful. The final section then takes a step back, positioning GDPR transparency measures within their broader (research methods and economic-technical) surroundings.",0,1,0
"A Systematic Review of Productivity Factors in Software Development
Analysing and improving productivity has been one of the main goals of software engineering research since its beginnings. A plethora of studies has been conducted on various factors that resulted in several models for analysis and prediction of productivity. However, productivity is still an issue in current software development and not all factors and their relationships are known. This paper reviews the large body of available literature in order to distill a list of the main factors influencing productivity investigated so far. The measure for importance here is the number of articles a factor is mentioned in. Special consideration is given to soft or human-related factors in software engineering that are often not analysed with equal detail as more technical factors. The resulting list can be used to guide further analysis and as basis for building productivity models.",0,0,0
"Multistage Wind Turbine Capability to The Rotor Axial Distance Changes
The multistage wind turbine is one of the Horizontal Axis Wind Turbine developments with the use of two rotors placed on one shaft. This type is developed to maximize energy conversion in a wind turbine by using residual energy from the first rotor. Experimental tests have been conducted to determine the multistage wind turbine capability at axial distance ratios of 0.10, 0.14, and 0.18 in some different wind speeds using wind tunnel. Multistage wind turbine showed a better performance than the single rotor wind turbine in the same tip speed ratio conditions. The maximum multistage wind turbine’s performance achieved in a ratio of 0.18 on a tip speed ratio of 1.4 with the coefficient of power reaching 0.27. The placement of the two rotors affects the amount of wind speed decrease. The amount of wind speed that hits the second rotor determines the additional torque that can be generated in the second rotor to rotate. Different wind speeds will produce a different aerodynamic effect on the multistage wind turbine. The ratio of 0.18 has the largest torque increase up to 37% in the second rotor from the computational result. Increased torque causes an increase in the multistage wind turbine’s performance.",0,1,1
"Security-Constrained Unit Commitment in Presence of Lithium-Ion Battery Storage Units Using Information-Gap Decision Theory
This paper proposes a robust framework for the security-constrained unit commitment (SCUC) of generating units, in the presence of lithium-ion battery energy storage units, using the information-gap decision theory (IGDT) technique. In the suggested model, the degradation cost of the battery storage units has been considered in the objective function as a highly influencing factor in the operation of such storage units. The framework is independent of probability density functions or membership of sets and enables the system operator to adjust the conservatism of the operating strategy (between overconservative and reckless) against the load demand uncertainty. In this respect, the SCUC model has been presented within a day-ahead scheduling problem on the hourly basis using mixed-integer linear programming. Finally, the proposed framework has been simulated on a typical 6-bus test system as well as IEEE 24-bus and IEEE 118-bus systems to verify the efficiency and the effectiveness of the model using the IGDT technique.",0,1,1
"A Gibbs sampling algorithm that estimates the Q-matrix for the DINA model
Abstract Cognitive diagnostic assessment has drawn more attention in recent years, which attempts to evaluate whether an examinee has mastered those cognitive skills or attributes being measured in an assessment. To achieve this objective, a variety of cognitive diagnosis models have been developed. The core element of these models is the Q-matrix, which is a binary matrix that establishes item-to-attribute mapping in an exam. Traditionally, the Q-matrix is fixed and designed by domain experts. However, there are concerns that some domain experts might neglect certain attributes, and that different experts could have different opinions. It is therefore of practical importance to develop an automated method for estimating the attribute-to-item mapping, and the purpose of this study is to develop a Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithm to estimate the Q-matrix in a Bayesian framework.",0,0,0
"Vibration‐based bridge scour detection: A review
Scour around bridge foundations is regarded as one of the predominant causes of bridge failures. Traditional methods primarily employ underwater instruments to detect bridge scour depths, which thus have difficulties in instrument installations and operations. The concept of scour detection derived from vibration‐based damage detection has been explored in recent years to address such difficulties by investigating the natural frequency spectrum of a bridge or a bridge component. This paper presents a comprehensive review of existing studies on scour detection using the natural frequency spectrum of a bridge or a bridge component.

"Real-time simulation of parameter-dependent fluid flows through deep learning-based reduced order models
Simulating fluid flows in different virtual scenarios is of key importance in engineering applications. However, high-fidelity, full-order models relying, e.g., on the finite element method, are unaffordable whenever fluid flows must be simulated in almost real-time. Reduced order models (ROMs) relying, e.g., on proper orthogonal decomposition (POD) provide reliable approximations to parameter-dependent fluid dynamics problems in rapid times. However, they might require expensive hyper-reduction strategies for handling parameterized nonlinear terms, and enriched reduced spaces (or Petrov–Galerkin projections) if a mixed velocity–pressure formulation is considered, possibly hampering the evaluation of reliable solutions in real-time. Dealing with fluid–structure interactions entails even greater difficulties. The proposed deep learning (DL)-based ROMs overcome all these limitations by learning, in a nonintrusive way, both the nonlinear trial manifold and the reduced dynamics. To do so, they rely on deep neural networks, after performing a former dimensionality reduction through POD, enhancing their training times substantially. The resulting POD-DL-ROMs are shown to provide accurate results in almost real-time for the flow around a cylinder benchmark, the fluid–structure interaction between an elastic beam attached to a fixed, rigid block and a laminar incompressible flow, and the blood flow in a cerebral aneurysm.",1,1,1
"Uncertainty Measures in Neural Belief Tracking and the Effects on Dialogue Policy Performance
The ability to identify and resolve uncertainty is crucial for the robustness of a dialogue system. Indeed, this has been confirmed empirically on systems that utilise Bayesian approaches to dialogue belief tracking. However, such systems consider only confidence estimates and have difficulty scaling to more complex settings. Neural dialogue systems, on the other hand, rarely take uncertainties into account. They are therefore overconfident in their decisions and less robust. Moreover, the performance of the tracking task is often evaluated in isolation, without consideration of its effect on the downstream policy optimisation. We propose the use of different uncertainty measures in neural belief tracking. The effects of these measures on the downstream task of policy optimisation are evaluated by adding selected measures of uncertainty to the feature space of the policy and training policies through interaction with a user simulator. Both human and simulated user results show that incorporating these measures leads to improvements both of the performance and of the robustness of the downstream dialogue policy. This highlights the importance of developing neural dialogue belief trackers that take uncertainty into account.",0,1,0
"Control Barrier Functions for Mechanical Systems: Theory and Application to Robotic Grasping
Control barrier functions have been demonstrated to be a useful method of ensuring constraint satisfaction for a wide class of controllers. However, the existing results are mostly restricted to continuous-time systems. Mechanical systems, including robots, are typically second-order systems in which the control occurs at the force/torque level. These systems have actuator, velocity, and position constraints (i.e., relative degree two) that are vital for safety and/or task execution. Additionally, mechanical systems are typically controlled digitally as sampled-data systems. The contribution of this article is twofold. The first contribution is the development of novel, robust control barrier functions that ensure constraint satisfaction for sampled-data systems in the presence of model uncertainty and allows for satisfaction of actuator constraints. The second contribution is the application of the proposed method to the challenging problem of robotic grasping in which a robotic hand must ensure that an object remains inside the grasp while manipulating it to the desired reference trajectory. A grasp constraint satisfying controller is proposed that can admit the existing nominal manipulation controllers from the literature while simultaneously ensuring no slip, no overextension (e.g., singular configurations), and no rolling off of the fingertips. Simulation and experimental results validate the proposed control for the robotic hand application.",1,1,1
"Learning quadrupedal locomotion over challenging terrain
A learning-based locomotion controller enables a quadrupedal ANYmal robot to traverse challenging natural environments. Legged locomotion can extend the operational domain of robots to some of the most challenging environments on Earth. However, conventional controllers for legged locomotion are based on elaborate state machines that explicitly trigger the execution of motion primitives and reflexes. These designs have increased in complexity but fallen short of the generality and robustness of animal locomotion. Here, we present a robust controller for blind quadrupedal locomotion in challenging natural environments. Our approach incorporates proprioceptive feedback in locomotion control and demonstrates zero-shot generalization from simulation to natural environments. The controller is trained by reinforcement learning in simulation. The controller is driven by a neural network policy that acts on a stream of proprioceptive signals. The controller retains its robustness under conditions that were never encountered during training: deformable terrains such as mud and snow, dynamic footholds such as rubble, and overground impediments such as thick vegetation and gushing water. The presented work indicates that robust locomotion in natural environments can be achieved by training in simple domains.",0,1,1
"Adaptive Pressure Control for Use in Variable-Thrust Rocket Development
The precise control of gas generator pressure is important to obtain variable thrust in ducted rockets. A delay resistant closed loop reference model adaptive control is proposed in this paper to address this problem. The proposed controller combines delay compensation and adaptation with improved transient response. The controller is successfully implemented using an industrial grade cold air test setup, which is a milestone towards obtaining a fully developed throttleable rocket gas generator controller. Simulation and experimental comparisons with alternative adaptive approaches and a fixed controller demonstrate improved performance and effective handling of time delays and uncertainties. A step by step design methodology, covering robustfying schemes, selection of adaptation rates and initial controller parameters, is also provided to facilitate implementations.",0,0,1
"A Time-domain Generalized Wiener Filter for Multi-channel Speech Separation
Frequency-domain neural beamformers are the mainstream methods for recent multi-channel speech separation models. Despite their well-defined behaviors and the effectiveness, such frequencydomain beamformers still have the limitations of a bounded oracle performance and the difficulties of designing proper networks for the complex-valued operations. In this paper, we propose a timedomain generalized Wiener filter (TD-GWF), an extension to the conventional frequency-domain beamformers that has higher oracle performance and only involves real-valued operations. We also provide discussions on how TD-GWF can be connected to conventional frequency-domain beamformers. Experiment results show that a significant performance improvement can be achieved by replacing frequency-domain beamformers by the TD-GWF in the recently proposed sequential neural beamforming pipelines.",0,1,1
"On MOSFET Threshold Voltage Extraction Over the Full Range of Drain Voltage Based on Gm/ID
A MOSFET threshold voltage extraction method covering the entire range of drain-to-source voltage, from linear to saturation modes, is presented. Transconductance-to-current ratio is obtained from MOSFET transfer characteristics measured at low to high drain voltage. Based on the charge-based modeling approach, a near-constant value of threshold voltage is obtained over the whole range of drain voltage for ideal, long-channel MOSFETs. The method reveals a distinct increase of threshold voltage versus drain voltage for halo-implanted MOSFETs in the low drain voltage range. The method benefits from moderate inversion operation, where high-field effects, such as vertical field mobility reduction and series resistances, are minimal. The present method is applicable over the full range of drain voltage, is fully analytical, easy to be implemented, and provides more consistent results when compared to existing methods.",0,0,1
"Microbial Degradation Of Plastic - A Review
Since last few decades the uncontrolled use of plastics for various purposes such as packaging, transportation, industry and agriculture in rural as well as urban areas, has elevated serious issue of plastic waste disposal and its pollution. The efficient decomposition of plastic bags takes about 1000 years.  Plastic causes pollution and global warming not only because of increase in the problem of waste disposal and land filling but also release CO 2 and dioxins due to burning. Commonly used methods for plastic disposal were proved to be inadequate for effective plastic waste management, and hence there is growing concern for use of efficient microorganisms meant for biodegradation of non-degradable synthetic polymer. The biodegradable polymers are designed to degrade fast by microbes due their ability to degrade the most of the organic and inorganic materials, including lignin, starch, cellulose and hemicelluloses.  The present review discusses the current status, mechanisms of biodegradation of plastics, techniques for characterizing degraded plastics and factors affecting their biodegradation.",0,1,1
"Dynamic Ready Queue Based Process Priority Scheduling Algorithm
—CPU scheduling is the reason behind the per- formance of multiprocessing and in time-shared operating systems. Different scheduling criteria are used to evaluate Central Processing Unit Scheduling algorithms which are based on different properties of the system. Round Robin is known to be the most recurrent pre-emptive algorithm used in an environment where processes are allotted a unit of time and multiprocessing operating systems. In this paper, a reformed variation of the Round Robin algorithm has been introduced to minimise the completion time, turnaround time, waiting time and number of context switches that results in the better performance of the system. The proposed work consists of calculation of priority on the basis of the difference between time spent in ready upto the moment and arrival time of the process, to ease up the burden on the ready queue. We have also evaluated the performance of the proposed approach on different datasets and measured the different scheduling criteria",1,1,0

"In-Situ Sensing and Dynamics Predictions for Electrothermally-Actuated Soft Robot Limbs
Untethered soft robots that locomote using electrothermally-responsive materials like shape memory alloy (SMA) face challenging design constraints for sensing actuator states. At the same time, modeling of actuator behaviors faces steep challenges, even with available sensor data, due to complex electrical-thermal-mechanical interactions and hysteresis. This article proposes a framework for in-situ sensing and dynamics modeling of actuator states, particularly temperature of SMA wires, which is used to predict robot motions. A planar soft limb is developed, actuated by a pair of SMA coils, that includes compact and robust sensors for temperature and angular deflection. Data from these sensors are used to train a neural network-based on the long short-term memory (LSTM) architecture to model both unidirectional (single SMA) and bidirectional (both SMAs) motion. Predictions from the model demonstrate that data from the temperature sensor, combined with control inputs, allow for dynamics predictions over extraordinarily long open-loop timescales (10 min) with little drift. Prediction errors are on the order of the soft deflection sensor’s accuracy. This architecture allows for compact designs of electrothermally-actuated soft robots that include sensing sufficient for motion predictions, helping to bring these robots into practical application.",1,0,1
"Influence of rear-roof spoiler on the aerodynamic performance of hatchback vehicle
Rear-roof spoiler is commonly used for improving the aerodynamic performance of road vehicles. This study aims to investigate the effect of strip-type rear-roof spoiler on the aerodynamic performance of hatchback vehicles. The main parameter of study was the inclination angle of the spoiler. A computational fluid dynamics (CFD) method was used. The numerically obtained results were compared to the experimental data for validation of the CFD method. The spoiler effectively reduced the aerodynamic lift at positive inclination angle by causing the surface pressure near the roof-spoiler junction to increase. However, its effect is unfavourable when configured at negative angle due to the downward accelerating flow that causes the surface pressure around the roof-spoiler junction to drop. Although the aerodynamic lift was found to decrease with the spoiler angle, this was accompanied by drag increment.",0,1,1
"Putting the micro into the macro: A molecularly-augmented hydrodynamic model of dynamic wetting applied to flow instabilities during forced dewetting
We report a molecularly-augmented continuum-based computational model of dynamic wetting and apply it to the displacement of an externally-driven liquid plug between two partially-wetted parallel plates. The results closely follow those obtained in a recent molecular-dynamics (MD) study of the same problem [29], which we use as a benchmark. We are able to interpret the maximum speed of dewetting U ∗ crit as a fold bifurcation in the steady phase diagram and show that its dependence on the true contact angle θ cl is quantitatively similar to that found using MD. A key feature of the model is that the contact angle is dependent on the speed of the contact line, with θ cl emerging as part of the solution. The model enables us to study the formation of a thin ﬁlm at dewetting speeds U ∗ > U ∗ crit across a range of length scales, including those that are computationally prohibitive to MD simulations. We show that the thickness of the ﬁlm scales linearly with the channel width and is only weakly dependent on the capillary number. This work provides a link between matched asymptotic techniques (valid for larger geometries) and MD simulations (valid for smaller geometries). In addition, we ﬁnd that the apparent angle, the experimentally visible contact angle at the fold bifurcation, is not zero. This is in contrast to the prediction of conventional treatments based on the lubrication model of ﬂow near the contact line, but consistent with experiment.",1,1,1
"Stacked nanosheet gate-all-around transistor to enable scaling beyond FinFET
In this paper, for the first time we demonstrate that horizontally stacked gate-all-around (GAA) Nanosheet structure is a good candidate for the replacement of FinFET at the 5nm technology node and beyond. It offers increased Weff per active footprint and better performance compared to FinFET, and with a less complex patterning strategy, leveraging EUV lithography. Good electrostatics are reported at Lg=12nm and aggressive 44/48nm CPP (Contacted Poly Pitch) ground rules. We demonstrate work function metal (WFM) replacement and multiple threshold voltages, compatible with aggressive sheet to sheet spacing for wide stacked sheets. Stiction of sheets in long-channel devices is eliminated. Dielectric isolation is shown on standard bulk substrate for sub-sheet leakage control. Wrap-around contact (WAC) is evaluated for extrinsic resistance reduction.",0,1,1

"CFD Investigations of Wake Flow Interactions in a Wind Farm with 14 Wind Turbines
Because the wake flow interaction phenomenon among wind turbines has a great influence on aerodynamic power output, wind speed deficit turbulence stress, and wake vortex structure, the wake interaction for the optimal arrangement of wind farm has recently attracted increasing attention. This paper presents a validation of aerodynamics for the two offset model wind turbines on the actuator line model and computational fluid dynamics (CFD) technique. The numerical results of the present simulations are compared with those produced by testing on Blind Test 3 and other simulation models. On the basis of the simulations results, the present study shows good agreement with the experimental results. Besides, considering the uniform inflow condition, a numerical method is harnessed to simulate the complex phenomenon of wake interaction in a wind farm containing 14 wind turbines. Large eddy simulations combined with an actuator line model are conducted in the in-house CFD code FOWT-UALM-SJTU solver, which is an extension based on OpenFOAM. The motivation for this work is to create a sound methodology for performing the simulation of large wind farms. To better understand the wake interaction phenomenon, the aerodynamic power coefficients and basic features of both the near and far wake, including the distribution characteristics of the mean wake velocity and vortex structures, are studied in detail.",0,0,1
"Current Status and Directions of IEEE 802.11be, the Future Wi-Fi 7
While customers rivet their eyes on Wi-Fi 6, in the bowels of the IEEE 802.11 Working Group that creates Wi-Fi standards, the next generation Wi-Fi is being developed. At the very first sight, the new IEEE 802.11be amendment to the Wi-Fi standard is nothing but scaled 11ax with doubled bandwidth and the increased number of spatial streams, which together provide data rates as high as 40 Gbps.

"Developed liquid film passing a smoothed and wedge-shaped trailing edge: small-scale analysis and the ‘teapot effect’ at large Reynolds numbers
Abstract Recently, the authors considered a thin steady developed viscous free-surface flow passing the sharp trailing edge of a horizontally aligned flat plate under surface tension and the weak action of gravity, acting vertically, in the asymptotic slender-layer limit (J. Fluid Mech., vol. 850, 2018, pp. 924–953). We revisit the capillarity-driven short-scale viscous–inviscid interaction, on account of the inherent upstream influence, immediately downstream of the edge and scrutinise flow detachment on all smaller scales. We adhere to the assumption of a Froude number so large that choking at the plate edge is insignificant but envisage the variation of the relevant Weber number of $O(1)$. The main focus, tackled essentially analytically, is the continuation of the structure of the flow towards scales much smaller than the interactive ones and where it no longer can be treated as slender. As a remarkable phenomenon, this analysis predicts harmonic capillary ripples of Rayleigh type, prevalent on the free surface upstream of the trailing edge. They exhibit an increase of both the wavelength and amplitude as the characteristic Weber number decreases. Finally, the theory clarifies the actual detachment process, within a rational description of flow separation. At this stage, the wetting properties of the fluid and the microscopically wedge-shaped edge, viewed as infinitely thin on the larger scales, come into play. As this geometry typically models the exit of a spout, the predicted wetting of the wedge is related to what in the literature is referred to as the teapot effect.",0,0,1

This paper describes a mechanism which has six degrees of freedom, controlled in any combination by six motors, each having a ground abutment. It is considered that by its particular arrangement, this mechanism may form an elegant design for simulating flight conditions in the training of pilots. Unlike most simulators, it has no fixed axes relative to the ground, and therefore within the limits of amplitude of the design it can truly simulate the conditions of banking by carrying the simulation of control surfaces into the axes of the new attitude. Variations in control arrangements are described and their respective design merits considered. Other possible uses for this mechanism are mentioned including automation of production.",0,1,1
"Circular-antenna-array-based codebook design and training method for 60GHz beamforming
Beamforming is necessary in 60GHz millimeterwave communications in order to compensate for high path loss. A complete beamforming algorithm includes codebook design and beam training. The existing beamforming protocol of IEEE 802.15.3c standard has following flaws: (1) Not all three beamforming pattern types (quasi-omni pattern, sector and beam) have their own codebooks; (2) Almost every beam points to two directions, one of which is expected but the other one is unwanted; (3) Setup time of beam training is long. This paper proposes a codebook design and corresponding training procedure based on circular antenna array with a two-layer-structure. It allows every pattern type to own its corresponding codebook and highly directional antenna radiation pattern. The training setup time is reduced to around half of 3c training time. Performance evaluations also manifest that the proposed algorithm leads to less antenna gain loss and more robust performance than the 3c standard.",0,1,0
"Adaptive–Robust Control of Euler–Lagrange Systems With Linearly Parametrizable Uncertainty Bound
This brief proposes a new adaptive–robust control (ARC) architecture for a class of uncertain Euler–Lagrange (EL) systems where the upper bound of the uncertainty satisfies linear in the parameters structure. Conventional ARC strategies either require structural knowledge of the system or presume that the overall uncertainties or its time derivative are norm bounded by a constant. Due to the unmodeled dynamics and modeling imperfection, true structural knowledge of the system is not always available. Furthermore, for the class of systems under consideration, prior assumption, regarding the uncertainties (or its time derivative) being upper bounded by a constant, puts a restriction on the states beforehand. Conventional ARC laws invite overestimation–underestimation problem of switching gain. Toward this front, adaptive switching-gain-based robust control (ASRC) is proposed, which alleviates the overestimation–underestimation problem of switching gain. Moreover, ASRC avoids any presumption of constant upper bound on the overall uncertainties and can negotiate uncertainties regardless of being linear or nonlinear in parameters. Experimental results of ASRC using a wheeled mobile robot note improved control performance in comparison with the adaptive sliding mode control.",0,1,1

"Predicting kinetics using musculoskeletal modeling and inertial motion capture
Inverse dynamic analysis using musculoskeletal modeling is a powerful tool, which is utilized in a range of applications to estimate forces in ligaments, muscles, and joints, non-invasively. To date, the conventional input used in this analysis is derived from optical motion capture (OMC) and force plate (FP) systems, which restrict the application of musculoskeletal models to gait laboratories. To address this problem, we propose a musculoskeletal model, capable of estimating the internal forces based solely on inertial motion capture (IMC) input and a ground reaction force and moment (GRF&M) prediction method. We validated the joint angle and kinetic estimates of the lower limbs against an equally constructed musculoskeletal model driven by OMC and FP system. The sagittal plane joint angles of ankle, knee, and hip presented excellent Pearson correlations (\rho = 0.95, 0.99, and 0.99, respectively) and root-mean-squared differences (RMSD) of 4.1 $\pm$ 1.3$\circ$, 4.4 $\pm$ 2.0$\circ$, and 5.7 $\pm$ 2.1$\circ$, respectively. The GRF&M predicted using IMC input were found to have excellent correlations for three components (vertical:\rho = 0.97, RMSD=9.3 $\pm$ 3.0 %BW, anteroposterior: \rho = 0.91, RMSD=5.5 $\pm$ 1.2 %BW, sagittal: \rho = 0.91, RMSD=1.6 $\pm$ 0.6 %BW*BH), and strong correlations for mediolateral (\rho = 0.80, RMSD=2.1 $\pm$ 0.6%BW ) and transverse (\rho = 0.82, RMSD=0.2 $\pm$ 0.1 %BW*BH). The proposed IMC-based method removes the complexity and space-restrictions of OMC and FP systems and could enable applications of musculoskeletal models in either monitoring patients during their daily lives or in wider clinical practice.",0,0,1

"Assessing the Fairness of AI Systems: AI Practitioners' Processes, Challenges, and Needs for Support
Various tools and practices have been developed to support practitioners in identifying, assessing, and mitigating fairness-related harms caused by AI systems. However, prior research has highlighted gaps between the intended design of these tools and practices and their use within particular contexts, including gaps caused by the role that organizational factors play in shaping fairness work. In this paper, we investigate these gaps for one such practice: disaggregated evaluations of AI systems, intended to uncover performance disparities between demographic groups. By conducting semi-structured interviews and structured workshops with thirty-three AI practitioners from ten teams at three technology companies, we identify practitioners' processes, challenges, and needs for support when designing disaggregated evaluations. We find that practitioners face challenges when choosing performance metrics, identifying the most relevant direct stakeholders and demographic groups on which to focus, and collecting datasets with which to conduct disaggregated evaluations. More generally, we identify impacts on fairness work stemming from a lack of engagement with direct stakeholders or domain experts, business imperatives that prioritize customers over marginalized groups, and the drive to deploy AI systems at scale.",0,1,0

"Analysis and impact of COVID-19 disclosures: is IT-services different from others?
PurposeThere is ambiguity regarding whether coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a boon or bane for the IT services industry. On the one hand, it has created opportunities, especially with the growth of collaborative technologies. On the other hand, many firms have reduced their IT budgets owing to the ongoing recession. This study explores how IT firms have assessed the risk of the pandemic in the early days and informed capital market participants. In addition, it examines the impact of such online disclosures on information asymmetry.Design/methodology/approachThe authors analysed annual reports of publicly listed firms in the USA filed on the Securities and Exchange Commission website in 2020 and examined whether the disclosure scenario of technology firms was different from that of the other industries. Moreover, the risk sentiment of COVID-19-related disclosures was assessed by employing text analytics. Information asymmetry was measured using the bid–ask spread.FindingsOverall, it was found that IT services firms were less likely to discuss the COVID-19 pandemic in their annual reports. Interestingly, it was observed that technology firms that chose to communicate about the pandemic had a lower incidence of words related to risks. Furthermore, communicating about COVID-19 in annual reports calms investors and improves the information asymmetry situation about the firm. Variation in the severity of the pandemic and the responses of state governments was controlled for by employing state-fixed effects in the empirical models.Originality/valueThe authors inform the literature on corporate disclosures and technology and highlight the importance of effectively communicating about the pandemic.",0,0,0
"Blind Dynamic Resource Allocation in Closed Networks via Mirror Backpressure
We study the problem of maximizing payoff generated over a period of time in a general class of closed queueing networks with finite, fixed number of supply units which circulate in the system. Demand arrives stochastically, and serving a demand unit (customer) causes a supply unit to relocate from the ""origin"" to the ""destination"" of the customer. We consider general controls including entry control, pricing, and assignment. Motivating applications include shared transportation platforms and scrip systems. Inspired by the mirror descent algorithm for optimization and the backpressure policy for network control, we introduce a novel family of Mirror Backpressure (MBP) control policies. The MBP policies are simple and practical, and crucially do not need any statistical knowledge of the demand (customer) arrival rates. Under mild conditions, we show that MBP policies lose at most O(K/T +1/K) payoff per customer relative to the optimal policy that knows the demand arrival rates, where K is the number of supply units and T is the total number of customers over the time horizon. The key technical challenge we overcome is that the number of supply units at any node can never be negative. Simulation results in a realistic ridehailing environment support our theoretical findings.",0,1,0

"Understanding the performance gap: a machine learning approach on residential buildings in Turin, Italy
Buildings account for the highest share of primary energy usage and greenhouse gas emission in the E.U. and U.S. [1], and most of this energy is used for space and water heating. Being able to gain a broader understanding of the gap between predicted and in situ measured thermal performance of buildings may, in a lot of cases, help reducing the energy consumption and, therefore, alleviating our pressure on the environment [2]. The aim of this research is to further investigate this performance gap and to evaluate the possibility of using machine learning algorithms to effectively predict the energy demand of buildings. For this purpose, a group of residential buildings in the city of Turin, Italy, is taken as case study: an estimation of their yearly heating demand is made using different machine learning algorithms, and their results are evaluated and discussed. The research showed that the use of machine learning resulted in a performance gap in line, if not lower, with the current literature. The reasons for this outcome, as well as possible future research directions are finally discussed.",0,1,1
"Residential solar photovoltaic adoption behaviour: End-to-end review of theories, methods and approaches
Abstract The effectiveness of deployment policies to promote the uptake of residential rooftop solar photovoltaic systems ultimately hinges on the behaviour of households who decide to accept or reject the technology. Over the past years, research has strived to understand, designate significant predictors, model the behaviour of heterogeneous households, and predict the diffusion rate by putting a wide range of approaches in place. Inspired by compiling a comprehensive database of home solar adoption studies, the present study systematically reviews the adopted theories, methods and approaches used within 199 original quantitative, qualitative, statistical, and non-statistical articles covering households’ attitudes, awareness, tendencies, knowledge, motives, willingness, intentions, and adoption decisions. The study provides a critical analysis of investigations on the adoption of solar photovoltaics, solar home systems, and solar photovoltaics coupled with battery energy storage systems. The outcome of the review revealed 108 future and 91 retroactive studies that exploit 10 key dependent variables by means of 52% primary (empirical data), 34% secondary (available sources), and 13% covering both modes of data collection. The sensitivity of these dependent variables was tested by 36 intervention variables that seek to capacitate effective managerial policies. The complexity of the individual decision was comprehended by 13 forms of behavioural theories, with the top-ranked two being the diffusion of innovation and the theory of planned behaviour. The literature showcased a total of 170 quantitative, 20 qualitative, and nine mixed-method studies, with statistical and non-statistical techniques being applied 139 and 86 times, respectively. Regression analysis was the most commonly used statistical analysis method, followed by spatial analysis for non-statistical models. At the heart of the predictive methods for analysing the diffusion rate of these solar technologies, nuances of 25 agent-based models and their social networks were examined in depth. The review further revealed 14 spectra of household categories as well as 12 typologies of household comparisons.",0,1,1

"Stakeholder dynamics in residential solar energy adoption: findings from focus group discussions in Germany
Although there is a clear indication that stages of residential decision making are characterized by their own stakeholders, activities, and outcomes, many studies on residential low-carbon technology adoption only implicitly address stage-specific dynamics. This paper explores stakeholder influences on residential photovoltaic adoption from a procedural perspective, so-called stakeholder dynamics. The major objective is the understanding of underlying mechanisms to better exploit the potential for residential photovoltaic uptake. Four focus groups have been conducted in close collaboration with the independent institute for social science research SINUS Marktund Sozialforschung in East Germany. By applying a qualitative content analysis, major influence dynamics within three decision stages are synthesized with the help of egocentric network maps from the perspective of residential decision-makers. Results indicate that actors closest in terms of emotional and spatial proximity such as members of the social network represent the major influence on residential PV decision-making throughout the stages. Furthermore, decision-makers with a higher level of knowledge are more likely to move on to the subsequent stage. A shift from passive exposure to proactive search takes place through the process, but this shift is less pronounced among risk-averse decision-makers who continuously request proactive influences. The discussions revealed largely unexploited potential regarding the stakeholders local utilities and local governments who are perceived as independent, trustworthy and credible stakeholders. Public stakeholders must fulfill their responsibility in achieving climate goals by advising, assisting, and financing services for low-carbon technology adoption at the local level. Supporting community initiatives through political frameworks appears to be another promising step.",0,1,0

"A small-signal graphene-FET equivalent circuit considering an explicit contribution of contact resistances
A small-signal equivalent circuit for graphene field-effect transistors is proposed considering the explicit contribution of effects at the metal-graphene interfaces by means of contact resistances. A methodology to separate the contact resistances from extrinsic parameters, obtained by a de-embedding process, and intrinsic parameters of the circuit is considered. The experimental high-frequency performance of two different GFET technologies is properly described by the proposed small-signal circuit.

"Fast Probabilistic Hosting Capacity Analysis for Active Distribution Systems
Interconnection studies for distributed energy resources (DERs) can currently take months since they entail simulating a large number of power flow scenarios. If DERs are to be actively controlled, probabilistic hosting capacity analysis (PHCA) studies become more time-consuming since they require solving multiple optimal power flow (OPF) tasks. PHCA is expedited here by leveraging the powerful tool of multiparametric programming (MPP). Using an approximate grid model, optimal DER setpoints are decided by a quadratic program, which depends on analysis and uncertain parameters in a possibly nonlinear fashion. By reformulating this program, feasible and infeasible OPF instances alike are handled in a unified way to uniquely reveal the location, frequency, and severity of feeder constraint violations. The effect of voltage regulators is also captured by novel approximate models. Upon properly extending MPP to PHCA, we were able to find the exact minimizers for 518,400 OPF instances on the IEEE 123-bus feeder by solving only 6,905 of them, and 86,400 instances on a 1,160-bus feeder by solving only 2,111 instances. This accelerated PHCA by a factor of 10. Thus, a utility can promptly infer grid statistics using real-world data without a probabilistic characterization of uncertain parameters.",1,1,1
"Adaptive pseudo-rigid-body model for generalized cross-spring pivots under combined loads
Generalized cross-spring pivots (CSPs) are widely used as revolute joints in precision machinery. However, pseudo-rigid-body (PRB) models cannot capture the parasitic motions of a generalized CSP exactly under combined loads; moreover, the characteristic parameters used in PRB methods must be recomputed using optimization techniques. In this study, we develop two simple and accurate PRB models for generalized CSPs. First, a PRB method for a beam is developed based on the beam constraint model and the instantaneous center model, where the beam is modeled as two rigid links joined at a pivot via a torsion spring. Subsequently, two PRB models of the generalized CSP, comprising a four-bar model for accuracy and a pin-joint model for stiffness, are constructed based on a kinematic analysis using the proposed PRB method. A deflection characteristic analysis is then conducted to determine the relationship between the proposed model and the existing models. Finally, the PRB models for the pivot under the action of combined loads are validated via finite element analysis. The error evaluation indicates that the proposed PRB models are more accurate than the results from existing methods. The PRB models proposed here can be used in parametric design of compliant mechanisms.",0,0,1

"On the virtues and vices of combining theories: the case of institutional and actor-network theories in accounting research
This paper examines the possibilities and challenges of combining method theories in accounting research through an analysis of studies which combine insights from institutional theory (IT) and actor-network theory (ANT). We investigate the paradigmatic challenges associated with combining these method theories and whether and how scholars have dealt with such challenges. We demonstrate how the combination of these method theories in a single study gives rise to considerable paradigmatic tensions. The most significant tensions relate to the two method theories' diverging ontological conceptions of the nature of social structures and agency and their very different epistemological views of the role of theory. Moreover, our review of extant accounting research combining IT and ANT indicates that a large number of studies simply ignore such tensions and do not provide deeper reflections on the paradigmatic implications of combining these method theories. Whilst recognizing the substantive contributions emerging from this body of research, we question whether continued rapprochement between IT and ANT is the most appropriate way forward and suggest alternative theoretical paths for examining the institutionalization of accounting. We also call on accounting researchers to exercise much greater reflexivity regarding the paradigmatic implications of combining method theories as well as the more general justifiability of such practices as a vehicle for advancing our understanding of accounting as a social and organizational practice.",0,0,0
"Hybrid physics-based and data-driven modeling with calibrated uncertainty for lithium-ion battery degradation diagnosis and prognosis
Advancing lithium-ion batteries (LIBs) in both design and usage is key to pro-moting electriﬁcation in the coming decades to mitigate human-caused climate change. Inadequate understanding of LIB degradation is an important bottleneck that limits battery durability and safety. Here, we propose hybrid physics-based and data-driven modeling for online diagnosis and prognosis of battery degradation. Compared to existing battery modeling efforts, we aim to build a model with physics as its backbone and statistical learning techniques as enhancements. Such a hybrid model has better generalizability and interpretability together with a well-calibrated uncertainty associated with its prediction, rendering it more valuable and relevant to safety-critical applications under realistic usage scenarios.",0,1,1
"Time-of-Flight Characterization of Electrospray Thrusters Using Porous Emitters with High Emission Currents
An electrospray thruster designed for nanosatellites is introduced in this paper. The thruster has a compact size featuring a passive propellant transport method through the use of porous materials. Porous electrospray emitters with 1, 25 and 100 emission tips were fabricated using conventional machining techniques. The geometrical features of the emission tips were analysed based on the measurement using a high-precision laser profilometer. Thruster prototypes fitted with different emitters were tested in a bipolar operation mode. The emission currents and voltage characteristics were studied, which demonstrated a wide range of operational voltage with relatively high emission currents. The maximum overall emission currents were +3.22 mA and -4.72 mA achieved at ±3500 V, and the maximum emission current per emission tip was +93.2 `A and -100.8 `A at +3067 and -3118 V, respectively. Time-of-flight systems were utilised to characterise the mass and velocity distribution of the charged particles in the thruster plume. The results suggested that the electrospray emission were highly ionic with mostly monomer and dimer ions present. The thruster performance was conservatively estimated, with the thrust ranging from approximately 1 `N to 204 `N, and the specific impulse ranging from 3000 s to approximately 6000 s.",0,1,1
"Using data mining for bank direct marketing: an application of the CRISP-DM methodology
The increasingly vast number of marketing campaigns over time has reduced its effect on the general public. Furthermore, economical pressures and competition has led marketing managers to invest on directed campaigns with a strict and rigorous selection of contacts. Such direct campaigns can be enhanced through the use of Business Intelligence (BI) and Data Mining (DM) techniques. This paper describes an implementation of a DM project based on the CRISP-DM methodology. Real-world data were collected from a Portuguese marketing campaign related with bank deposit subscription. The business goal is to find a model that can explain success of a contact, i.e. if the client subscribes the deposit. Such model can increase campaign efficiency by identifying the main characteristics that affect success, helping in a better management of the available resources (e.g. human effort, phone calls, time) and selection of a high quality and affordable set of potential buying customers.",0,1,0
"Anthropomorphically Inspired Design of a Tendon-Driven Robotic Prosthesis for Hand Impairments
ANTHROPOMOPRPHICALLY INSPIRED DESIGN OF A TENDON-DRIVEN ROBOTIC PROSTHESIS FOR HAND IMPAIRMENTS Manali Bapurao Bhadugale Old Dominion University, 2018 Director: Dr. Krishnanand Kaipa This thesis presents the design of a robotic prosthesis, which mimics the morphology of a human hand. The primary goal of this work is to develop a systematic methodology that allows a custom-build of the prosthesis to match the specific requirements of a person with hand impairments. Two principal research questions are addressed toward this goal: 1) How do we cater to the large variation in the distribution of overall hand-sizes in the human population? 2) How closely do we mimic the complex morphological aspects of a biological hand in order to maximize the anthropomorphism (human-like appearance) of the robotic hand, while still maintaining a customizable and manageable design? This design approach attempts to replicate the crucial morphological aspects in the artificial hand (the kinematic structure of the hand skeleton, the shape and aspect ratios of various bone-segments, and ranges of motion). The hand design is partitioned into two parts: 1) A stiff skeleton structure, comprising parametrically synthesized segments that are simplified counterparts of nineteen bone-segments—five metacarpals, five proximal phalanges, four middle phalanges, and five distal phalanges—of the natural hand-skeleton and simplified mechanical substitutes of the remaining eight carpal bones. 2) A soft skin-like structure that encompasses the artificial skeleton to match the cosmetics and compliant features of the natural hand. A parameterized CAD model representation of each synthesized segment is developed by using the feature of design-tables in SolidWorks, which allows easy customization with respect to each person. Average hand measurements available in the literature are used to guide the dimensioning of parameters of each synthesized segment. Tendon-driven actuation of the fingers allows the servo actuators to be mounted remotely, thereby enabling a sleek finger design. A prototype of the robotic hand is constructed by 3D-printing all the parts using an Object 30 Prime 3D printer. Results reported from physical validation experiments of the robotic hand demonstrate the feasibility of the proposed design approach.",0,0,1
"Classification of artificial intelligence technologies to determine the civil liability
The paper confirms a conclusion that there is no unified approach to the issue of civil liability for the actions of artificial intelligence. The authors propose to consider fault-based liability, liability regardless of fault and liability founded on a risk-based approach. To determine a type of liability for the actions of AI, the authors outline a classification of AI technologies on four grounds: autonomy, self-learning, feature and availability of data recorders. According to the authors, the most promising approach to the legal regulation of liability for the functioning of artificial intelligence technologies is a risk-based approach.

"Phishing in Organizations: Findings from a Large-Scale and Long-Term Study
In this paper, we present findings from a largescale and long-term phishing experiment that we conducted in collaboration with a partner company. Our experiment ran for 15 months during which time more than 14,000 study participants (employees of the company) received different simulated phishing emails in their normal working context. We also deployed a reporting button to the company’s email client which allowed the participants to report suspicious emails they received. We measured click rates for phishing emails, dangerous actions such as submitting credentials, and reported suspicious emails. The results of our experiment provide three types of contributions. First, some of our findings support previous literature with improved ecological validity. One example of such results is good effectiveness of warnings on emails. Second, some of our results contradict prior literature and common industry practices. Surprisingly, we find that embedded training during simulated phishing exercises, as commonly deployed in the industry today, does not make employees more resilient to phishing, but instead it can have unexpected side effects that can make employees even more susceptible to phishing. And third, we report new findings. In particular, we are the first to demonstrate that using the employees as a collective phishing detection mechanism is practical in large organizations. Our results show that such crowd-sourcing allows fast detection of new phishing campaigns, the operational load for the organization is acceptable, and the employees remain active over long periods of time.",0,1,0
"Validating Gravity-Based Market Share Models Using Large-Scale Transactional Data
Customer patronage behavior has been widely studied in market share modeling contexts, which is an essential step toward estimating retail sales and finding new store locations in a competitive setting. Existing studies have conducted surveys to estimate merchants' market share and factors of attractiveness to use in various proposed mathematical models. Recent trends in Big Data analysis allow us to better understand human behavior and decision making, potentially leading to location models with more realistic assumptions. In this article, we propose a novel approach for validating the Huff gravity market share model, using a large-scale transactional dataset that describes customer patronage behavior at a regional level. Although the Huff model has been well studied and widely used in the context of sales estimation, competitive facility location, and demand allocation, this article is the first in validating the Huff model with a real dataset. Our approach helps to easily apply the model in different regions and with different merchant categories. Experimental results show that the Huff model fits well when modeling customer shopping behavior for a number of shopping categories, including grocery stores, clothing stores, gas stations, and restaurants. We also conduct regression analysis to show that certain features such as gender diversity and marital status diversity lead to stronger validation of the Huff model. We believe we provide strong evidence, with the help of real-world data, that gravity-based market share models are viable assumptions for retail sales estimation and competitive facility location models.",0,1,0
"MIMO stream selection based on antenna layout and channel scenario
An antenna selections method that achieves the improvement of channel capacity has been proposed. The conventional method selects suitable antennas from all combinations so that the channel capacity is maximized. In the conventional method, a signal is always transmitted and received at all antennas and then it is difficult to save the power consumption. In order to solve the problem, this paper proposes a MIMO stream selection. Since the channel capacity depends on azimuth spread, AoD (Angle of Departure), AoA (Angle of Arrival), the proposed method varies the number of streams according to a channel scenario. The proposed system can decreases the power consumption due to limitations on used antennas.",0,1,0
"An entrepreneurial learning approach to assessment of internships

Purpose
The purpose of this paper is to investigate how using an entrepreneurial learning approach for assessment of internships could increase the reflected value of combining theory and practice articulated in students’ learning outcomes. Furthermore, the purpose was to investigate whether the applied approach led to enhanced perception of professional identity and new understandings of employability for students in the internship course.


Design/methodology/approach
A qualitative research design was the basis for investigation of the topics in focus. The data consisted of five focus groups, observation notes, and documentation from the exam situations. Two consecutive groups of students (2015 and 2016) participated in the study at a university of applied science in Denmark.


Findings
Results from the study provided evidence that students in internships collectively develop a comprehensive understanding of how to apply theory to practical settings. By working with an entrepreneurial learning approach in the professional practice, students reported an enhanced reflective understanding of learning outcomes and the theory-practice gap, developed an ability for opportunity identification, and established a grounded feeling of professional identity and employability.


Practical implications
The current pilot project serves as a full and context-rich case study that can inform educators about formative and summative assessment practices when designing internships courses. Furthermore, internship supervisors can get valuable insight into learning processes during an internship.


Originality/value
The suggested model for an entrepreneurial learning approach to assessment of internships provides a basis for further research within entrepreneurial learning and the application to design of assessment practices in this context.

"High fidelity modelling and simulation of inertial sensors commonly used by autonomous mobile robots
Autonomous mobile robot behaviors are notoriously difficult to predict using simulations. Robot behaviors are driven by the robot’s sensor systems, and sensor outputs need to be produced in simulations at near-truth levels. However, in order to achieve real-time or faster performance, most simulation environments use empircal, effects-based sensor models, and these simplified models do not provide sensor outputs at the level of fidelity necessary to develop and test autonomy algorithms. Simulated sensor outputs must accurately reflect not only the sensor’s intrinsic noise and signal processing effects but also the sensor’s interaction with its external environment. To address this need for physics-based sensor models, models of the Global Positioning System (GPS), micro electro-mechanical (MEMS) accelerometer, and MEMS gyroscope sensors were developed using a first-principles, physics-based methodology. These sensor models run in near realtime on high performance computering (HPC) assets. The sensors were simulated for a test site located in Vicksburg, MS, and the simulated sensor outputs were compared to truth data collected using a Garmin hand held GPS unit and low cost 6 DOF commercial inertial measurement unit (IMU) consisting of three orthogonal MEMS accelerometers and 3 orthogonal MEMS gyroscopes. The sensor models were also used as part of a simulated autonomous unmanned ground vehicle reconnaissance mission, and results from this simulation are presented.",0,0,1

High throughput satellites employing multibeam antennas and full frequency reuse for broadband satellite services are considered in this paper. Such architectures offer, for example, a cost-effective solution to optimize data delivery and extend the coverage areas in future 5G networks. We propose the application of the multiple-input-multiple-output (MIMO) technology in both the feeder link and the multiuser downlink. Spatial multiplexing of different data streams is performed in a common feeder beam. In the user links, MIMO with multiple beams is exploited to simultaneously serve different users in the same frequency channel. Under particular design constraints, effective spatial separation of the multiple user signals is possible. To mitigate the inter-stream interference in the MIMO feeder link as well as the multiuser downlink, precoding of the transmit signals is applied. Simulation results illustrate the performance gains in terms of sum throughput.",1,1,0
"Investigating the Relationship between Multi-Party Linguistic Entrainment, Team Characteristics and the Perception of Team Social Outcomes
Multi-party linguistic entrainment refers to the phenomenon that speakers tend to speak more similarly during conversation. We first developed new measures of multi-party entrainment on features describing linguistic style, and then examined the relationship between entrainment and team characteristics in terms of gender composition, team size, and diversity. Next, we predicted the perception of team social outcomes using multi-party linguistic entrainment and team characteristics with a hierarchical regression model. We found that teams with greater gender diversity had higher minimum convergence than teams with less gender diversity. Entrainment contributed significantly to predicting perceived team social outcomes both alone and controlling for team characteristics.",0,0,0
"Ventilated acoustic metamaterial window panels for simultaneous noise shielding and air circulation
Abstract The conflict between the acoustical performance and ventilation efficiency in conventional noise barriers limits their application potentials in several settings. To address this challenge, we design and experimentally demonstrate a ventilated tunable acoustic metamaterial for noise mitigation at targeted frequencies. Through the structure, a peak normal incidence sound absorption coefficient of more than 0.96 at 1000 Hz and the peak normal incidence sound transmission loss of 18 dB is achieved while maintaining the air circulation with a 45% open area of ventilation. Such a high absorption near the resonant frequency under the ventilation condition originates from high impedance matching between the metastructure and air. Next, we present a proof-of-concept for the fabrication of acoustic metapanels for large scale applications. A simple jigsaw puzzle-like assembly technique is used to interconnect the multiple unit cells, leading to the production of integrated metapanels. The experimental findings validate the potential applications of the proposed metapanels for low-to-mid frequency noise control in a small ventilated spaces.",0,0,1
"Design and characterization of a low cost mems IMU cluster for precision navigation
DESIGN AND CHARACTERIZATION OF A LOW COST MEMS IMU CLUSTER FOR PRECISION NAVIGATION Daniel R. Greenheck, B.Sc. Marquette University, 2015 The fast paced development of micro-electromechanical systems (MEMS) technology in recent years has resulted in the availability of low cost gyroscopes and accelerometers in commercial markets. These sensors can be integrated into a single device known as an inertial measurement unit (IMU). An IMU is capable of tracking and navigating a vehicle for a short period of time in the absence of external position and attitude updates. The precision of the manufacturing techniques used to fabricate commercial MEMS sensors as well as their mechanical nature result in noise and errors that limit their performance. It has been mathematically shown that combining many MEMS sensors into a single device results in improved performance characteristics which are unattainable using a single MEMS sensor. The primary aim of this thesis is to design and validate the performance of a prototype IMU composed of a cluster of individual MEMS IMUs. The secondary aim of this thesis is to derive and validate a set of computationally inexpensive coning and sculling algorithms to mitigate dead-reckoning errors resulting from high frequency motion of the vehicle.",0,0,1

Abstract This work proposes an efficient and effective method to design the fixed feedback controller directly on active noise cancellation headphones by using the measured frequency response of the secondary path. The designed controller comprises several biquad filters whose parameters can be solved by a two-stage optimization strategy composed of the genetic algorithm and the simplex method. The construction of the loss function for this optimization follows the traditional H 2 / H ∞ method, which takes noise reduction, waterbed effect, and robustness all into consideration. Simulation and experimental results show that the controller optimized by the proposed method can achieve good noise reduction performance with acceptable waterbed lifting while ensuring robustness to plant variations.",0,0,1
"Forecasting the Spread of Covid-19 Under Control Scenarios Using LSTM and Dynamic Behavioral Models
To accurately predict the regional spread of Covid-19 infection, this study proposes a novel hybrid model which combines a Long short-term memory (LSTM) artificial recurrent neural network with dynamic behavioral models. Several factors and control strategies affect the virus spread, and the uncertainty arisen from confounding variables underlying the spread of the Covid-19 infection is substantial. The proposed model considers the effect of multiple factors to enhance the accuracy in predicting the number of cases and deaths across the top ten most-affected countries and Australia. The results show that the proposed model closely replicates test data. It not only provides accurate predictions but also estimates the daily behavior of the system under uncertainty. The hybrid model outperforms the LSTM model accounting for limited available data. The parameters of the hybrid models were optimized using a genetic algorithm for each country to improve the prediction power while considering regional properties. Since the proposed model can accurately predict Covid-19 spread under consideration of containment policies, is capable of being used for policy assessment, planning and decision-making.",0,0,0
"Enhancement of Coded Speech Using a Mask-Based Post-Filter
The quality of speech codecs deteriorates at low bitrates due to high quantization noise. A post-filter is generally employed to enhance the quality of the coded speech.

Affordances are key attributes of what must be perceived by an autonomous robotic agent in order to effectively interact with novel objects. Historically, the concept derives from the literature in psychology and cognitive science, where affordances are discussed in a way that makes it hard for the definition to be directly transferred to computational specifications useful for robots.

"Distributed Motion Coordination Using Convex Feasible Set Based Model Predictive Control
The implementation of optimization-based motion coordination approaches in real world multi-agent systems remains challenging due to their high computational complexity and potential deadlocks. This paper presents a distributed model predictive control (MPC) approach based on convex feasible set (CFS) algorithm for multi-vehicle motion coordination in autonomous driving. By using CFS to convexify the collision avoidance constraints, collision-free trajectories can be computed in real time. We analyze the potential deadlocks and show that a deadlock can be resolved by changing vehicles’ desired speeds. The MPC structure ensures that our algorithm is robust to low-level tracking errors. The proposed distributed method has been tested in multiple challenging multi-vehicle environments, including unstructured road, intersection, crossing, platoon formation, merging, and overtaking scenarios. The numerical results and comparison with other approaches (including a centralized MPC and reciprocal velocity obstacles) show that the proposed method is computationally efficient and robust, and avoids deadlocks.",0,0,1

"The sceptical Bayes factor for the assessment of replication success
Replication studies are increasingly conducted but there is no established statistical criterion for replication success. We propose a novel approach combining reverse‐Bayes analysis with Bayesian hypothesis testing: a sceptical prior is determined for the effect size such that the original finding is no longer convincing in terms of a Bayes factor. This prior is then contrasted to an advocacy prior (the reference posterior of the effect size based on the original study), and replication success is declared if the replication data favour the advocacy over the sceptical prior at a higher level than the original data favoured the sceptical prior over the null hypothesis. The sceptical Bayes factor is the highest level where replication success can be declared. A comparison to existing methods reveals that the sceptical Bayes factor combines several notions of replicability: it ensures that both studies show sufficient evidence against the null and penalises incompatibility of their effect estimates. Analysis of asymptotic properties and error rates, as well as case studies from the Social Sciences Replication Project show the advantages of the method for the assessment of replicability.",0,0,0
"Evolving Continuous Optimisers from Scratch
This work uses genetic programming to explore the space of continuous optimisers, with the goal of discovering novel ways of doing optimisation. In order to keep the search space broad, the optimisers are evolved from scratch using Push, a Turing-complete, general-purpose, language. The resulting optimisers are found to be diverse, and explore their optimisation landscapes using a variety of interesting, and sometimes unusual, strategies. Significantly, when applied to problems that were not seen during training, many of the evolved optimisers generalise well, and often outperform existing optimisers. This supports the idea that novel and effective forms of optimisation can be discovered in an automated manner. This paper also shows that pools of evolved optimisers can be hybridised to further increase their generality, leading to optimisers that perform robustly over a broad variety of problem types and sizes.",1,1,0

"A Global Modeling Approach for Load Forecasting in Distribution Networks
—Efﬁcient load forecasting is needed to ensure better observability in the distribution networks, whereas such forecasting is made possible by an increasing number of smart meter installations. Because distribution networks include a large amount of different loads at various aggregation levels, such as individual consumers, transformer stations and feeders loads, it is impractical to develop individual (or so-called local) forecasting models for each load separately. Furthermore, such local models ignore the strong dependencies between different loads that might be present due to their spatial proximity and the characteristics of the distribution network. To address these issues, this paper proposes a global modeling approach based on deep learning for efﬁcient forecasting of a large number of loads in distribution networks. In this way, the computational burden of training a large amount of local forecasting models can be largely reduced, and the cross-series information shared among different loads can be utilized. Additionally, an unsupervised localization mechanism and optimal ensemble construction strategy are also proposed to localize/personalize the forecasting model to different groups of loads and to improve the forecasting accuracy further. Comprehensive experiments are conducted on real-world smart meter data to demonstrate the superiority of the proposed approach compared to competing methods.",0,0,1
"How to Evaluate Trading Strategies: Single Agent Market Replay or Multiple Agent Interactive Simulation?
We show how a multi-agent simulator can support two important but distinct methods for assessing a trading strategy: Market Replay and Interactive Agent-Based Simulation (IABS). Our solution is important because each method offers strengths and weaknesses that expose or conceal flaws in the subject strategy. A key weakness of Market Replay is that the simulated market does not substantially adapt to or respond to the presence of the experimental strategy. IABS methods provide an artificial market for the experimental strategy using a population of background trading agents. Because the background agents attend to market conditions and current price as part of their strategy, the overall market is responsive to the presence of the experimental strategy. Even so, IABS methods have their own weaknesses, primarily that it is unclear if the market environment they provide is realistic. We describe our approach in detail, and illustrate its use in an example application: The evaluation of market impact for various size orders.",0,1,0
"Day-ahead electricity price prediction applying hybrid models of LSTM-based deep learning methods and feature selection algorithms under consideration of market coupling
Abstract The availability of accurate day-ahead electricity price forecasts is pivotal for electricity market participants. In the context of trade liberalisation and market harmonisation in the European markets, accurate price forecasting becomes difficult for electricity market participants to obtain because electricity forecasting requires the consideration of features from ever-growing coupling markets. This study provides a method of exploring the influence of market coupling on electricity price prediction. We apply state-of-the-art long short-term memory (LSTM) deep neural networks combined with feature selection algorithms for electricity price prediction under the consideration of market coupling. LSTM models have a good performance in handling nonlinear and complex problems and processing time series data. In our empirical study of the Nordic market, the proposed models obtain considerably accurate results. The results show that feature selection is essential to achieving accurate prediction, and features from integrated markets have an impact on prediction. The feature importance analysis implies that the German market has a salient role in the price generation of Nord Pool.",0,0,1

A convolution neural network (CNN) based classification method for broadband DOA estimation is proposed, where the phase component of the short-time Fourier transform coefficients of the received microphone signals are directly fed into the CNN and the features required for DOA estimation are learned during training. Since only the phase component of the input is used, the CNN can be trained with synthesized noise signals, thereby making the preparation of the training data set easier compared to using speech signals. Through experimental evaluation, the ability of the proposed noise trained CNN framework to generalize to speech sources is demonstrated. In addition, the robustness of the system to noise, small perturbations in microphone positions, as well as its ability to adapt to different acoustic conditions is investigated using experiments with simulated and real data.",0,1,1
"Contribution of the transverse arch to foot stiffness in humans
Stiffness of the human foot is central to its mechanical function, such as elastic energy storage and propulsion. Its doubly-arched structure, manifested as longitudinal and transverse arches, is thought to underlie the stiff nature. However, previous studies have focused solely on the longitudinal arch, and little is known about whether and how the transverse arch impacts the foot's stiffness. The common observation that a flexible currency bill significantly stiffens upon curling it transversally underlies our hypothesis that the transverse arch dominates the foot's stiffness. Through human subject experiments, we show that transversally reinforcing the ball of the foot by means of sports tape can increase the midfoot bending (dorsiflexion) stiffness by 53% on average. Such a result is possible if and only if midfoot bending is mechanically coupled with splaying of the distal metatarsal heads, thus engaging the distal transverse ligament. Using a simplified foot model, we elucidate a mechanism for such coupling to arise because of the transverse arch; namely transverse curvature couples sagittal plane bending with stretching along the transverse direction. We therefore conclude that the previously ignored distal metatarsal transverse ligaments, by way of the transverse arch, likely underlie the midfoot's elastic response by an amount comparable to or surpassing the plantar fascia, the windlass mechanism and other longitudinal tissues. Our findings impact current practice in clinical, sports and evolutionary biomechanics that focus solely on the longitudinal arch and on two-dimensional sagittal plane mechanics.",0,1,1

"Reward-penalty mechanism in a closed-loop supply chain with sequential manufacturers' price competition
This paper examines reward-penalty mechanism (RPM) for a closed-loop supply chain (CLSC) with two sequential competing manufacturers. Game theoretic models are developed to investigate both cases: no RPM in the CLSC, and RPM with government is implemented in the CLSC. Equilibrium Nash solutions are obtained and the conditions under which RPM is effective are investigated. Results indicate that: (i) RPM lowers the wholesale price and the retail price, while it boosts the sales quantity, profits of the manufacturers, the retailer, and the total profit of CLSC as well as the collection rate. (ii) The collection rate of the follower manufacturer enhances with the incremental substitute coefficient, whereas it does not have effect on the leader manufacturer. (iii) All participants in the CLSC will make ever-increasing profits only when products' substitute coefficient is lower than certain values. Additionally, RPM keeps the market competitive order since it protects the wholesale price of the leader's market leading status.",0,0,0

"Multi-objective Optimal Sizing and Energy Management of Hybrid Energy Storage System for Electric Vehicles
Hybrid energy storage system (HESS) composed of lithium-ion battery and supercapacitors has been recognized as one of the most promising solutions to face against the high cost, low power density and short cycle life of the battery-only energy storage system, which is the major headache hindering the further penetration of electric vehicles. In this work, the HESS sizing and energy management problem of an electric race car is investigated as a case study to improve the driving mileage and battery cycle life performance. Compared with the existing research, the distinctive features of this work are: (1) A dynamic model and a degradation model of the battery are employed to describe the dynamic behavior and to predict the cycle life of the battery more precisely; (2) Considering the fact that the design and control problems are coupled in most cases, in order to achieve a global optimal design solution and an implementable real-time energy management system, a Bi-level multi-objective sizing and control framework based on non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm-II and fuzzy logic control (FLC) is proposed to size the HESS and to optimize the membership functions of a FLC based EMS at the same time; (3) In order to improve the optimization efficiency, a vectorized fuzzy inference system which allows large scale of fuzzy logic controllers operating in parallel is devised. At last, the Pareto optimal solutions of different HESSs are obtained and compared to show the achieved enhancements of the proposed Bi-level optimal sizing and energy management framework.",0,1,1
"Active learning strategy for high fidelity short-term data-driven building energy forecasting
Abstract The quality of a data-driven model is heavily dependent on the quality of data. Data from building operation often have data bias problems, which means that the data sample is collected in a way that some members of the intended data population are less likely to be included than others. Data-driven energy forecasting models built on such data hence are biased and could lead to large forecasting errors. Active learning— an effective method to defying data bias—is rarely studied or applied in the area of data-driven building energy forecasting modeling. This paper attempts to fill this gap and explores the application of active learning in data-driven building energy forecasting. The developed strategy in this paper efficiently generate informative training data within a time budget and uses block design to passively consider weather disturbances. The developed active learning strategy is applied and evaluated in both virtual and real-building testbeds against traditional data-driven methods. Via these virtual and real-building evaluation cases, we have demonstrated that the data bias problem typically exists in building operation data is resolved by applying the developed active learning strategy. Building energy forecasting models trained from data generated from the active learning strategy have shown improved performances in both model accuracy and model extendibility perspectives. The effectiveness of the block design module is also validated to effectively consider the impact of weather conditions on active learning design.",0,1,1

"A Wearable Detector for Simultaneous Finger Joint Motion Measurement
This paper presents a wearable and stretchable detector for simultaneous finger joint motion measurement, providing the feasible technical solutions to solve the problems existing in the current devices. The sensor array installed in the detector consists of 14 custom-made bending sensors and an inertial measurement unit with high accuracy. The glove support for a sensor array, which is made of three silicone materials with different elasticity, not only overcomes the drawbacks of cloth support, but also addresses the compatibility between the stretch substrate and the inelastic sensing components. Besides, two-section electrical connection avoids the problems caused by the external wires in traditional solutions to enhance the durability of glove. The experiment results indicated that the wearable detector offers a good user experience by exerting a small force on fingers.

"An origami-inspired, self-locking robotic arm that can be folded flat
A self-locking foldable mechanism enables a robotic arm to be folded flat and to maintain high stiffness when deployed. A foldable arm is one of the practical applications of folding. It can help mobile robots and unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) overcome access issues by allowing them to reach into confined spaces. The origami-inspired design enables a foldable structure to be lightweight, compact, and scalable while maintaining its kinematic behavior. However, the lack of structural stiffness has been a major limitation in the practical use of origami-inspired designs. Resolving this obstacle without losing the inherent advantages of origami is a challenge. We propose a solution by implementing a simple stiffening mechanism that uses an origami principle of perpendicular folding. The simplicity of the stiffening mechanism enables an actuation system to drive shape and stiffness changes with only a single electric motor. Our results show that this design was effective for a foldable arm and allowed a UAV to perform a variety of tasks in a confined space.",0,0,1

"Nanosheet field effect transistors-A next generation device to keep Moore's law alive: An intensive study
Abstract Incessant downscaling of feature size of multi-gate devices such as FinFETs and gate-all-around (GAA) nanowire (NW)-FETs leads to unadorned effects like short channel effects (SCEs) and self-heating effects (SHEs) which limits their performance and causes reliability issues. FinFET technology has resulted in a remarkable performance up to a feature size of 7 nm. The research community is expecting that GAA NW-FETs will take over FinFET technology from 7 nm to 5 nm. However, further shrinking of feature size to 3 nm will impose severe challenges to the performance of these aforesaid multi-gate devices. Subsequently, the electron device designer community needs to look for alternative device designs like nanosheet FETs (NS-FETs) to overcome the limitations of the FinFET and GAA NW-FETs technologies. The driving force behind the emergence of these NS-FETs is their ability to scale down even below a feature size of 5 nm with negligible short channel effects. Therefore, in this review article we have intensively investigated the NS-FETs in terms of impact of geometrical scaling, substrate material effects, parasitic channel effects, thermal effects, compatibility with different metal gates, and source/drain (S/D) metal depth effect. Consequently, it can be concluded that vertically stacked NS-FET is the most promising solution for future digital/analog integrated circuit applications due to their outstanding capability to keep Moore's Law alive.",0,0,1

"Buildings-to-Grid Integration Framework
This paper puts forth a mathematical framework for Buildings-to-Grid (BtG) integration in smart cities. The framework explicitly couples power grid and building’s control actions and operational decisions, and can be utilized by buildings and power grids operators to simultaneously optimize their performance. Simplified dynamics of building clusters and building-integrated power networks with algebraic equations are presented---both operating at different time-scales. A model predictive control (MPC)-based algorithm that formulates the BtG integration and accounts for the time-scale discrepancy is developed. The formulation captures dynamic and algebraic power flow constraints of power networks and is shown to be numerically advantageous. The paper analytically establishes that the BtG integration yields a reduced total system cost in comparison with decoupled designs where grid and building operators determine their controls separately. The developed framework is tested on standard power networks that include thousands of buildings modeled using industrial data. Case studies demonstrate building energy savings and significant frequency regulation, while these findings carry over in network simulations with nonlinear power flows and mismatch in building model parameters. Finally, simulations indicate that the performance does not significantly worsen when there is uncertainty in the forecasted weather and base load conditions.",0,0,1

It is analyzed that disturbed rotor dynamics during yaw maneuvering lead towards the existence of oscillations and hamper the efficiency of attitude system. We have categorically signified the situation where remote controller of attitude system cannot prevent flipping and consequently, shortens the life of QUAV. This type of situation arises in a strong wind friction zone where positive drag force of rotor dynamics is impeded by the magnitude of rotational moment of inertia. Moreover, subcritical and zero-Hopf bifurcations aroused due to retardational effect in attitude system are analyzed with the aid of normal form and averaging theory.

"Spectral Efficiency and BER of OFDM Systems with Carrier Frequency Offset (CFO)
Orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) is a parallel transmission method, where single data stream is separated into a number of lower rate subcarriers, and each carrier is orthogonal to all other carriers. One of the main problems for OFDM system is Carrier frequency offset (CFO). OFDM is sensitive to CFO, which spoils the orthogonality between the sub-carriers, and cause Inter-carrier interference (ICI) in the OFDM, which corrupts the overall performance of OFDM and creates the frequency difference between the local oscillators of the transmitter and receiver, and the signals transmitted on each carrier are not independent of each other. In this paper, we introduce the analysis for calculating the Spectral Efficiency of OFDM systems with CFO. We further present the bit error rate (BER) performance of OFDM system with various CFOs under additive white gaussian noise (AWGN). This paper presents, the CFO in OFDM and the analysis for calculating the effect of the various CFOs on the performance of the OFDM system in term of BER under AWGN.

"Hybrid Beamforming With a Reduced Number of Phase Shifters for Massive MIMO Systems
In this paper, two novel hybrid beamforming methods are proposed to reduce the cost and power consumption of hybrid beamformers with a subconnected phase shifter network structure in massive multiple–input multiple–output systems. This is achieved by replacing some of the phase shifters with switches, which, in general, are cheaper and have lower power consumption compared to phase shifters. The proposed methods and the closed-form expressions of their performance are derived according to the properties of the elements of the singular vectors of the channel matrix. In the first approach, it is shown that by combining the subconnected phase shifter network with a fully connected switch architecture, the number of the phase shifters can be reduced up to 50%, while the spectral efficiency is preserved. Then, in order to simplify the structure of the switch network, the fully connected switches are replaced by a subconnected switch network, e.g., binary switches. The analytical and simulation results indicate that just by using 25% of phase shifters, 90% spectral efficiency can be achieved. Finally, simulation results indicate that a similar behavior is observed when the wireless channel is considered to be sparse or correlated.",0,0,1
"A vibration energy harvesting device with bidirectional resonance frequency tunability
Vibration energy harvesting is an attractive technique for potential powering of wireless sensors and low power devices. While the technique can be employed to harvest energy from vibrations and vibrating structures, a general requirement independent of the energy transfer mechanism is that the vibration energy harvesting device operate in resonance at the excitation frequency. Most energy harvesting devices developed to date are single resonance frequency based, and while recent efforts have been made to broaden the frequency range of energy harvesting devices, what is lacking is a robust tunable energy harvesting technique. In this paper, the design and testing of a resonance frequency tunable energy harvesting device using a magnetic force technique is presented. This technique enabled resonance tuning to ± 20% of the untuned resonant frequency. In particular, this magnetic-based approach enables either an increase or decrease in the tuned resonant frequency. A piezoelectric cantilever beam with a natural frequency of 26 Hz is used as the energy harvesting cantilever, which is successfully tuned over a frequency range of 22–32 Hz to enable a continuous power output 240–280 µW over the entire frequency range tested. A theoretical model using variable damping is presented, whose results agree closely with the experimental results. The magnetic force applied for resonance frequency tuning and its effect on damping and load resistance have been experimentally determined.",0,0,1
"Ventilation mode performance against airborne respiratory infections in small office spaces: limits and rational improvements for Covid-19
The Coronavirus disease (Covid-19), caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus, has produced significant social and economic disruptions in different countries. Current evidence suggests a strong correlation between the infection and the cohabitation of indoor spaces. International organizations and experts consider that the airborne transmission through aerosols can occur in specific conditions and that inadequate ventilation increases the risk of infection. As a result, the increase in ventilation rates and air filtration efficiencies are recommended for public buildings in the context of Covid-19, with significant impacts on energy consumption, and a paradigm shift in the design of ventilation systems is necessary for this new context. Therefore, this study has assessed the comparative performance of the displacement ventilation and the mixed ventilation mode on reducing the risk of long-range airborne infection for the Covid-19 in a small office application. A coupled multizone-CFD (Computational Fluid Dynamics) software developed by the National Institute of Standards and Technology was used in this study to assess the relative performance of several design solutions related to different ventilation modes, filter efficiencies, and outdoor air flow rates.

"Electricity Tariff Design via Lens of Energy Justice
Distributed Energy Resources (DERs) can significantly affect the net social benefit in power systems, raising concerns pertaining to distributive justice, equity, and fairness. Electricity tariff and DERs share a symbiotic relationship whereby the design of the former directly impacts the economic efficiency and equity in the system. Current tariff design approaches suffer from opaque efficiency-equity trade-offs and are also agnostic of the externalities that affect both economic efficiency and equity. Therefore, this paper develops a justice-cognizant tariff design framework that improves the economic efficiency of tariff without sacrificing its distributional equity, and encompasses economic welfare, social costs of environmental and public health impacts, and socio-economic and demographic characteristics of electricity consumers. The proposed framework is based on a Single Leader Single Follower (SLSF) game incorporating a multi-objective optimization problem, and is evaluated on four different tariff structures. The SLSF game is reformulated as a Multi-Objective Problem with Equilibrium Constraints (MOPEC) and is solved by integrating the objective sum method for multi-objective optimization and Scholtes’s relaxation technique for equilibrium constraints. We compare the economic efficiency and equity of the proposed framework using the 11-zone New York ISO and 7-bus Manhattan power networks. The results demonstrate that spatiallyand temporally-granular tariffs ensure equity and economic efficiency at a lower energy burden to consumers. NOMENCLATURE A.

"Effect of placement of piezoelectric material and proof mass on the performance of piezoelectric energy harvester
Abstract This paper presents the effect of placement of piezoelectric material over the length of a cantilever beam based energy harvester. The effect of the material, volume, shape, size and placement of the proof mass were also analysed using COMSOL Multiphysics 5.3a. The distance between the piezoelectric material and the fixed end was varied over the length of the beam. Maximum power was produced, while the piezoelectric material was placed near to the fixed end. The resonant frequency of the beam is decreased, when the distance between the piezoelectric material and the fixed end is increased. The resonant frequency of the energy harvester and the voltage output at various conditions were numerically and experimentally verified. From the numerical analysis, it was found that the material and volume of the proof mass does not have any significant effect on the power output and resonant frequency of the beam. The size of the proof mass has 1.9% and 0.8% effect on the power output and resonant frequency of the beam respectively. The placement of the proof mass has a 10.9% effect on the resonant frequency of the beam and shape of the proof mass has 1.9% effect on the power output.",0,0,1
"High-precision, resistor less gas pressure sensor and instrumentation amplifier in CNT technology
Abstract In this paper, a new high-precision, pressure sensor for sensing gas molecules using a controllable voltage-mode instrumentation amplifier (VMIA) in carbon nanotube field-effect transistor (CNTFET) technology is designed. The sensing mechanism is based on the applied force by Oxygen atoms on the surface of the carbon nanotube (CNT), which is considered as a movable electrode of sensing capacitor. The sensing mechanism is simulated in ANSYS which justifies the variations of sensing capacitance, while the sensor’s output voltage is applied to an accurate instrumentation amplifier (IA) via a switched-capacitor sensor driver. Therefore, due to the controllability of the transconductance and gain parameters of a CNTFET, the IA circuit provides a constant and controllable differential gain of up to 52 dB in a flat −3dB bandwidth of up to 3.6 MHz, which provides a tunable common-mode rejection ratio (CMRR) of up to 121 dB in a 1.8 GHz flat, −3dB frequency bandwidth. Moreover, due to the use of the differential pair stage, the total harmonic distortion (THD) value is obtained less than 0.67%. Finally, the proposed IA circuit consumes only 45.1 µW with a 22.52 nV/√Hz equivalent input referred noise value at ±0.5 V supply.",0,1,1
"Deep Learning for Multifidelity Aerodynamic Distribution Modeling from Experimental and Simulation Data
The wind-tunnel experiment plays a critical role in the design and development phases of modern aircraft, which is limited by prohibitive cost. In contrast, numerical simulation, as an important alternative paradigm, mimics complex flow behaviors but is less accurate compared to experiment. This leads to the recent development and emerging interest in applying data fusion for aerodynamic prediction. In particular, the accurate prediction of aerodynamic with lower computational cost can be achieved by fusing experimental (high-fidelity) and computational (low-fidelity) aerodynamic data. Currently, existing works on aerodynamic model using data fusion mainly concern integral data (lift, drag, etc.). In this paper, a multifidelity aerodynamic model based on Deep Neural Network (DNN), where both numerical and experimental data are introduced in the loss function with proper weighting factor to balance the overall accuracy, is developed for aerodynamic distribution over the wing surface. Specially, the proposed approach is illustrated by modeling the surface pressure distribution of ONERA M6 wing in transonic flow, including different secnarios where the flow condition varies or there is less high-fidelity data. The results demonstrate that the proposed approach with decent number of low-fidelity data and a few high-fidelity data can accurately predict the surface pressure distribution on transonic wing. The outperformance of the proposed model over other DNNs from only high-fidelity or low-fidelity, has been reported.",0,1,1
"Deep Learning for Intelligent Demand Response and Smart Grids: A Comprehensive Survey
Electricity is one of the mandatory commodities for mankind today. To address challenges and issues in the transmission of electricity through the traditional grid, the concepts of smart grids and demand response have been developed. In such systems, a large amount of data is generated daily from various sources such as power generation (e.g., wind turbines), transmission and distribution (microgrids and fault detectors), load management (smart meters and smart electric appliances). Thanks to recent advancements in big data and computing technologies, Deep Learning (DL) can be leveraged to learn the patterns from the generated data and predict the demand for electricity and peak hours. Motivated by the advantages of deep learning in smart grids, this paper sets to provide a comprehensive survey on the application of DL for intelligent smart grids and demand response. Firstly, we present the fundamental of DL, smart grids, demand response, and the motivation behind the use of DL. Secondly, we review the state-ofthe-art applications of DL in smart grids and demand response, including electric load forecasting, state estimation, energy theft detection, energy sharing and trading. Furthermore, we illustrate the practicality of DL via various use cases and projects. Finally, we highlight the challenges presented in existing research works and highlight important issues and potential directions in the use of DL for smart grids and demand response.",0,0,1
"Deep Neural Net with Attention for Multi-channel Multi-touch Attribution
Customers are usually exposed to online digital advertisement channels, such as email marketing, display advertising, paid search engine marketing, along their way to purchase or subscribe products( aka. conversion). The marketers track all the customer journey data and try to measure the effectiveness of each advertising channel. The inference about the influence of each channel plays an important role in budget allocation and inventory pricing decisions. Several simplistic rule-based strategies and data-driven algorithmic strategies have been widely used in marketing field, but they do not address the issues, such as channel interaction, time dependency, user characteristics. In this paper, we propose a novel attribution algorithm based on deep learning to assess the impact of each advertising channel. We present Deep Neural Net With Attention multi-touch attribution model (DNAMTA) model in a supervised learning fashion of predicting if a series of events leads to conversion, and it leads us to have a deep understanding of the dynamic interaction effects between media channels. DNAMTA also incorporates user-context information, such as user demographics and behavior, as control variables to reduce the estimation biases of media effects. We used computational experiment of large real world marketing dataset to demonstrate that our proposed model is superior to existing methods in both conversion prediction and media channel influence evaluation.",0,1,0
"RISE controller tuning and system identification through machine learning for human lower limb rehabilitation via neuromuscular electrical stimulation
Neuromuscular electrical stimulation (NMES) has been eﬀectively applied in many rehabilitation treatments of individuals with spinal cord injury (SCI). In this context, we introduce a novel, robust, and intelligent control-based methodology to closed-loop NMES systems. Our approach utilizes a robust control law to guarantee system stability and machine learning tools to optimize both the controller parameters and system identiﬁcation. Regarding the latter, we introduce the use of past rehabilitation data to build more realistic data-driven identiﬁed models. Furthermore, we apply the proposed methodology for the rehabilitation of lower limbs using a control technique named the robust integral of the sign of the error (RISE), an oﬄine improved genetic algorithm optimizer, and neural network models. Although in the literature, the RISE controller presented good results on healthy subjects, without any ﬁne-tuning method, a trial and error approach would quickly lead to muscle fatigue for individuals with SCI. In this paper, for the ﬁrst time, the RISE controller is evaluated with two paraplegic subjects in one stimulation session and with seven healthy individuals in at least two and at most ﬁve sessions. The results showed that the proposed approach provided a better control performance than empirical tuning, which can avoid premature fatigue on NMES-based clinical procedures.",0,1,1

"Characterizing Lifting and Lowering Activities with Insole FSR sensors in Industrial Exoskeletons
This paper presents an insole FSR (Force Sensing Resistor) to dynamically detect weight variations in an exoskeleton system. The proposed methodology is intended for tasks of lifting and lowering heavy weights with an industrial exoskeleton to substantially reduce spinal loads during these manual handling activities. Instead of extensively placing high-dense force sensors by covering the whole plantar area, as most of commercial applications do, we integrate only a few force sensors in specific plantar area, so that the sensory system is not restricted to an individual foot size and shape, and on the other hand has relatively lower material cost. Industrial exoskeletons are intended to assist workers when handling heavy goods. With this in mind, wearers are not able to use their hands to control the exoskeleton since they use them to handle the goods. Therefore, the exoskeleton controller is required to indirectly infer how much and when the wearer requires assistance for lifting or lowering a heavy weight. Our approach of dynamically detect and characterize the increment/decrement of weight, as well as the rising/falling edge, enables the exoskeleton's controller to trigger the request of assistive force to the actuators.",0,1,1
"Discovering Object-centric Petri Nets
Techniques to discover Petri nets from event data assume precisely one case identifier per event. These case identifiers are used to correlate events, and the resulting discovered Petri net aims to describe the life-cycle of individual cases. In reality, there is not one possible case notion, but multiple intertwined case notions. For example, events may refer to mixtures of orders, items, packages, customers, and products. A package may refer to multiple items, multiple products, one order, and one customer. Therefore, we need to assume that each event refers to a collection of objects, each having a type (instead of a single case identifier). Such object-centric event logs are closer to data in real-life information systems. From an object-centric event log, we want to discover an object-centric Petri net with places that correspond to object types and transitions that may consume and produce collections of objects of different types. Object-centric Petri nets visualize the complex relationships among objects from different types. This paper discusses a novel process discovery approach implemented in PM4Py. As will be demonstrated, it is indeed feasible to discover holistic process models that can be used to drill-down into specific viewpoints if needed.",0,0,0
"Determining Microservice Boundaries: A Case Study Using Static and Dynamic Software Analysis
A number of approaches have been proposed to identify service boundaries when decomposing a monolith to microservices. However, only a few use systematic methods and have been demonstrated with replicable empirical studies. 
We describe a systematic approach for refactoring systems to microservice architectures that uses static analysis to determine the system's structure and dynamic analysis to understand its actual behavior. A prototype of a tool was built using this approach (MonoBreaker) and was used to conduct a case study on a real-world software project. 
The goal was to assess the feasibility and benefits of a systematic approach to decomposition that combines static and dynamic analysis. The three study participants regarded as positive the decomposition proposed by our tool, and considered that it showed improvements over approaches that rely only on static analysis.",0,1,0
"Classification of bearing faults through time-frequency analysis and image processing
The present work proposes a new technique for bearing fault classification that combines time-frequency analysis with image processing. This technique uses vibration signals from bearing housings to detect bearing conditions and classify the faults. The signals are decomposed by means of Empirical Mode Decomposition (EMD) and Principal Components Analysis (PCA) in order to obtain the principal components that characterize the original signal. The spectrogram is calculated for each component by means of the Short Time Fourier Transform (STFT) to obtain an image that represents the time-frequency relationship of the main components of the analyzed signal. Furthermore, Image Moments are extracted from the spectrogram images of principal components in order to get an array of features for each signal that can be handled by the classification algorithm. Finally, the classification is performed using a standard machine learning technique, i.e. Support Vector Machine (SVM), in the proposed technique. The dataset used in this work include data collected for various rotating speeds and loads, in order to obtain a set of different operating conditions, by a Roller Bearing Faults Simulator. The results have shown that the developed technique provides classification effectively, with a single classifier, of bearing faults characterized by different rotating speeds and different loads.",0,0,1
"The Characterization of Fading Channels by Bernard Sklar
When the mechanisms that cause fading in communication channels were first modeled in the 1950s and 1960s, the principles developed were primarily applied to over-the-horizon communications covering a wide range of frequency bands. The 3-30 MHz high-frequency (HF) band used for ionospheric propagation, as well as the 300 MHz-3 GHz ultra-high-frequency (UHF) and the 3-30 GHz superhigh-frequency (SHF) bands used for tropospheric scatter, are examples of channels that are affected by fading phenomena. Although the fading effects in mobile radio channels are somewhat different from those encountered in ionospheric and tropospheric channels, the early models are still quite useful in helping to characterize the fading effects in mobile digital communication systems. This article emphasizes so-called Rayleigh fading, primarily in the UHF band, which affects mobile systems such as cellular and personal communication systems (PCS). The primary goal is to characterize the fading channel and in so doing to describe the fundamental fading manifestations and types of degradation.",0,1,0
"Landing and Perching on Vertical Surfaces with Microspines for Small Unmanned Air Vehicles
We present the first results of a system that allows small fixed-wing UAVs to land and cling on surfaces such as brick walls using arrays of microspines that engage asperities on the surface. The requirements of engaging and loading the spines lead to an approach in which an open-loop pitch-up motion is triggered by a range sensor as the plane nears the wall. The subsequent dynamics result in a period during which the plane stays within an envelope of acceptable orientation and velocity (pitch from 60–105 deg, vertical velocity from 0 to − 2.7 m/s and up to 3 m/s of horizontal velocity) that permit successful perching. At touchdown, a non-linear suspension absorbs the remaining kinetic energy to minimize peak forces, prevents bouncing and facilitates spine engagement. The total maneuver duration is less than 1 s. We describe the spine suspension and its analysis and present results of typical perching maneuvers (10 landings under autonomous control and 20 under manual control). Under calm conditions, the success rate for autonomous perching on building walls is approximately 80%, the failures being attributed to erroneous wall detection. We conclude with a discussion of future work to increase the robustness of the approach (e.g. with wind) and allow subsequent take-offs to resume flight.",0,0,1

"Accelerometric Method for Cuffless Continuous Blood Pressure Measurement
Pulse transit time (PTT) has been widely used for cuffless blood pressure (BP) measurement. But, it requires more than one cardiovascular signals involving more than one sensing device. In this paper, we propose a method for continuous cuffless blood pressure measurement with the help of left ventricular ejection time (LVET). The LVET is estimated using a signal obtained through a micro-electromechanical system (MEMS)-based accelerometric sensor. The sensor acquires a seismocardiogram (SCG) signal at the chest surface, and the LVET information is extracted. Both systolic blood pressure (SBP) and diastolic blood pressure (DBP) are estimated by calibrating the system with the original arterial blood pressure values of the subjects. The proposed method is evaluated using different quantitative measures on the signals collected from ten subjects under the supine position. The performance of the proposed method is also compared with two earlier approaches, where PTT intervals are estimated from electrocardiogram (ECG)-photoplethysmogram (PPG) and SCG-PPG, respectively. The performance results clearly show that the proposed method is comparable with the state-of-the-art methods. Also, the computed blood pressure is compared with the original one, measured through a CNAP system. It gives the mean errors of the estimated systolic BP and diastolic BP within the range of -0.19 +/- 3.3 mmHg and -1.29 +/- 2.6 mmHg, respectively. The mean absolute errors for systolic BP and diastolic BP are 3.2 mmHg and 2.6 mmHg, respectively. The accuracy of BPs estimated from the proposed method satisfies the requirements of the IEEE standard of 5 +/- 8 mmHg deviation, and thus, it may be used for ubiquitous long term blood pressure monitoring.",1,1,1
"Modern antennas and microwave circuits : a complete master-level course
Modern antenna systems include passive antenna structures, passive microwave circuits and interconnections to electronics. Therefore, the antenna engineer should have a deep understanding of antenna theory and should be able to apply microwave engineering concepts. This textbook provides all relevant material for Master-level courses in the domain of antenna systems. The book includes comprehensive material on antennas and provides introduction-level material on microwave engineering, which is the perfect mixture to educate junior antenna experts. The theoretical material in this textbook can be supplemented by labs in which the students learn how to use state-of-the-art antenna and microwave design tools and test equipment, such as a vector network analyzer or a near-field scanner. Several chapters in this book can be used quite independent from each other. For example, chapter 6 can be used in a dedicated phased-array antenna course without the need to use Maxwell-based antenna theory from chapter 4. Similarly, chapter 3 on transmission lines and microwave circuits does not require deep back-ground knowledge in electromagnetics or antenna theory.",0,0,0

"A Study on the Prevalence of Human Values in Software Engineering Publications, 2015 - 2018
Failure to account for human values in software (e.g., equality and fairness) can result in user dissatisfaction and negative socioeconomic impact. Engineering these values in software, however, requires technical and methodological support throughout the development life cycle. This paper investigates to what extent top Software Engineering (SE) conferences and journals have included research on human values in SE. We investigate the prevalence of human values in recent (2015 - 2018) publications in these top venues. We classify these publications, based on their relevance to different values, against a widely used value structure adopted from the social sciences. Our results show that: (a) only a small proportion of the publications directly consider values, classified as directly relevant publications; (b) for the majority of the values, very few or no directly relevant publications were found; and (c) the prevalence of directly relevant publications was higher in SE conferences compared to SE journals. This paper shares these and other insights that may motivate future research on human values in software engineering.",0,1,0
"UX Research on Conversational Human-AI Interaction: A Literature Review of the ACM Digital Library
Early conversational agents (CAs) focused on dyadic human-AI interaction between humans and the CAs, followed by the increasing popularity of polyadic human-AI interaction, in which CAs are designed to mediate human-human interactions. CAs for polyadic interactions are unique because they encompass hybrid social interactions, i.e., human-CA, human-to-human, and human-to-group behaviors. However, research on polyadic CAs is scattered across different fields, making it challenging to identify, compare, and accumulate existing knowledge. To promote the future design of CA systems, we conducted a literature review of ACM publications and identified a set of works that conducted UX (user experience) research. We qualitatively synthesized the effects of polyadic CAs into four aspects of human-human interactions, i.e., communication, engagement, connection, and relationship maintenance. Through a mixed-method analysis of the selected polyadic and dyadic CA studies, we developed a suite of evaluation measurements on the effects. Our findings show that designing with social boundaries, such as privacy, disclosure, and identification, is crucial for ethical polyadic CAs. Future research should also advance usability testing methods and trust-building guidelines for conversational AI.",0,1,0
"Neural-Network-Based Contouring Control for Robotic Manipulators in Operational Space
This brief presents a contouring control scheme for robotic manipulators. The geometric properties of the desired contour are incorporated in the controller design phase, and the resulting controller has been structured as a two-layered hierarchical control scheme that consists of an outer loop and an inner loop. The outer loop is formed by kinematic control system in operational space, which can be designed to assign different dynamics to the tangential, normal, and binormal direction of the desired contour. It is shown that the outer loop can provide a joint velocity reference signal to the inner one. The inner loop is used to implement a velocity servo control system at the robot joint level. Meanwhile, a radial basis function network is adopted to compensate for the nonlinear dynamics of the robotic manipulator, where a robust control strategy is used to suppress the modeling error of neural networks. Experimental results on the Zebra-Zero robotic manipulator have demonstrated the effectiveness of the proposed control scheme in comparison with other control strategies.",0,1,1

"Analyst Underreaction and the Post‐Forecast Revision Drift
The post‐forecast revision drift (PFRD), the phenomenon of delayed stock price reactions to analyst forecast revisions, is a well‐documented market anomaly. Prior research attributes PFRD to underreaction by investors to analyst forecast revisions. This study investigates the role of the analyst forecast revision process itself in the PFRD anomaly. Using a large sample of US firms, we confirm prior findings of a positive serial correlation (momentum) in individual analysts’ revisions to their earnings forecasts and, based on both indirect and direct tests, document a positive association between this momentum and PFRD. Further analyses reveal that both the forecast revision momentum and PFRD vary in similar ways with respect to the nature of the news driving the revisions and the information environment. Collectively, our findings show that underreaction by individual analysts in the forecast revision process is an important contributor to the PFRD phenomenon.",0,1,0
"Critically analysing the concept of workplace flexibility and how it impacts employee and organizational performance: A case of the retail industry in India

"A Multimodal, Enveloping Soft Gripper: Shape Conformation, Bioinspired Adhesion, and Expansion-Driven Suction
A key challenge in robotics is to create efficient methods for grasping objects with diverse shapes, sizes, poses, and properties. Grasping with hand-like end effectors often requires careful selection of hand orientation and finger placement. Here, we present a fingerless soft gripper capable of efficiently generating multiple grasping modes. It is based on a soft, cylindrical accordion structure containing coupled, parallel fluidic channels, which are controlled via pressure supplied from a single fluidic port. Inflation opens the gripper orifice for enveloping an object, while deflation allows it to produce grasping forces. The interior is patterned with a gecko-like skin that increases friction, enabling the gripper to lift objects weighing up to 20 N. Our design ensures that fragile objects, such as eggs, can be safely handled, by virtue of a wall buckling mechanism. In reverse, the gripper can be deflated to reach into an opening or orifice then inflated to grasp objects with handles or cavities. The gripper may also integrate a lip that enables it to form a seal and, upon inflating, to generate suction for lifting objects with flat surfaces. In this article, we describe the design and fabrication of this device and present an analytical model of its behavior when operated from a single fluidic port. In experiments, we demonstrate its ability to grasp diverse objects, and show that its performance is well described by our model. Our findings show how a fingerless soft gripper can efficiently perform a variety of grasping operations. Such devices could improve the ability of robotic systems to meet applications in areas of great economic and societal importance.",0,0,1

"Automotive Radar Interference Mitigation Using Adaptive Noise Canceller
Interference among frequency modulated continues wave automotive radars can either increase the noise floor, which occurs in the most cases, or generate a ghost target in rare situations. To address the increment of noise floor due to interference, we proposed a low calculation cost method using adaptive noise canceller to increase the signal-to-interference ratio. In a quadrature receiver, the interference in the positive half of frequency spectrum is correlated to that in the negative half of frequency spectrum, whereas the beat frequencies from real targets are always present in the positive frequency. Thus, we estimated the power of the negative frequency as an indication of interference, and fed the positive frequency and negative frequency components into the primary and reference channel of an adaptive noise canceller, respectively. The least mean square algorithm was used to solve for the optimum filter solution. As a result, both the simulation and experiment showed a good interference mitigation performance.",1,1,1
"Massive MIMO: An Introduction
Demand for wireless throughput, both mobile and fixed, will always increase. One can anticipate that, in five or ten years, millions of augmented reality users in a large city will want to transmit and receive 3D personal high-definition video more or less continuously, say 100 megabits per second per user in each direction. Massive MIMO-also called Large-Scale Antenna Systems-is a promising candidate technology for meeting this demand. Fifty-fold or greater spectral efficiency improvements over fourth generation (4G) technology are frequently mentioned. A multiplicity of physically small, individually controlled antennas performs aggressive multiplexing/demultiplexing for all active users, utilizing directly measured channel characteristics. Unlike today's Point-to-Point MIMO, by leveraging time-division duplexing (TDD), Massive MIMO is scalable to any desired degree with respect to the number of service antennas. Adding more antennas is always beneficial for increased throughput, reduced radiated power, uniformly great service everywhere in the cell, and greater simplicity in signal processing. Massive MIMO is a brand new technology that has yet to be reduced to practice. Notwithstanding, its principles of operation are well understood, and surprisingly simple to elucidate.",0,1,0
"Soft Actor-Critic Deep Reinforcement Learning for Fault Tolerant Flight Control
Fault-tolerant flight control faces challenges, as developing a model-based controller for each unexpected failure is unrealistic, and online learning methods can handle limited system complexity due to their low sample efficiency.

"Theory for diffusive and ballistic air leakage and its application to suction cups
We have developed a theory of air leakage at interfaces between two elastic solids with application to suction cups in contact with randomly rough surfaces. We present an equation for the airflow in narrow constrictions which interpolate between the diffusive and ballistic (Knudsen) air-flow limits. To test the theory we performed experiments using two different suction cups, made from soft polyvinylchloride (PVC), in contact with sandblasted polymethylmethacrylate (PMMA) plates. We found that the measured time to detatch (lifetime) of suction cups were in good agreement with theory, except for surfaces with the root-mean-square (rms) roughness below $\approx 1 \ {\rm \mu m}$, where diffusion of plasticizer from the PVC to the PMMA surface caused blockage of critical constrictions. Suction cup volume, stiffness and elastic modulus have a huge influence on the air leakage and hence the failure time of the cups. Based on our research we propose an improved biomimetic design of suction cups, that could show improved failure times in varying degree of roughness under dry and wet environments.",0,0,1
"A framework for fake review detection in online consumer electronics retailers
Abstract The impact of online reviews on businesses has grown significantly during last years, being crucial to determine business success in a wide array of sectors, ranging from restaurants, hotels to e-commerce. Unfortunately, some users use unethical means to improve their online reputation by writing fake reviews of their businesses or competitors. Previous research has addressed fake review detection in a number of domains, such as product or business reviews in restaurants and hotels. However, in spite of its economical interest, the domain of consumer electronics businesses has not yet been thoroughly studied.

"Synchronous Islanded Operation of a Diesel Generator
The amount of distributed generation connected to the distribution network is increasing. To use this resource more effectively, splitting of the distribution network, or islanding the system, for prevention of power outages is being considered by some utilities. In this paper an islanding method that avoids out-of-synchronism re-closure is proposed. The island is kept in synchronism with the rest of the utility while it is not electrically connected. This is referred to as synchronous islanded operation. A phase difference control algorithm, developed by the authors, was tested in a single set scenario on a 50-kVA diesel generator using two different governors. These are the ldquostandard productrdquo variable gain governor of the diesel generator and a governor developed by the authors, which utilizes supplementary inputs in addition to engine speed. The results show that phase difference can be controlled within acceptable limits, both in steady state and after load disturbances are applied.

"Agrivoltaic Farm Design: Vertical Bifacial vs. Tilted Monofacial Photovoltaic Panels
An unprecedented demand for Food, Energy, and Water (FEW) over coming decades require integrated FEW innovations with least environmental footprint. Collocating solar photovoltaic (PV) technology with agriculture is a promising approach towards dual land productivity that could locally fulfil growing food and energy demands. This 'agrivoltaic' (AV) solution can be highly suitable for hot and arid climates where an optimized solar panel coverage could prevent excessive thermal stress thereby increasing the crop yield and lowering the water budget. One of the concerns with using standard fixed tilt solar array structure that faces north/south (N/S) direction for AV farming is the spatial heterogeneity in the daily sunlight distribution for crops and soil water contents, both of which could affect crop yield. Dynamic tilt control through a tracking system can eliminate this problem but could increase the system cost and complexity. Here, we investigate east/west (E/W) faced vertical bifacial panel structure for AV farming and show that this could provide a much better spatial homogeneity for daily sunlight distribution relative to the fixed tilt N/S faced PV structure implying a better suitability for monoculture cropping. By modeling PV energy and crop yield under varying density (row to row pitch) for PV arrays and shade tolerances for crops, we show that E/W vertical bifacial panels can provide ~5% better land productivity as compared to N/S faced fixed tilt panels for Lahore (31.520N, 74.358E) when PV array density is slightly lower than that of a standard solar farm. In contrast, when PV arrays are denser than the standard, land productivity for E/W vertical bifacial panels degrades due to mutual shading. These results, together with high inherent resilience to soiling (dust accumulation) losses for E/W vertical bifacial panels, indicate their attractive prospects for AV applications.",0,0,1

The system utilized a two-step strategy, based on short-time Fourier transform and Hilbert transform, the wideband chirp excitation signal was employed to analyze the BIS first, from which the sensitive bandwidth, i.e., the frequency range in which the amplitude (and phase angle) of the object changes rapidly, is obtained. Then, the discrete frequency points among the sensitive bandwidth were selected to compose a multisinusoidal signal for impedance tomography with time-difference and frequency-difference (FD) methods. An impedance model was tested to evaluate the performance of BIS analysis. Experiments on phantoms consisting of carrot cylinder and nylon rod were designed to verify the working strategy of the system. The results indicated that the developed system can distinguish the objects and reconstruct medium distribution with high image contrast and frequency resolution. Compared with the traditional multifrequency EIT, the proposed method and system show advantages in imaging the local electrical properties with high-frequency resolution and obtaining the FD images in the sensitive BIS bandwidth.",0,1,1

"Seeding as Part of the Marketing Mix: Word-of-Mouth Program Interactions for Fast-Moving Consumer Goods
Seeded marketing campaigns (SMCs) have become part of the marketing mix for many fast-moving consumer goods (FMCG) companies. In addition to making large investments in advertising and sales promotions, these firms now encourage seed agents or microinfluencers to discuss brands with friends and acquaintances to create further value. It is thus critical to understand how an FMCG seeding program interacts with traditional marketing tools when estimating the effectiveness of such efforts. However, the issue is still underexplored. The authors present the first empirical analysis of this question using a rich data set collected on four brands from various European FMCG markets. They combine advertising and sales promotion data from FMCG brand managers with sales and retail variables from market research companies as well as firm-created word-of-mouth variables from SMC agencies. The authors analyze the data using several approaches, confronting challenges of endogeneity and multicollinearity. They consistently find that firm-created word of mouth through SMC programs interacts negatively with all tested forms of advertising but positively with promotional activities. This phenomenon has significant implications for understanding the utility of SMCs and how they should be managed. The analysis implies that SMCs may increase total sales by approximately 3%–18% throughout the campaigns.",0,1,0
"What Makes People Join Conspiracy Communities?: Role of Social Factors in Conspiracy Engagement
Widespread conspiracy theories, like those motivating anti-vaccination attitudes or climate change denial, propel collective action and bear society-wide consequences. Yet, empirical research has largely studied conspiracy theory adoption as an individual pursuit, rather than as a socially mediated process. What makes users join communities endorsing and spreading conspiracy theories? We leverage longitudinal data from 56 conspiracy communities on Reddit to compare individual and social factors determining which users join the communities. Using a quasi-experimental approach, we first identify 30K future conspiracists-(FC) and 30K matched non-conspiracists-(NC). We then provide empirical evidence of importance of social factors across six dimensions relative to the individual factors by analyzing 6 million Reddit comments and posts. Specifically in social factors, we find that dyadic interactions with members of the conspiracy communities and marginalization outside of the conspiracy communities, are the most important social precursors to conspiracy joining-even outperforming individual factor baselines. Our results offer quantitative backing to understand social processes and echo chamber effects in conspiratorial engagement, with important implications for democratic institutions and online communities.",0,1,0
"Combining Safe Interval Path Planning and Constrained Path Following Control: Preliminary Results
We study the navigation problem for a robot moving amidst static and dynamic obstacles and rely on a hierarchical approach to solve it. First, the reference trajectory is planned by the safe interval path planning algorithm that is capable of handling any-angle translations and rotations. Second, the path following problem is treated as the constrained control problem and the original flatness-based approach is proposed to generate control. We suggest a few enhancements for the path planning algorithm aimed at finding trajectories that are more likely to be followed by a robot without collisions. Results of the conducted experimental evaluation show that the number of successfully solved navigation instances significantly increases when using the suggested techniques.",1,1,0
"Learning Torque Control for Quadrupedal Locomotion
—Reinforcement learning (RL) is a promising tool for developing controllers for quadrupedal locomotion. The design of most learning-based controllers adopts the joint position-based paradigm, wherein a low-frequency RL policy outputs target joint positions that are then tracked by a high- frequency proportional-derivative (PD) controller that outputs joint torques. However, the low frequency of such a policy hin- ders the advancement of highly dynamic behaviors. Moreover, determining the PD gains for optimal tracking performance is laborious and dependent on the task at hand. In this paper, we introduce a learning torque control framework, which trains an RL policy that directly predicts joint torques at a high frequency, thus circumventing the use of PD controllers. We validate the proposed framework with extensive experiments where the quadruped is able to both traverse various terrains and resist external pushes, given user-specified commands. To our knowledge, this is the first attempt of learning torque control for quadrupedal locomotion with an end-to-end single neural network that has led to successful real-world experi- ments among recent research on learned quadrupedal locomotion which is mostly position-based.",0,1,1

"Lane-change-aware connected automated vehicle trajectory optimization at a signalized intersection with multi-lane roads
Abstract Trajectory smoothing is an effective concept to control connected automated vehicles (CAVs) in mixed traffic to reduce traffic oscillations and improve overall traffic performance. However, smoother trajectories often lead to greater gaps between vehicles, which may incentivize human driven vehicles (HVs) from adjacent lanes to make cut-in lane changes. Such cut-in lane changes may compromise the expected performance from CAV trajectory smoothing. To figure out the reasons behind the issue, this paper designs a mixed traffic framework at a signalized intersection with multi-lane roads considering detailed trajectory control, car following and lane changing maneuvers all together. Based on the framework, this paper proposes a decentralized lane-change-aware CAV trajectory optimization model including discretionary lane change restraining and mandatory lane change yielding strategies. Riding comfort and traffic mobility are considered as a joint objective. And the complex non-linear lane-change-aware constraints are linearized to convert the proposed problem to a quadratic optimization problem. The linearization allows the investigated problem to be easily fed into a commercial solver. Numerical experiments are conducted to study the performance of the proposed model and to compare it with other models (e.g., a cooperative lane change model and a trajectory optimization model without the lane-change-aware mechanism) in different scenarios. First, results show that the HV lane changes cause reduction of half or more expected benefits of trajectory smoothing along a multi-lane segment adjacent to a signalized intersection. Then, we find that the proposed model outperforms the other models. Especially, the proposed model yields extra benefits in the system joint objective (10–25%), riding comfort (10–25%), travel time (1–8%), fuel consumption (3–15%) and safety (5–25%) compared with the trajectory optimization model without the lane-change-aware mechanism when CAV market penetration rate is not high. Sensitivity analyses on road segment lengths, signal cycle lengths, traffic saturation rates and through-vehicle rates show that the proposed model yields better system performance under most scenarios, e.g., 20% extra benefit at a short road segment length, 30% extra benefit at a long signal cycle length, 25% extra benefit at a high traffic saturation rate, and 25% extra benefit at a high through-vehicle rate.",0,0,1

"Viewpoint: Human-in-the-loop Artificial Intelligence
Little by little, newspapers are revealing the bright future that Artificial Intelligence (AI) is building. Intelligent machines will help everywhere. However, this bright future may have a possible dark side: a dramatic job market contraction before its unpredictable transformation. Hence, in a near future, large numbers of job seekers may need financial support while catching up with these novel unpredictable jobs. This possible job market crisis has an antidote inside. In fact, the rise of AI is sustained by the biggest knowledge theft of the recent years. Many learning AI machines are extracting knowledge from unaware skilled or unskilled workers by analyzing their interactions. By passionately doing their jobs, many of these workers are shooting themselves in the feet. 
In this paper, we propose Human-in-the-loop Artificial Intelligence (HitAI) as a fairer paradigm for AI systems. Recognizing that any AI system has humans in the loop, HitAI will reward these aware and unaware knowledge producers with a different scheme: decisions of AI systems generating revenues will repay the legitimate owners of the knowledge used for taking those decisions. As modern Merry Men, HitAI researchers should fight for a fairer Robin Hood Artificial Intelligence that gives back what it steals.

"Optimal Triangulation Method is Not Really Optimal
Triangulation refers to the problem of finding a 3D point from its 2D projections on multiple camera images. For solving this problem, it is the common practice to use so-called optimal triangulation method, which we call the L2 method in this paper. But, the method can be optimal only if we assume no uncertainty in the camera parameters. Through extensive comparison on synthetic and real data, we observed that the L2 method is actually not the best choice when there is uncertainty in the camera parameters. Interestingly, it can be observed that the simple midpoint method outperforms other methods. Apart from its high performance, the mid-point method has a simple closed formed solution for multiple camera images while the L2 method is hard to be used for more than two camera images. Therefore, in contrast to the common practice, we argue that the simple mid-point method should be used in structure-from-motion applications where there is uncertainty in camera parameters. SM.

The forced oscillations produced by the exciting emf. will be comparatively small. The free oscillations caused by any normal variations in tube operation will also be small.

"Bridging Analytical Methods for Release and Stability Testing Technical, Quality and Regulatory Considerations
To monitor the control and consistency of products derived from biological systems, a broad array of analytical methods are used for biopharmaceutical release and stability testing. These methods include both classical and state-of-the-art technologies as well as new technologies as they emerge over time.During the life cycle of a product, several reasons can arise for making changes in existing analytical methods: e.g., improved sensitivity, specificity, or accuracy; increased operational robustness; streamlined workflows; shortened testing times; and lowered cost of testing. Note that replacing an existing method is not the same as adding a new method to a release or stability test panel. An added method has no previous data sets, so there is nothing to be “bridged.” But an existing method is tied to the historical data sets it produced (e.g., for Certificate of Analysis tests) and may still be producing (e.g., for ongoing stability protocols). Thus, significant changes in the method can create a substantial discontinuity between past and future data sets. Also, specification acceptance criteria that were based on historical data from the existing method could be affected by the measurement capabilities of the new method. So it is necessary to conduct an appropriately designed method-bridging study to demonstrate suitable performance of the new method relative to the one it is intended to replace. Note that a method-bridging study is distinctly different from a methodtransfer study. Method transfers demonstrate comparable performance of a method that exists in one laboratory in another. Neither is method-bridging the same as adding a new assay to an existing analytical testing regimen. A method introduced de novo is not linked to an existing data set generated by an older method that is being discontinued. In January 2014, a CASSS Chemistry, Manufaturing, and Controls Strategy Forum explored technical and quality issues associated with replacement of existing analytical methods by new methods during development — how that transition could be achieved smoothly while maintaining phase-appropriate regulatory compliance. Representatives from the US Food and Drug Administration’s (FDA’s) Center for Drug Evaluation and Research (CDER) and Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research (CBER) presented their agencies’ expectations for transitions in analytical methods. They also provided highlights of relevant examples. Additional regulatory perspectives were contributed by Health Canada representatives during panel discussions.

"3D Multi-scale line filter for segmentation and visualization of curvilinear structures in medical images
This paper describes a method for the enhancement of curvilinear structures like vessels and bronchi in 3D medical images. We develop a line-enhancement filter based on the eigenvalues of Hessian matrix aiming at both the discrimination of line structures from other structures and the recovery of original line structures from corrupted ones. The multi-scale responses of the line filters are integrated based on the equalization of noise level at each scale. The resulted multi-scale line filtered images provide significantly improved segmentation of curvilinear structures. The line-filtered images are also useful for the direct visualization of curvilinear structures by combining with a volume rendering technique even from conventional MR images. We show the usefulness of the method through the segmentation and visualization of vessels from MRA and MR images, and bronchi from CT images.",0,0,1

"Generating conjugate shapes using piecewise cubic spline functions
Abstract This paper proposes a method called “piecewise generation” for generating conjugate shapes from sets of data points on original cutters using cubic spline functions to fit the points. The differences between conventional generation methods and piecewise generation are presented. The main advantage of this method is that the analytical form of the cutter need not be provided. Therefore, only sets of data points on the cutter either derived from analytical form or measured with coordinate measuring machines (CMMs) are necessary for the conjugate shape to be derived using this method. It provides a practical and useful tool for conjugate-pair design verification and reverse engineering applications.",0,0,1
"A modeling and simulation study of anaerobic digestion in plug-flow reactors
In this work a mathematical model for the anaerobic digestion process in plug-flow reactors is proposed on the basis of mass balance considerations. The model consists of a system of parabolic partial differential equations for the variables representing the concentrations of the bio-components constituting the waste matrix and takes into account convective and diffusive phenomena. The plug-flow reactor is modelled as a one-dimensional domain; the waste matrix moves in the direction of the reactor axis and undergoes diffusive phenomena which reproduce the movement of the bio-components along the reactor axis due to a gradient in concentration. The velocity characterizing the convection of the waste matrix moving within the reactor is not fixed a priori but it is considered as an additional unknown of the mathematical problem. The variation in the convective velocity allows to account the mass variation occurring along a plugflow reactor due to the conversion of solids, which is an aspect not much analysed in the literature of dry anaerobic digestion in plug-flow reactors. The equation governing the convective velocity is derived by considering the following hypothesis: the density of the waste matrix within the reactor is supposed constant over time and the sum of the volume fractions of the bio-components constituting the waste matrix are constrained to sum up to unity. The waste matrix undergoes biochemical transformations catalysed by anaerobic microbial species which lead to the production of gaseous methane, the final product of the anaerobic digestion process. Biochemical processes are modelled using a simplified scheme and a differential equation is used to describe the dynamics of the produced gaseous methane. A finite difference scheme is used for the numerical integration. Lastly, the model consistency is showed through numerical simulations which investigate the effect of the variation of some operating parameters on the process performance. The model is then applied to a real case scenario of engineering interest. Simulations produce results in agreement with the experimental observations. This highlights that the model can serve as a tool for the optimal management and sizing of an anaerobic digestion plug-flow reactor.",1,1,1
"Vision-Based Tactile Sensor Mechanism for the Estimation of Contact Position and Force Distribution Using Deep Learning
This work describes the development of a vision-based tactile sensor system that utilizes the image-based information of the tactile sensor in conjunction with input loads at various motions to train the neural network for the estimation of tactile contact position, area, and force distribution. The current study also addresses pragmatic aspects, such as choice of the thickness and materials for the tactile fingertips and surface tendency, etc. The overall vision-based tactile sensor equipment interacts with an actuating motion controller, force gauge, and control PC (personal computer) with a LabVIEW software on it. The image acquisition was carried out using a compact stereo camera setup mounted inside the elastic body to observe and measure the amount of deformation by the motion and input load. The vision-based tactile sensor test bench was employed to collect the output contact position, angle, and force distribution caused by various randomly considered input loads for motion in X, Y, Z directions and RxRy rotational motion. The retrieved image information, contact position, area, and force distribution from different input loads with specified 3D position and angle are utilized for deep learning. A convolutional neural network VGG-16 classification modelhas been modified to a regression network model and transfer learning was applied to suit the regression task of estimating contact position and force distribution. Several experiments were carried out using thick and thin sized tactile sensors with various shapes, such as circle, square, hexagon, for better validation of the predicted contact position, contact area, and force distribution.",0,0,1

"On Optimal Designs Using Topology Optimization for Flow Through Porous Media Applications
Topology optimization (TopOpt) is a mathematical-driven design procedure to realize optimal material architectures. This procedure is often used to automate the design of devices involving flow through porous media, such as micro-fluidic devices. TopOpt offers material layouts that control the flow of fluids through porous materials, providing desired functionalities. Many prior studies in this application area have used Darcy equations for primal analysis and the minimum power theorem (MPT) to drive the optimization problem. But both these choices (Darcy equations and MPT) are restrictive and not valid for general working conditions of modern devices. Being simple and linear, Darcy equations are often used to model flow of fluids through porous media. However, two inherent assumptions of the Darcy model are: the viscosity of a fluid is a constant, and inertial effects are negligible. There is irrefutable experimental evidence that viscosity of a fluid, especially organic liquids, depends on the pressure. Given the typical small pore-sizes, inertial effects are dominant in micro-fluidic devices. Next, MPT is not a general principle and is not valid for (nonlinear) models that relax the assumptions of the Darcy model. This paper aims to overcome the mentioned deficiencies by presenting a general strategy for using TopOpt. First, we will consider nonlinear models that take into account the pressure-dependent viscosity and inertial effects, and study the effect of these nonlinearities on the optimal material layouts under TopOpt. Second, we will explore the rate of mechanical dissipation, valid even for nonlinear models, as an alternative for the objective function. Third, we will present analytical solutions of optimal designs for canonical problems; these solutions not only possess research and pedagogical values, but also facilitate verification of computer implementations. We have considered a pressure-driven problem with axisymmetry and got optimal material layouts using topology optimization by maximizing the total rate of dissipation. The left figure shows unphysical finger-like design patterns when the primal analysis does not enforce explicitly the underlying radial symmetry. The right figure shows that one can avoid such numerical pathologies if the primal analysis invokes axisymmetry conditions.",0,0,1

"Low Complexity Iterative Rake Detector for Orthogonal Time Frequency Space Modulation
This paper presents a linear complexity iterative rake detector for the recently proposed orthogonal time frequency space (OTFS) modulation scheme. The basic idea is to extract and combine the received multipath components of the transmitted symbols in the delay-Doppler grid using linear diversity combining schemes like maximal ratio combining (MRC), equal gain combining and selection combining to improve the SNR of the combined signal. We reformulate the OTFS input-output relation in the vector form by placing some null symbols in the delay-Doppler grid thereby exploiting the block circulant property of the channel matrix. Using the new input-output relation we propose a low complexity iterative detector based on the MRC scheme. The bit error rate (BER) performance of the proposed detector will be compared with the state of the art message passing detector and orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) scheme employing a single tap minimum mean square error (MMSE) equalizer. We also show that the frame error rate (FER) performance of the MRC detector can be improved by employing error correcting codes operating in the form of a turbo decision feedback equalizer (DFE).",0,1,0

"Joint Estimation of DOA and TDOA of Multiple Reflections in Mobile Communications
In a multipath communication scenario, it is often relevant to estimate the directions and relative delays of each multipath signal. We present an effect algorithm for the simultaneous estimation of these parameters by re-iterative super-resolution, beamforming, and MUSIC-like searching techniques. The algorithm first separates and estimates direction of arrival (DOA) of the multipath signals. Linear constrained minimum power beamforming is used to obtain the transmitted time function of the desired signal in certain incident angle. Then, time difference of arrival (TDOA) for the incident signals are mapped into phase shifts in the frequency domain. Using the DFT of the desired signal and the received data, we can separate the phase shifts in the frequency domain due to time delay by MUSIC-like searching. At the same time, the pairing of the estimated DOA and TDOA is automatically determined. Computer simulations illustrating the performance of the proposed algorithm with the Cramer-Rao bound are included.",0,1,1

"A compact two-phase twisted string actuation system: Modeling and validation
Abstract In this paper, we propose a compact twisted string actuation system that achieves a high contraction percentage (81%) on two phases: multi string twist and overtwist. This type of system can be used in many robotic applications, such as robotic hands and exoskeletons. The overtwist phase enables the development of more compact actuators based on the twisted string systems. Furthermore, by analyzing the previously developed mathematical models, we found out that a constant radius model should be applied for the overtwisting phase. Moreover, we propose an improvement of an existing model for prediction of the radius of the multi string system after they twist around each other. This model helps to better estimate the bundle diameter which results in a more precise mathematical model for multi string systems. The model was validated by performing experiments with 2, 4, 6 and 8 string systems.

"Model order determination and noise removal for modal parameter estimation
Given a noisy impulsive response function (IRF) that has been contributed by an unknown number of modes, this article proposes a different approach from the traditional methods for estimating modal parameters from this noisy IRF. The major difference lies in the way of handling noise and choosing the computational model order. Whereas the traditional approach accommodates noise by purposely increasing the computational model order, the proposed approach uses the actual system order as the computational model order and rejects noise prior to performing the modal parameter estimation. The proposed approach includes three steps: (1) model order (or number of modes) determination from the measured IRF—by finding the rank of a Hankel matrix constructed from the measured IRF, (2) noise removal from the measured IRF to obtain a filtered IRF—by implementing Cadzow's algorithm for the structured low rank approximation (SLRA) on the Hankel matrix, and (3) modal parameters estimation from the filtered IRF—by using the complex exponential method (Prony's method). Numerical studies include both synthesized and experimental data. While measured IRFs with mild and strong noise levels are simulated for a 5 degree-of-freedom mass-spring-dashpot system, the modal parameter estimations based on the filtered IRFs are very good for both noise levels. While experimental data are measured from two accelerometers mounted at a cantilever beam, the modal parameters estimated from the filtered IRFs of the two accelerometers are in excellent agreement.",0,1,1
"Effective Neighborhood Functions for the Flexible Job Shop Problem
The flexible job shop problem is an extension of the classical job shop scheduling problem which allows an operation to be performed by one machine out of a set of machines. The problem is to assign each operation to a machine (routing problem) and to order the operations on the machines (sequencing problem), such that the maximal completion time (makespan) of all operations is minimized. To solve the flexible job shop problem approximately, we use local search techniques and present two neighbourhood functions (Nopt1, Nopt2). Nopt2 is proved to be optimum connected. Nopt1 does not distinguish between routing or sequencing an operation. In both cases, a neighbour of a solution is obtained by moving an operation which affects the makespan. Our main contribution is a reduction of the set of possible neighbours to a subset for which can be proved that it always contains the neighbour with the lowest makespan. An efficient approach to compute such a subset of feasible neighbours is presented. A tabu search procedure is proposed and an extensive computational study is provided. We show that our procedure outperforms previous approaches. Copyright © 2000 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.",0,1,0

To optimize the highly underactuated system, we take a combination of black-box optimization and physics simulation of the whole grasp process. We show that this simulation-based approach can effectively consider the pre-contact motion, in-hand manipulation, power grasp stability, and even failure mode, which is difficult for the static-equilibrium-analysis-based approaches. In the last part of the letter, we demonstrate that a prototype gripper with the proposed structure and design parameters optimized under the proposed process successfully power-grasped a thin sheet, a softcover book, and a cylinder lying on a flat surface.",0,1,1
"How Can We Develop Explainable Systems? Insights from a Literature Review and an Interview Study
Quality aspects such as ethics, fairness, and transparency have been proven to be essential for trustworthy software systems. Explainability has been identified not only as a means to achieve all these three aspects in systems, but also as a way to foster users’ sentiments of trust. Despite this, research has only marginally focused on the activities and practices to develop explainable systems. To close this gap, we recommend six core activities and associated practices for the development of explainable systems based on the results of a literature review and an interview study. First, we identified and summarized activities and corresponding practices in the literature. To complement these findings, we conducted interviews with 19 industry professionals who provided recommendations for the development process of explainable systems and reviewed the activities and practices based on their expertise and knowledge. We compared and combined the findings of the interviews and the literature review to recommend the activities and assess their applicability in industry. Our findings demonstrate that the activities and practices are not only feasible, but can also be integrated in different development processes.",0,1,0
"Guide rail design for a passive suction cup based wall-climbing robot
This paper designs a guide rail for a wall-climbing robot based on passive suction cups. The designed guide rail can guarantee stable climbing of a wall-climbing robot. Firstly, to design the parameters of the guide rail, properties of the utilized passive suction cup are experimentally studied. Then a guide rail is designed to distribute the forces of the attached suction cups. It guarantees that the front attached suction cup of the robot obtains a large enough reaction force from the attached surface. Experimental results show that the robot prototype with the designed guide rail is able to stably climb a surface without falling off, since the front suction cup of the robot prototype can be completely attached to the climbing surface.",0,1,1
"Dissipation of stop-and-go waves via control of autonomous vehicles: Field experiments
Abstract Traffic waves are phenomena that emerge when the vehicular density exceeds a critical threshold. Considering the presence of increasingly automated vehicles in the traffic stream, a number of research activities have focused on the influence of automated vehicles on the bulk traffic flow. In the present article, we demonstrate experimentally that intelligent control of an autonomous vehicle is able to dampen stop-and-go waves that can arise even in the absence of geometric or lane changing triggers. Precisely, our experiments on a circular track with more than 20 vehicles show that traffic waves emerge consistently, and that they can be dampened by controlling the velocity of a single vehicle in the flow. We compare metrics for velocity, braking events, and fuel economy across experiments. These experimental findings suggest a paradigm shift in traffic management: flow control will be possible via a few mobile actuators (less than 5%) long before a majority of vehicles have autonomous capabilities.",0,1,1

"DPT-FSNet: Dual-Path Transformer Based Full-Band and Sub-Band Fusion Network for Speech Enhancement
Sub-band models have achieved promising results due to their ability to model local patterns in the spectrogram. Some studies further improve the performance by fusing sub-band and full-band information. However, the structure for the full-band and sub-band fusion model was not fully explored.

"Voltage stability analysis using generic dynamic load models
High levels of penetration of distributed generation and aggressive reactive power compensation with modern power electronics may result in the reversal of active and reactive power flows in future distribution grids. The voltage stability of these operating conditions may be very different from the more traditional power consumption regime. We study the stability characteristics of distribution networks with reversed power flow. After introducing a universal algebraic approach to characterize all the solutions of the power flow equations, we show that new solutions appear in the reversed power flow regime even in the simplest three bus systems. We show that the some of these solutions are stable and the system may exhibit a phenomenon of multistability, where multiple stable equilibrium coexist at the given set of parameters, and the system may converge to an undesirable equilibrium after a disturbance.

"Graph-Based Equilibrium Metrics for Dynamic Supply–Demand Systems With Applications to Ride-sourcing Platforms
Abstract How to dynamically measure the local-to-global spatio-temporal coherence between demand and supply networks is a fundamental task for ride-sourcing platforms, such as DiDi. Such coherence measurement is critically important for the quantification of the market efficiency and the comparison of different platform policies, such as dispatching. The aim of this paper is to introduce a graph-based equilibrium metric (GEM) to quantify the distance between demand and supply networks based on a weighted graph structure. We formulate GEM as the optimal objective value of an unbalanced optimal transport problem, which can be formulated as an equivalent linear programming and efficiently solved. We examine how the GEM can help solve three operational tasks of ride-sourcing platforms. The first one is that GEM achieves up to 70.6% reduction in root-mean-square error over the second-best distance measurement for the prediction accuracy of order answer rate. The second one is that the use of GEM for designing order dispatching policy increases drivers’ revenue for more than 1%, representing a huge improvement in number. The third one is that GEM can serve as an endpoint for comparing different platform policies in AB test. Supplementary materials for this article, including a standardized description of the materials available for reproducing the work, are available as an online supplement.",0,1,1
"Air filter diagnostics & prognostics in naturally aspired engines
Air filter diagnostics/prognostics are needed to determine the condition of the intake air filter in internal combustion engines and to indicate the need for maintenance. Monitoring air filter health helps saving on operational costs, maintaining optimal fuel economy, and planning for service/maintenance before failure. In the present paper, we propose an air filter diagnostics/prognostics method that relies on air flow models and control volume approach to assess filter health and estimate downstream pressure. The development is needed for non-boosted applications where a pressure sensor is generally not present downstream the air filter.

"Using multi-sensor data fusion for vibration fault diagnosis of rolling element bearings by accelerometer and load cell
This paper presents a new method for bearing fault diagnosis using the fusion of two primary sensors: an accelerometer and a load cell. A novel condition-based monitoring (CBM) system consisting of six modules: sensing, signal processing, feature extraction, classification, high-level fusion and decision making module has been proposed. To obtain acceleration and load signals, a work bench has been used. In the next stage, signal indices for each signal in both time and frequency domains have been calculated. After calculation of signal indices, principal component analysis is employed for redundancy reduction. Two principal features have been extracted from load and acceleration indices. In the fourth module, K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN) classifier has been used in order to identify the condition of the ball bearing based on vibration signal and load signal. In the fifth module, a high-level sensor fusion is used to derive information that would not be available from single sensor. Based on situation assessment carried out during the training process of classifier, a relationship between bearing condition and sensor performance has been found. Finally, a logical program has been used to decide about the condition of the ball bearing. The test results demonstrate that the load cell is powerful to detect the healthy ball bearings from the defected ones, and the accelerometer is useful to detect the location of fault. Experimental results show the effectiveness of this method.",0,0,1

"Webrooming: A Way of Dealing with Uncertainties in Purchasing
Purpose – This study aims to analyze ways in which uncertainty-related factors inﬂuence the intention of webrooming, a cross-channel buying behavior. The authors suggest that four factors (uncertainty avoidance, risk aversion, anticipated regret, and the need for touch) differ in their nature and, therefore, may exert diﬀerent (direct or indirect) inﬂuence on the webrooming intention. Design/Methodology/Approach – The SEM analysis was applied to online survey data obtained in Lithuania. Findings and implications – The study conﬁrms that uncertainty avoidance and risk aversion, as quite broadly conceptualized factors, have an indirect inﬂuence on the webrooming intention that is mediated by Internet mavenism. As anticipated regret is a more transaction-related factor, its inﬂuence on the webrooming intention is direct. Due to its speciﬁc nature, the need for touch has both direct and indirect inﬂuence on the webrooming intention. These ﬁndings contribute to ﬁlling the gaps in scientiﬁc knowledge in two ways. First, the study makes the ﬁrst attempt to categorize uncertainty-linked antecedents in webrooming context and then assess the type of inﬂuence they exert. Second, it shows the direction and strength of the measured relations in the context of apparel product category. Additionally, it has managerial implications for retailing: cross-channel behavior in this category is largely triggered by uncertainty-related factors. Limitations – Webrooming intention was assessed only in one product category (apparel). Search results should be broadened to include other product categories. Moreover, the uncertainty-related factors of webrooming intention should be tested together with other types of factors that are important for this intention. Originality – The variety of factors used to investigate the inﬂuence on webrooming intention is quite broad. This study aims to acknowledge the inﬂuence of uncertainty-related factors on webrooming intention. Currently, scientiﬁc knowledge on this relationship is rather scarce.",0,0,0
"Checking the checklist: the effect of training on the application and effectiveness of checklist-based risk assessments
This report details a programme of research undertaken on behalf of IOSH
and intended to investigate the critical factors which control the effectiveness
of checklist-based risk assessments. Through five research phases, partner
companies from UK manufacturing industries provided case examples of
current practice and a resource of participants to conduct user trials.
An extensive literature review revealed that previous research had focussed
on the effectiveness and reliability of checklists in risk assessment. However,
very little research had been conducted in assessing the effectiveness of the
actual design of checklists and the level of accompanying training that is
required to ensure they are used correctly.
A questionnaire survey of 88 companies of more than five employees revealed
the state of current practice and a wide diversity of resources and application
of safety practices. From these companies 15 were selected to undertake an
in-depth walk through involving a site inspection, interviews with Health and
Safety professionals and an audit of the health and safety practices.
From the audited companies four were selected to take part in user trials
involving the provision and evaluation of control checklists and accompanying
training. This provided a large data set which could be scrutinised to identify
the effective features of checklists and the benefits training may offer.
The results reveal a complex picture with numerous confounding influences.
Specific features of checklists and training offer benefits in some
circumstances and limitations in others. A lack of clear patterns suggests that
the high degree of variability in companies and staff make prescriptive
solutions unreliable as safety interventions.
Recommendations are made for assessing the content of checklists but
reservations remain over the effectiveness of a single solution for use in any
specific company.",0,0,0
"Full-Body Torque-Level Non-linear Model Predictive Control for Aerial Manipulation
Non-linear model predictive control (nMPC) is a powerful approach to control complex robots (such as humanoids, quadrupeds or unmanned aerial manipulators (UAMs)) as it brings important advantages over other existing techniques. The full-body dynamics, along with the prediction capability of the optimal control problem (OCP) solved at the core of the controller, allows to actuate the robot in line with its dynamics. This fact enhances the robot capabilities and allows, e.g., to perform intricate maneuvers at high dynamics while optimizing the amount of energy used. Despite the many similarities between humanoids or quadrupeds and UAMs, full-body torque-level nMPC has rarely been applied to UAMs. This paper provides a thorough description of how to use such techniques in the field of aerial manipulation. We give a detailed explanation of the different parts involved in the OCP, from the UAM dynamical model to the residuals in the cost function. We develop and compare three different nMPC controllers: Weighted MPC, Rail MPC and Carrot MPC, which differ on the structure of their OCPs and on how these are updated at every time step. To validate the proposed framework, we present a wide variety of simulated case studies. First, we evaluate the trajectory generation problem, i.e., optimal control problems solved offline, involving different kinds of motions (e.g., aggressive maneuvers or contact locomotion) for different types UAMs. Then, we assess the performance of the three nMPC controllers, i.e., closed-loop controllers solved online, through a variety of realistic simulations. For the benefit of the community, we have made available the source code related to this work.",0,1,1
"Analysis of High-Frequency Impedance Measurement Techniques for Power Line Network Sensing
A major aspect in power line distribution networks is the constant monitoring of the network properties. With the advent of the smart grid concept, distributed monitoring has started complementing the information of the central stations. In this paper, power line communications modems deployed throughout the network provide a tool to monitor high-frequency components of the signals traveling through a power line network. We propose, therefore, to use them not only as communication devices but also as network sensors. Besides classical voltage measurements, these sensors can be designed to monitor high-frequency impedances, which provide useful information about the power line network, as for instance status of the topology, cable degradation, and occurrence of faults. In this paper, we provide a technical analysis of different voltage and impedance measurement techniques that can be integrated into power line modems. We assess the accuracy of the techniques under analysis in the presence of network noise, and we discuss the statistical characteristics of the measurement noise. We finally compare the performances of the examined techniques when applied to the fault detection problem in distribution networks, in order to establish which technique gives more accurate results.",0,0,1

"Maneuver Decision of UAV in Short-Range Air Combat Based on Deep Reinforcement Learning
With the development of artificial intelligence and integrated sensor technologies, unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) are more and more applied in the air combats. A bottleneck that constrains the capability of UAVs against manned vehicles is the autonomous maneuver decision, which is a very challenging problem in the short-range air combat undergoing highly dynamic and uncertain maneuvers of enemies. In this paper, an autonomous maneuver decision model is proposed for the UAV short-range air combat based on reinforcement learning, which mainly includes the aircraft motion model, one-to-one short-range air combat evaluation model and the maneuver decision model based on deep Q network (DQN). However, such model includes a high dimensional state and action space which requires huge computation load for DQN training using traditional methods. Then, a phased training method, called “basic-confrontation”, which is based on the idea that human beings gradually learn from simple to complex is proposed to help reduce the training time while getting suboptimal but efficient results. Finally, one-to-one short-range air combats are simulated under different target maneuver policies. Simulation results show that the proposed maneuver decision model and training method can help the UAV achieve autonomous decision in the air combats and obtain an effective decision policy to defeat the opponent.",0,1,1

This paper presents the results of a research study related to software system failures, with the goal of understanding how we might better evolve, maintain and support software systems in production. We have qualitatively analyzed thirty incidents: fifteen collected through in depth interviews with engineers, and fifteen sampled from publicly published incident reports (generally produced as part of postmortem reviews). Our analysis focused on understanding and categorizing how failures occurred, and how they were detected, investigated and mitigated. We also captured analytic insights related to the current state of the practice and associated challenges in the form of 11 key observations. For example, we observed that failures can cascade through a system leading to major outages; and that often engineers do not understand the scaling limits of systems they are supporting until those limits are exceeded. We argue that the challenges we have identified can lead to improvements to how systems are engineered and supported.",0,0,1
"OpenSHC: A Versatile Multilegged Robot Controller
Multilegged robots have the ability to perform stable locomotion on relatively rough terrain. However, the complexity of legged robots over wheeled or tracked robots make them difficult to control.

"On the Performance of the MIMO Zero-Forcing Receiver in the Presence of Channel Estimation Error
By employing spatial multiplexing, multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) wireless antenna systems provide increases in capacity without the need for additional spectrum or power. Zero-forcing (ZF) detection is a simple and effective technique for retrieving multiple transmitted data streams at the receiver. However the detection requires knowledge of the channel state information (CSI) and in practice accurate CSI may not be available. In this letter, we investigate the effect of channel estimation error on the performance of MIMO ZF receivers in uncorrelated Rayleigh flat fading channels. By modeling the estimation error as independent complex Gaussian random variables, tight approximations for both the post-processing SNR distribution and bit error rate (BER) for MIMO ZF receivers with M-QAM and M-PSK modulated signals are derived in closed-form. Numerical results demonstrate the tightness of our analysis",0,1,0
"Active Distribution System Management: A Dual-Horizon Scheduling Framework for DSO/TSO Interface Under Uncertainty
Active distribution system management (ADSM) aims at optimally operating distribution network assets with a high penetration of distributed energy resources (DERs) while taking into account operational uncertainties, market constraints, and scheduled power flows at the interface with the transmission system. A novel framework for ADSM, which incorporates a dual-horizon rolling scheduling model based on dynamic ac optimal power flow, is proposed in this paper. In the first stage (planning), energy import/export is committed for given times ahead at the grid supply point considering local variable generation and load forecasts. At the second stage (operation) deviations from the schedules are minimised by controlling various assets and DER, including electrical energy storage (EES). We demonstrate how crucial it is to properly consider uncertainties (for instance, associated with forecasts) over different time scales. Case study results on a real U.K. distribution network show that the proposed ADSM approach can provide credible operational strategies to maximise renewable penetration, minimize deviations from time-ahead schedules, and estimate the required level of local reserves from dispatchable generation and EES while realistically accounting for uncertainty. The framework and model formulation proposed can thus be seen as a key tool to facilitate the transition from distribution network operators to distribution system operators and their interaction with transmission system operators.",0,1,1
"Real time human motion imitation of anthropomorphic dual arm robot based on Cartesian impedance control
This paper presented a real-time human motion imitation approach to control an anthropomorphic dual arm robot by human demonstration. We use the processed positions of human skeleton joints from Kinect sensor as commands directly to control the robot arms by using Cartesian impedance control to follow the human motion without solving inverse kinematics problem. In order to avoid a jerky robot arm motion, we apply an on-line trajectory generator algorithm to obtain a smooth movement trajectory by imposing the limit of velocity and acceleration. Moreover, the self-collision problem has also been considered. When the distance between two parts of body is close enough, a repulsive force will automatically generate to prevent collision. Taking the robot capability and safe issue into account, the output force is restricted to ensure that the action of robot is stable. We demonstrate the feasibility of the approach by implementing the human motion imitation system on a humanoid dual arm robot developed in our lab. The experimental results show that the system is in good practice and flexible enough to imitate various human motions.",0,1,1

"A Novel Visual Fault Detection and Classification System for Semiconductor Manufacturing Using Stacked Hybrid Convolutional Neural Networks
Automated visual inspection in the semiconductor industry aims to detect and classify manufacturing defects utilizing modern image processing techniques. While an earliest possible detection of defect patterns allows quality control and automation of manufacturing chains, manufacturers benefit from an increased yield and reduced manufacturing costs. Since classical image processing systems are limited in their ability to detect novel defect patterns, and machine learning approaches often involve a tremendous amount of computational effort, this contribution introduces a novel deep neural network-based hybrid approach. Unlike classical deep neural networks, a multi-stage system allows the detection and classification of the finest structures in pixel size within high-resolution imagery. Consisting of stacked hybrid convolutional neural networks (SH-CNN) and inspired by current approaches of visual attention, the realized system draws the focus over the level of detail from its structures to more task-relevant areas of interest. The results of our test environment show that the SH-CNN outperforms current approaches of learning-based automated visual inspection, whereas a distinction depending on the level of detail enables the elimination of defect patterns in earlier stages of the manufacturing process.",0,1,0
"Learning quadrupedal locomotion over challenging terrain
A learning-based locomotion controller enables a quadrupedal ANYmal robot to traverse challenging natural environments. Legged locomotion can extend the operational domain of robots to some of the most challenging environments on Earth. However, conventional controllers for legged locomotion are based on elaborate state machines that explicitly trigger the execution of motion primitives and reflexes. These designs have increased in complexity but fallen short of the generality and robustness of animal locomotion. Here, we present a robust controller for blind quadrupedal locomotion in challenging natural environments. Our approach incorporates proprioceptive feedback in locomotion control and demonstrates zero-shot generalization from simulation to natural environments. The controller is trained by reinforcement learning in simulation. The controller is driven by a neural network policy that acts on a stream of proprioceptive signals. The controller retains its robustness under conditions that were never encountered during training: deformable terrains such as mud and snow, dynamic footholds such as rubble, and overground impediments such as thick vegetation and gushing water. The presented work indicates that robust locomotion in natural environments can be achieved by training in simple domains.",0,1,1
"RAM analysis and availability optimization of thermal power plant water circulation system using PSO
Abstract This paper presents reliability, availability, and maintainability (RAM) analysis framework for evaluating the performance of a circulation system of water (WCS) used in a coal-fired power plant (CFPP). The performance of WCS is evaluated using a reliability block diagram (RBD), fault tree analysis (FTA), and Markov birth–death probabilistic approach. In this work, the system under study consists of five subsystems connected in series and parallel configuration namely condensate extraction pump (CEP), low-pressure feed water heater (LPH), deaerator (DR), boiler feed pump (BFP), high-pressure feed water heater (HPH). The reliability block diagram (RBD) and fault tree approach (FTA) have been employed for the performance evaluation of WCS. The Markov probabilistic approach based simulation model is developed. The transition diagram of the proposed model represented several states with full working capacity, reduced capacity, and failed state. The ranking of critical equipment is decided on the basis of criticality level of equipment. The study results revealed that the boiler feed pump affects the system availability at most, while the failure of deaerator affects it least. The availability of the system is optimized using the particle swarm optimization method. The optimized availability parameter (TBF, TTR) based modified maintenance strategy is recommended to enhance the availability of the plant system. The optimized failure rate and repair rate parameters of the subsystem are used to suggest a suitable maintenance strategy for the water circulation system of the thermal power plant. The proposed RAM framework helps the decision-makers to plan the maintenance activity as per the criticality level of subsystems and allocate the resources accordingly.",0,0,1

Objective This paper aims to help practitioners and researchers to better understand the context and the problems that many companies face day to day in their organizations when they try to accelerate software delivery and the main drivers that move these companies to adopting DevOps. Method We conducted an exploratory study by leveraging in depth, semi-structured interviews to relevant stakeholders of 30 multinational software-intensive companies, together with industrial workshops and observations at organizations’ facilities that supported triangulation. Additionally, we conducted an inter-coder agreement analysis, which is not usually addressed in qualitative studies in software engineering, to increase reliability and reduce authors bias of the drawn findings. Results The research explores the problems and expected outcomes that moved companies to adopt DevOps and reveals a set of patterns and anti-patterns about the reasons why companies are instilling a DevOps culture. Conclusions This study aims to strengthen evidence and support practitioners in making better informed about which problems trigger a DevOps transition and most common expected results.",0,0,0
"Building Bridges: Generative Artworks to Explore AI Ethics
In recent years, there has been an increased emphasis on understanding and mitigating adverse impacts of artificial intelligence (AI) technologies on society. Across academia, industry, and government bodies, a variety of endeavours are being pursued towards enhancing AI ethics. A significant challenge in the design of ethical AI systems is that there are multiple stakeholders in the AI pipeline, each with their own set of constraints and interests. These different perspectives are often not understood, due in part to communication gaps. For example, AI researchers who design and develop AI models are not necessarily aware of the instability induced in consumers’ lives by the compounded effects of AI decisions. Educating different stakeholders about their roles and responsibilities in the broader context becomes necessary. In this position paper, we outline some potential ways in which generative artworks can play this role by serving as accessible and powerful educational tools for surfacing different perspectives. We hope to spark interdisciplinary discussions about computational creativity broadly as a tool for enhancing AI ethics.",0,0,0
"Low-PAPR Multi-Channel OOK Waveform for IEEE 802.11ba Wake-Up Radio
The peak-to-average-power ratio (PAPR) of the frequency domain multiplexed wake-up signals (WUSs) specified in IEEE P802.11ba can be very large and difficult to manage since it depends on the number and allocation of the active channels, and the data rate on each channel. To address this issue, we propose a transmission scheme based on complementary sequences (CSs) for multiple WUSs multiplexed in the frequency domain. We discuss how to construct CSs compatible with the framework of IEEE P802.11ba by exploiting a recursive Golay complementary pair (GCP) construction to reduce the instantaneous power fluctuations in time. We compare the proposed scheme with the other options under a non-linear power amplifier (PA) distortion. Numerical results show that the proposed scheme can lower the PAPR of the transmitted signal in frequency division multiple access (FDMA) scenarios more than 3 dB and yields a superior error rate performance under severe PA distortion.",0,0,0
"Design Space Exploration of Power Delivery For Advanced Packaging Technologies
In this paper, a design space exploration of power delivery networks is performed for multi-chip 2.5-D and 3-D IC technologies. The focus of the paper is the effective placement of the voltage regulator modules (VRMs) for power supply noise (PSN) suppression. Multiple on-package VRM configurations have been analyzed and compared. Additionally, 3D IC chip-on-VRM and backside-of-the-package VRM configurations are studied. From the PSN perspective, the 3D IC chip-on-VRM case suppresses the PSN the most even with high current density hotspots. The paper also studies the impact of different parameters such as VRM-chip distance on the package, on-chip decoupling capacitor density, etc. on the PSN.",0,0,1
"Practical issues in the combining of MIMO techniques and RoF in OFDM/A systems
In this paper, several multipleinput multipleoutput (MIMO) techniques are studied for OFDM/A systems which have antennas connected to the base station with radio over fiber (RoF). The delay effects caused by the optical fibers on the fixed-beam transmit beamforming are studied via Monte Carlo simulations. Also the effect of combining RoF with other MIMO techniques in OFDM/A systems, like spatial multiplexing, spacetime coding, and receiver beamforming, is discussed. The results indicate that for phase shift differences lower than those corresponding to a 1 m unevenness in the fiber's length, RoF does not significantly decrease the performance of an OFDM/A system with fixed transmit beamforming, and with other MIMO techniques, the effect of employing RoF is negligible.",0,0,0

"A Printed Vivaldi Antenna with Improved Radiation Patterns by Using Two Pairs of Eye-Shaped Slots for UWB Applications
In this paper, a printed Vivaldi antenna with two pairs of eye-shaped slots is proposed for UWB applications. By using two pairs of eye-shaped slots, the side lobe levels of the radiation pattern are reduced, and the antenna gain is improved at low frequencies. To illustrate the efiectiveness of the proposed design, a prototype of the proposed antenna is fabricated and measured. Experimental results show that the proposed antenna presents a measured impedance bandwidth, deflned by jS11j < i10dB, from 3 to 12.8GHz with a compact size (36mm£36mm). Good unidirectional radiation characteristics with a front-to-back ratio better than 10dB are also achieved. The measured gain is better than 3.7dBi in the operating frequency band. In addition, the measured group delay of the proposed antenna is around 1.2ns with a variation less than §0:5ns.",0,0,0
"Oleoplaning droplets on lubricated surfaces
Recently, there has been much interest in using lubricated surfaces to achieve extreme liquid repellency: a foreign droplet immiscible with the underlying lubricant layer was shown to slide off at a small tilt angle <5°. This behaviour was hypothesized to arise from a thin lubricant overlayer film sandwiched between the droplet and solid substrate, but this has not been observed experimentally. Here, using thin-film interference, we are able to visualize the intercalated film under both static and dynamic conditions. We further demonstrate that for a moving droplet, the film thickness follows the Landau–Levich–Derjaguin law. The droplet is therefore oleoplaning—akin to tyres hydroplaning on a wet road—with minimal dissipative force and no contact line pinning. The techniques and insights presented in this study will inform future work on the fundamentals of wetting for lubricated surfaces and enable their rational design. Lubricated surfaces are known to display extreme liquid repellency. Such behaviour is now confirmed to be due to the formation of a film between the surface and the repelled liquid, with a thickness profile following the Landau–Levich–Derjaguin law.",1,1,1
"Machine Learning for Combinatorial Optimisation of Partially-Specified Problems: Regret Minimisation as a Unifying Lens
It is increasingly common to solve combinatorial optimisation problems that are partially-speciﬁed. We survey the case where the objective function or the relations between variables are not known or are only partially speciﬁed. The challenge is to learn them from available data, while taking into account a set of hard constraints that a solution must satisfy, and that solving the optimisation problem (esp. during learning) is computationally very demanding. This paper overviews four seemingly unrelated approaches, that can each be viewed as learning the objective function of a hard combinatorial optimisation problem: 1) surrogate-based optimisation, 2) empirical model learning, 3) decision-focused learning (‘predict + optimise’), and 4) structured-output prediction. We formalise each learning paradigm, at ﬁrst in the ways commonly found in the literature, and then bring the formalisations together in a compatible way using regret. We discuss the differences and interac-tions between these frameworks, highlight the opportunities for cross-fertilization and survey open directions.",1,1,0
"Evaluating Credibility of Social Media Information: Current Challenges, Research Directions and Practical Criteria
PurposeSocial media pose serious challenges to information evaluation, which can make credibility evaluation more difficult compared to other information resources. As a result, this paper aims to explore related challenges and research directions to put forth a set of criteria practical for actual users in their decision-making.Design/methodology/approachRelated literature in such disciplines as information, communication and media sciences were carefully searched and assessed. Once challenges and research directions were identified, a literature coding approach was considered to design a conceptual framework incorporating the main criteria used for evaluating information found from social media.FindingsSome areas of consideration such as political concerns, health information, organizational issues and purchasing behavior are among the main challenges inevitable in evaluating current social media information.

"Learned Spatial Representations for Few-shot Talking-Head Synthesis
We propose a novel approach for few-shot talking-head synthesis. While recent works in neural talking heads have produced promising results, they can still produce images that do not preserve the identity of the subject in source images. We posit this is a result of the entangled representation of each subject in a single latent code that models 3D shape information, identity cues, colors, lighting and even background details. In contrast, we propose to factorize the representation of a subject into its spatial and style components. Our method generates a target frame in two steps. First, it predicts a discrete and dense spatial layout for the target image. Second, an image generator utilizes the predicted layout for spatial denormalization and synthesizes the target frame. We experimentally show that this disentangled representation leads to a significant improvement over previous methods, both quantitatively and qualitatively.",1,0,0

"Thin, flexible, and scalable mobile robot driven by electrostatic zipping actuators
Small-scale soft mobile robots are an attractive solution to gain access to hard-to-reach places. We demonstrate a thin (~4 mm) and flexible mobile robot, 8 cm x 9 cm, mass 4 g, that uses 6 electrostatic zipping actuators with hydraulic coupling, to generate stepwise linear motion. The device is made from laminated films of polymer materials including a high-permittivity layer of a PVDF-HFP/BaTiO3 composite. Typical operating voltages are around 2 kV, and actuation frequencies range from 1 to 10 steps per second. The HAXELs in the demonstrated device have a side length of 20 mm. Each one is segmented into 4 quadrants that can be independently actuated. This enables each of the robot’s 6 feet to move both front-to-back and side-to-side, allowing for sophisticated motion of the robot (i.e., forward/backward, steering, and sideways movement). We vary several design parameters and investigate different gaits, exploring parts of the large parameter space of possible designs and motion sequences. Locomotion speed up to 2.4 mm/s and a maximum payload capacity of 80 g (20x its own weight) are demonstrated for certain configurations. The actuator scale and other design parameters could be easily adjusted to optimize for movement speed or payload capacity, depending on the intended application.",0,0,1

"Extended Load Flexibility of Industrial P2H Plants: A Process Constraint-Aware Scheduling Approach
The operational flexibility of industrial power-to-hydrogen (P2H) plants enables admittance of volatile renewable power and provides auxiliary regulatory services for the power grid. Aiming to extend the flexibility of the P2H plant further, this work presents a scheduling method by considering detailed process constraints of the alkaline electrolyzers. Unlike existing works that assume constant load range, the presented scheduling framework fully exploits the dynamic processes of the electrolyzer, including temperature and hydrogen-to-oxygen (HTO) crossover, to improve operational flexibility. Varying energy conversion efficiency under different load levels and temperature is also considered. The scheduling model is solved by proper mathematical transformation as a mixed-integer linear programming (MILP), which determines the on-off-standby states and power levels of different electrolyzers in the P2H plant for daily operation. With experiment-verified constraints, a case study show that compared to the existing scheduling approach, the improved flexibility leads to a 1.627% profit increase when the P2H plant is directly coupled to the photovoltaic power.",0,0,1

"Nested Arrays: A Novel Approach to Array Processing With Enhanced Degrees of Freedom
A new array geometry, which is capable of significantly increasing the degrees of freedom of linear arrays, is proposed. This structure is obtained by systematically nesting two or more uniform linear arrays and can provide O(N2) degrees of freedom using only N physical sensors when the second-order statistics of the received data is used. The concept of nesting is shown to be easily extensible to multiple stages and the structure of the optimally nested array is found analytically. It is possible to provide closed form expressions for the sensor locations and the exact degrees of freedom obtainable from the proposed array as a function of the total number of sensors. This cannot be done for existing classes of arrays like minimum redundancy arrays which have been used earlier for detecting more sources than the number of physical sensors. In minimum-input-minimum-output (MIMO) radar, the degrees of freedom are increased by constructing a longer virtual array through active sensing. The method proposed here, however, does not require active sensing and is capable of providing increased degrees of freedom in a completely passive setting. To utilize the degrees of freedom of the nested co-array, a novel spatial smoothing based approach to DOA estimation is also proposed, which does not require the inherent assumptions of the traditional techniques based on fourth-order cumulants or quasi stationary signals. As another potential application of the nested array, a new approach to beamforming based on a nonlinear preprocessing is also introduced, which can effectively utilize the degrees of freedom offered by the nested arrays. The usefulness of all the proposed methods is verified through extensive computer simulations.",0,1,1
"Design of a parabolic reflector antenna with a compact splash-plate feed
A parabolic reflector antenna with a compact splash-plate feed is designed and optimized in this paper. A dielectric connection portion is used to combine the waveguide and splash-plate sub-reflector. The use of dielectric material not only can achieve low blockage as no struts are needed to support the feed, but also can adjust the impedance of the antenna. The designed antenna is able to achieve a low VSWR <; 1.17 within the frequency range of 21.2 GHz-23 GHz. In addition, some chokes are added on the back of the splash-plate to suppress the radiation of the undesired directions. A corrugated fence is added along the edge of parabolic reflector to achieve better performance, in which the front to back ratio is significantly improved. The gain of the designed parabolic reflector antenna is 40.1-41.06 dBi within 21.2 GHz-23 GHz. Moreover, by using the designed splash-plate feed, simulation results show that the radiation efficiency of the parabolic reflector antenna is about 57.7%-62.5% within the operation bandwidth.",0,1,1

"On peculiarities of positional effects in sponsored search
Click logs provide a unique and highly valuable source of human judgments on ads' relevance. However, clicks are heavily biased by lots of factors. Two main factors that are widely acknowledged to be the most influential ones are neighboring ads and presentation order. The latter is referred to as positional effect. A popular practice to recover the ads quality cleaned from positional bias is to adopt click models based on examination or cascade hypothesis originally developed for organic search. In this paper we show the strong evidence that this practice is far from perfection when considering the top ads block on a search engine result page (SERP). We show that cascade hypothesis is the most questionable one because of important differences between organic and sponsored search results that may encourage users to analyze the whole ads-block before clicking. Additionally, we design a testing setup for an unbiased evaluation of click model prediction accuracy.",0,0,0
"Value and benefits of model‐based systems engineering (MBSE): Evidence from the literature
Traditional document‐based practices in systems engineering are being transitioned to model‐based ones. Adoption of model‐based systems engineering (MBSE) continues to grow in industry and government, and MBSE continues to be a major research theme in the systems engineering community. In fact, MBSE remains a central element in the International Council on Systems Engineering (INCOSE)’s vision for 2025. Examining systems engineering literature, this paper presents an assessment of the extent to which benefits and value of MBSE are supported by empirical evidence. A systematic review of research and practice papers in major systems engineering archival journals and conference proceedings was conducted. Evidence was categorized in four types, two of which inductively emerged from the results: measured, observed (without a formal measurement process), perceived (claimed without evidence), and backed by other references. Results indicate that two thirds of claimed MBSE benefits are only supported by perceived evidence, while only two papers reported measured evidence. The aggregate assessment presented in this paper indicates that claims about the value and benefits of MBSE are mainly based on expectation. We argue that evidence supporting the value and benefits of MBSE remains inconclusive.",0,1,0
"Determination of Individual Investors' Financial Risk Tolerance by Machine Learning Methods
Financial risk tolerance refers to the amount of risk that an investor is willing to take in order to obtain returns.

"A New Metric for Lumpy and Intermittent Demand Forecasts: Stock-keeping-oriented Prediction Error Costs
Forecasts of product demand are essential for short- and long-term optimization of logistics and production. Thus, the most accurate prediction possible is desirable. In order to optimally train predictive models, the deviation of the forecast compared to the actual demand needs to be assessed by a proper metric. However, if a metric does not represent the actual prediction error, predictive models are insufficiently optimized and, consequently, will yield inaccurate predictions. The most common metrics such as MAPE or RMSE, however, are not suitable for the evaluation of forecasting errors, especially for lumpy and intermittent demand patterns, as they do not sufficiently account for, e.g., temporal shifts (prediction before or after actual demand) or cost-related aspects. 
Therefore, we propose a novel metric that, in addition to statistical considerations, also addresses business aspects. Additionally, we evaluate the metric based on simulated and real demand time series from the automotive aftermarket.",0,1,0
"Force Generation by Parallel Combinations of Fiber-Reinforced Fluid-Driven Actuators
The compliant structure of soft robotic systems enables a variety of novel capabilities in comparison to traditional rigid-bodied robots. A subclass of soft fluid-driven actuators known as fiber-reinforced elastomeric enclosures (FREEs) is particularly well suited as actuators for these types of systems. FREEs are inherently soft and can impart spatial forces without imposing a rigid structure. Furthermore, they can be configured to produce a large variety of force and moment combinations. In this letter, we explore the potential of combining multiple differently configured FREEs in parallel to achieve fully controllable multidimensional soft actuation. To this end, we propose a novel methodology to represent and calculate the generalized forces generated by soft actuators as a function of their internal pressure. This methodology relies on the notion of a state dependent fluid Jacobian that yields a linear expression for force. We employ this concept to construct the set of all possible forces that can be generated by a soft system in a given state. This force zonotope can be used to inform the design and control of parallel combinations of soft actuators. The approach is verified experimentally with the parallel combination of three carefully designed actuators constrained to a 2DOF test platform. The force predictions matched measured values with a root-mean-square error of less than 1.5 N force and  $\mathbf {8 \times 10^{-3}}$ Nm moment, demonstrating the utility of the presented methodology.",0,1,1

"Fundamental Limits on the Subthreshold Slope in Schottky Source/Drain Black Phosphorus Field-Effect Transistors.
The effect of thickness, temperature, and source-drain bias voltage, V(DS), on the subthreshold slope, SS, and off-state properties of black phosphorus (BP) field-effect transistors is reported. Locally back-gated p-MOSFETs with thin HfO2 gate dielectrics were analyzed using exfoliated BP layers ranging in thickness from ∼4 to 14 nm. SS was found to degrade with increasing V(DS) and to a greater extent in thicker flakes. In one of the thinnest devices, SS values as low as 126 mV/decade were achieved at V(DS) = -0.1 V, and the devices displayed record performance at V(DS) = -1.0 V with SS = 161 mV/decade and on-to-off current ratio of 2.84 × 10(3) within a 1 V gate bias window. A one-dimensional transport model has been utilized to extract the band gap, interface state density, and the work function of the metal contacts. The model shows that SS degradation in BP MOSFETs occurs due to the ambipolar turn on of the carriers injected at the drain before the onset of purely thermionic-limited transport at the source. The model is further utilized to provide design guidelines for achieving ideal SS and meet off-state leakage targets, and it is found that band edge work functions and thin flakes are required for ideal operation at high V(DS). This work represents a comprehensive analysis of the fundamental performance limitations of Schottky-contacted BP MOSFETs under realistic operating conditions.",0,1,1

"Planning regional-scale electric power systems under uncertainty: A case study of Jing-Jin-Ji region, China
In this study, a copula-based stochastic fuzzy-credibility programming (CSFP) method is developed for planning regional-scale electric power systems (REPS). CSFP cannot only deal with multiple uncertainties presented as random variables, fuzzy sets, interval values as well as their combinations, but also reflect uncertain interactions among multiple random variables owning different probability distributions and having previously unknown correlations. Then, a CSFP-REPS model is formulated for planning the electric power systems (EPS) of the Jing-Jin-Ji region, where multiple scenarios with different joint and individual probabilities as well as different credibility levels are examined. Results reveal that electricity shortage would offset [4.8, 5.2]% and system cost would reduce [3.2, 3.3]% under synergistic effect scheme. Results also disclose that the study region’s future electricity-supply pattern would tend to the transition to renewable energies and the share of renewable energies would increase approximately 10% over the planning horizon. Compared to the conventional stochastic programming, the developed CSFP method can more effectively analyze individual and interactive effects of multiple random variables, so that the loss of uncertain information can be mitigated and the robustness of solution can be enhanced. Moreover, based on the main effect analysis and regression analysis, CSFP-REPS can provide multiple joint planning strategies in a cost- and computation-effective way. Findings are useful for reflecting interactions among multiple random variables and disclosing their joint effects on modeling outputs of REPS planning problems.",0,0,1

"Adoption and Effects of Software Engineering Best Practices in Machine Learning
Background. The increasing reliance on applications with machine learning (ML) components calls for mature engineering techniques that ensure these are built in a robust and future-proof manner. Aim. We aim to empirically determine the state of the art in how teams develop, deploy and maintain software with ML components. Method. We mined both academic and grey literature and identified 29 engineering best practices for ML applications. We conducted a survey among 313 practitioners to determine the degree of adoption for these practices and to validate their perceived effects. Using the survey responses, we quantified practice adoption, differentiated along demographic characteristics, such as geography or team size. We also tested correlations and investigated linear and non-linear relationships between practices and their perceived effect using various statistical models. Results. Our findings indicate, for example, that larger teams tend to adopt more practices, and that traditional software engineering practices tend to have lower adoption than ML specific practices. Also, the statistical models can accurately predict perceived effects such as agility, software quality and traceability, from the degree of adoption for specific sets of practices. Combining practice adoption rates with practice importance, as revealed by statistical models, we identify practices that are important but have low adoption, as well as practices that are widely adopted but are less important for the effects we studied. Conclusion. Overall, our survey and the analysis of responses received provide a quantitative basis for assessment and step-wise improvement of practice adoption by ML teams.",0,0,0

"Force-and-moment-based Model Predictive Control for Achieving Highly Dynamic Locomotion on Bipedal Robots
In this paper, we propose a novel framework on force-and-moment-based Model Predictive Control (MPC) for dynamic legged robots. Specifically, we present a formulation of MPC designed for 10 degree-of-freedom (DoF) bipedal robots using simplified rigid body dynamics with input forces and moments. This MPC controller will calculate the optimal inputs applied to the robot, including 3-D forces and 2-D moments at each foot. These desired inputs will then be generated by mapping these forces and moments to motor torques of 5 actuators on each leg. We evaluate our proposed control design on physical simulation of a 10 degree-of-freedom (DoF) bipedal robot. The robot can achieve fast walking speed up to 1.6m/s on rough terrain, with accurate velocity tracking. With the same control framework, our proposed approach can achieve a wide range of dynamic motions including walking, hopping, and running using the same set of control parameters.",0,1,1
"Optimization-Based Trajectory Tracking Approach for Multi-Rotor Aerial Vehicles in Unknown Environments
The goal of this paper is to develop a continuous optimization-based refinement of the reference trajectory to ‘push it out’ of the obstacle-occupied space in the global phase for Multi-rotor Aerial Vehicles in unknown environments. Our proposed approach comprises two planners: a global planner and a local planner. The global planner refines the initial reference trajectory when the trajectory goes either through an obstacle or near an obstacle and lets the local planner calculate a near-optimal control policy. The global planner comprises two convex programming approaches: the first one helps to refine the reference trajectory, and the second one helps to recover the reference trajectory if the first approach fails to refine. The global planner mainly focuses on real-time performance and obstacles avoidance, whereas the proposed formulation of the constrained nonlinear model predictive control-based local planner ensures safety, dynamic feasibility, and the reference trajectory tracking accuracy for low-speed maneuvers, provided that local and global planners have mean computation times 0.06 s (15 Hz) and 0.05 s (20 Hz), respectively, on an NVIDIA Jetson Xavier NX computer. The results of our experiment confirmed that, in cluttered environments, the proposed approach outperformed three other approaches: sampling-based pathfinding followed by trajectory generation, a local planner, and graph-based pathfinding followed by trajectory generation.",0,1,1
"Values of Coordinated Residential Space Heating in Demand Response Provision
Demand side response from space heating in residential buildings can potentially provide huge amount of ﬂexibility for the power system, particularly with deep electriﬁcation of the heat sector. In this context, this paper presents a novel distributed control strategy to coordinate space heating across numerous residential households with diversiﬁed thermal parameters. By employing an iterative algorithm under the game-theoretical framework, each household ad-justs its own heating schedule through demand shift and thermal comfort compensation with the purpose of achieving individual cost savings, whereas the aggregate peak demand is e ﬀ ectively shaved on the system level. Additionally, an innovative thermal comfort model which considers both the temporal and spatial di ﬀ erences in customised thermal comfort requirement is proposed. Through a series of case studies, it is demonstrated that the proposed space heating coordination strategy can facilitate e ﬀ ective energy arbitrage for individual buildings, driving 13.96% reduction in system operational cost and 28.22% peak shaving.

: In this paper, we provide non-averaged and transient performance guarantees for recently developed, tube-based robust economic model predictive control (MPC) schemes. In particular, we consider both tube-based MPC schemes with and without terminal conditions. We show that the closed-loop performance obtained by applying such MPC schemes is approximately optimal when evaluated both on ﬁnite and inﬁnite time horizons. These performance bounds are similar to those derived previously for nominal economic MPC. The theoretical results are discussed in a numerical example.",0,0,1

"Multiscale proper orthogonal decomposition (mPOD) of TR-PIV data—a case study on stationary and transient cylinder wake flows
Data-driven decompositions of particle image velocimetry (PIV) measurements are widely used for a variety of purposes, including the detection of coherent features (e.g. vortical structures), filtering operations (e.g. outlier removal or random noise mitigation), data reduction and compression. This work presents the application of a novel decomposition method, referred to as multiscale proper orthogonal decomposition (mPOD, Mendez et al 2019) to time-resolved PIV (TR-PIV) measurement. This method combines multiresolution analysis and standard proper orthogonal decomposition (POD) to achieve a compromise between decomposition convergence and spectral purity of the resulting modes. The selected test case is the flow past a cylinder in both stationary and transient conditions, producing a frequency-varying Karman vortex street. The results of the mPOD are compared to the standard POD, the discrete Fourier transform and the dynamic mode decomposition. The mPOD is evaluated in terms of decomposition convergence and time-frequency localization of its modes. The multiscale modal analysis allows for revealing beat phenomena in the stationary cylinder wake, due to the three-dimensional nature of the flow, and to correctly identify the transition from various stationary regimes in the transient test case.",0,1,1
"Coordinating Clearance Markdown Sales of Seasonal Products in Retail Chains
In this paper we propose a methodology to set prices of perishable items in the context of a retail chain with coordinated prices among its stores and compare its performance with actual practice in a real case study. We formulate a stochastic dynamic programming problem and develop heuristic solutions that approximate optimal solutions satisfactorily. To compare this methodology with current practices in the industry, we conducted two sets of experiments using the expertise of a product manager of a large retail company in Chile. In the first case, we contrast the performance of the proposed methodology with the revenues obtained during the 1995 autumn-winter season. In the second case, we compare it with the performance of the experienced product manager in a ""simulation-game"" setting. In both cases, our methodology provides significantly better results than those obtained by current practices.",0,1,0
"Dynamic state and parameter estimation in multi-machine power systems - Experimental demonstration using real-world PMU-measurements
—Dynamic state and parameter estimation (DSE) plays a key role for reliably monitoring and operating future, power-electronics-dominated power systems. While DSE is a very active research ﬁeld, experimental applications of proposed algorithms to real-world systems remain scarce. This motivates the present paper, in which we demonstrate the effectiveness of a DSE algorithm previously presented by parts of the authors with real-world data collected by a Phasor Measurement Unit (PMU) at a substation close to a power plant within the extra- high voltage grid of Germany. To this end, at ﬁrst we derive a suitable mapping of the real-world PMU-measurements recorded at a substation close to the power plant to the terminal bus of the power plants’ synchronous generator (SG). This mapping considers the high-voltage (HV) transmission line, the tap-changing transformer and the auxiliary system of the power plant. Next, we introduce several practically motivated extensions to the estimation algorithm, which signiﬁcantly improve its practical performance with real-world measurements. Finally, we successfully validate the algorithm experimentally in an auto- as well as a cross-validation.",0,0,1

We review some features of topology optimization with a lower bound on the critical load factor, as computed by linearized buckling analysis. The change of the optimized design, the competition between stiffness and stability requirements and the activation of several buckling modes, depending on the value of such lower bound, are studied. We also discuss some specific issues which are of particular interest for this problem, as the use of non-conforming finite elements for the analysis, the use of inconsistent sensitivity that may lead to wrong signs of sensitivities and the replacement of the single eigenvalue constraints with an aggregated measure. We discuss the influence of these practices on the optimization result, giving some recommendations.",0,0,1
"Recent advances in robust optimization: An overview
This paper provides an overview of developments in robust optimization since 2007. It seeks to give a representative picture of the research topics most explored in recent years, highlight common themes in the investigations of independent research teams and highlight the contributions of rising as well as established researchers both to the theory of robust optimization and its practice. With respect to the theory of robust optimization, this paper reviews recent results on the cases without and with recourse, i.e., the static and dynamic settings, as well as the connection with stochastic optimization and risk theory, the concept of distributionally robust optimization, and findings in robust nonlinear optimization. With respect to the practice of robust optimization, we consider a broad spectrum of applications, in particular inventory and logistics, finance, revenue management, but also queueing networks, machine learning, energy systems and the public good. Key developments in the period from 2007 to present include: (i) an extensive body of work on robust decision-making under uncertainty with uncertain distributions, i.e., “robustifying” stochastic optimization, (ii) a greater connection with decision sciences by linking uncertainty sets to risk theory, (iii) further results on nonlinear optimization and sequential decision-making and (iv) besides more work on established families of examples such as robust inventory and revenue management, the addition to the robust optimization literature of new application areas, especially energy systems and the public good.",0,0,1
"Decision Rules for Robotic Mobile Fulfillment Systems
The Robotic Mobile Fulfillment Systems (RMFS) is a new type of robotized, parts-to-picker material handling system, designed especially for e-commerce warehouses. Robots bring movable shelves, called pods, to workstations where inventory is put on or removed from the pods. This paper simulates both the pick and replenishment process and studies the order assignment, pod selection and pod storage assignment problems by evaluating multiple decision rules per problem. The discrete event simulation uses realistic robot movements and keeps track of every unit of inventory on every pod. We analyze seven performance measures, e.g. throughput capacity and order due time, and find that the unit throughput is strongly correlated with the other performance measures. We vary the number of robots, the number of pick stations, the number of SKUs (stock keeping units), the order size and whether returns need processing or not. The decision rules for pick order assignment have a strong impact on the unit throughput rate. This is not the case for replenishment order assignment, pod selection and pod storage. Furthermore, for warehouses with a large number of SKUs, more robots are needed for a high unit throughput rate, even if the number of pods and the dimensions of the storage area remain the same. Lastly, processing return orders only affects the unit throughput rate for warehouse with a large number of SKUs and large pick orders.",0,1,0
"A Systematic Review of Productivity Factors in Software Development
Analysing and improving productivity has been one of the main goals of software engineering research since its beginnings. A plethora of studies has been conducted on various factors that resulted in several models for analysis and prediction of productivity. However, productivity is still an issue in current software development and not all factors and their relationships are known. This paper reviews the large body of available literature in order to distill a list of the main factors influencing productivity investigated so far. The measure for importance here is the number of articles a factor is mentioned in. Special consideration is given to soft or human-related factors in software engineering that are often not analysed with equal detail as more technical factors. The resulting list can be used to guide further analysis and as basis for building productivity models.",0,0,0

"Regional Constellation Reconfiguration Problem: Integer Linear Programming Formulation and Lagrangian Heuristic Method
A group of satellites—with either homogeneous or heterogeneous orbital characteristics and/or hardware speciﬁcations—can undertake a reconﬁguration process due to variations in operations pertaining to regional coverage missions. This paper investigates the problem of optimizing a satellite constellation reconﬁguration process against two competing mission objectives: (i) the maximization of the total coverage reward and (ii) the minimization of the total cost of the transfer. The decision variables for the reconﬁguration process include the design of the new conﬁguration and the assignment of satellites from one conﬁguration to another. We present a novel bi-objective integer linear programming formulation that combines constellation design and transfer problems. The formulation lends itself to the use of generic mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) methods such as the branch-and-bound algorithm for the computation of provably-optimal solutions; however, these approaches become computationally prohibitive even for moderately-sized instances. In response to this challenge, this paper proposes a Lagrangian relaxation-based heuristic method that leverages the assignment problem structure embedded in the problem. The results from the computational experiments attest to the near-optimality of the Lagrangian heuristic solutions and signiﬁcant improvement in the computational runtime compared to a commercial MILP solver.",0,0,0
"The Roles of Decision Makers in Special Operations
Abstract : This thesis examines the roles of decision makers in three phases of a special operation: the approval phase, the preparation phase, and the execution phase.

"A Novel Tactile Force Probe for Tissue Stiffness Classification
In this study, we have proposed a new type of tactile sensor that is capable of detecting the stiffness of soft objects. The sensor consists of a brass cylinder with an axial bore. An iron core can easily move inside the bore. Three peripheral bobbins were machined in the cylinder around which three coils have been wound. One of the coils was excited with an alternating current which caused a voltage to be induced in two other coils. A return spring was used to return the core to its initial position after it has been moved. The sensor was pressed against the surface of the object whose stiffness was going to be measured. The position of the core in this state was depended on the stiffness of the given object and the spring constant and was measured by measuring the change in the induced voltage in secondary coils. The proposed sensor was capable of measuring two contact parameters namely the applied force and the stiffness of the object. Using the data of this sensor, three different objects, made of polyurethane, silicon rubber and paraffin gel were discriminated. Thus, this sensor could be used in robot hands and minimally invasive surgery tools to improve their operation.",0,0,1
"A Single Layer S/X-Band Series-Fed Shared Aperture Antenna for SAR Applications
This paper presents our research work on designing a dual-band dual-polarized (DBDP) series-fed S/X-band shared aperture antenna (SAA) for synthetic aperture radar (SAR) applications. The proposed SAA DBDP X-band antenna is designed with the concept of series-fed 4-group 2 × 2 planar arrays with high impedance microstrip line feeding in both vertical and horizontal polarizations. By etching out the inner edge elements from 2 × 2 X-band subarrays in all the four-groups, the Sband element could be accommodated. The design evolution stages have been presented. The S-band (3.2 GHz) is best suited for volumetric soil moisture estimation using SAR and X-band (9.3 GHz) best suited for surveillance SAR applications and grain size estimation. To verify the antenna design concept, a prototype is fabricated and measured with both S-parameters and radiation characteristics including gain measurements. The antenna with reflection coefficient |S11| < −10 dB has an impedance bandwidth 3.12–3.42 GHz (9.3% BW) in S-band and 9.2–9.36 GHz (1.72% BW) in X-band. The measured isolation lS21l between two different bands in the same polarization is better than 25 dB, and the isolation between two different bands in two orthogonal ports is better than 30 dB. Measured gain of the antenna at S-band is better than 8.5 dBi at V-port and H-port, and X-band is better than 11 dBi at either port. Measured side-lobe level (SLL) at S-band is better than −17 dB at either port, and X-Band is better than −20 dB at either port. The overall size of the S/X-DBDP SAA is 100× 100× 1.6mm3. Measured results of the S/X-DBDP SAA show good agreement with the finite integration technique (FIT) based computer simulation technology (CST) microwave studio.",0,1,0
"Personal and Social Usage: The Origins of Active Customers and Ways to Keep Them Engaged
We study how digital service firms can develop an active customer base, focusing on two questions. First, how does the way that customers use the service postadoption to meet their own needs (personal usage) and to interact with one another (social usage) vary across customer acquisition methods? Second, how do firm-to-customer and customer-to-customer communications promote different types of usage? We study these questions using two data sets and by developing a multivariate hierarchical Poisson hidden Markov model (HMM), which fits the data significantly better than univariate and latent class approaches. We indeed find that postadoption behavior varies depending on customer acquisition method and dynamic states. At the total usage level, in one context (an annotation and note-taking service), customers who heard about the service through search and mass-invite exhibited significantly higher usage compared to those who joined through word of mouth (WOM), whereas in another context (a cloud-based file s...",0,0,0
"SSIM-Variation-Based Complexity Optimization for Versatile Video Coding
—To date, Versatile Video Coding (VVC) has a more magniﬁcent overall performance than High Efﬁciency Video Coding (HEVC). The Quadtree with Nested Multi-Type Tree (QTMT) coding block structure can substantially enhance video coding quality in VVC. However, the coding gain also leads to a greater coding complexity. Therefore, this letter proposes a Fast Decision Scheme Based on Structural Similarity Index Metric Variation (FDS-SSIMV) to solve this problem. Firstly, the Struc- tural Similarity Index Metric Variation (SSIMV) characteristic among the sub coding units of the spit mode is illustrated. Next, to evaluate the SSIMV value, SSIMV measure strategies are designed for different split modes in this letter. Then, the desired split modes are selected by the SSIMV values. Experimental results show that the proposed method achieves 64.74% average encoding Time Saving (TS) with a 2.79% Bjøntegaard Delta Bit Rate (BDBR), outperforming the benchmarks.",0,1,0
"Tactile Perception by Electrovibration
One approach to generating realistic haptic feedback on touch screens is electrovibration. In this technique, the friction force is altered via electrostatic forces, which are generated by applying an alternating voltage signal to the conductive layer of a capacitive touchscreen. Although the technology for rendering haptic effects on touch surfaces using electrovibration is already in place, our knowledge of the perception mechanisms behind these effects is limited. This thesis aims to explore the mechanisms underlying haptic perception of electrovibration in two parts. In the first part, the effect of input signal properties on electrovibration perception is investigated. Our findings indicate that the perception of electrovibration stimuli depends on frequency-dependent electrical properties of human skin and human tactile sensitivity. When a voltage signal is applied to a touchscreen, it is filtered electrically by human finger and it generates electrostatic forces in the skin and mechanoreceptors. Depending on the spectral energy content of this electrostatic force signal, different psychophysical channels may be activated. The channel which mediates the detection is determined by the frequency component which has a higher energy than the sensory threshold at that frequency. In the second part, effect of masking on the electrovibration perception is investigated. We show that the detection thresholds are elevated as linear functions of masking levels for simultaneous and pedestal masking. The masking effectiveness is larger for pedestal masking compared to simultaneous masking. Moreover, our results suggest that sharpness perception depends on the local contrast between background and foreground stimuli, which varies as a function of masking amplitude and activation levels of frequency-dependent psychophysical channels.",0,1,1
"An Energy-Saving Snake Locomotion Gait Policy Using Deep Reinforcement Learning
Snake robots, comprised of sequentially connected joint actuators, have recently gained increasing attention in the industrial field, like life detection in narrow space. Such robot can navigate through the complex environment via the cooperation of multiple motors located on the backbone. However, controlling the robots under unknown environment is challenging, and conventional control strategies can be energy inefficient or even fail to navigate to the destination. In this work, a snake locomotion gait policy is developed via deep reinforcement learning (DRL) for energy-efficient control. We apply proximal policy optimization (PPO) to each joint motor parameterized by angular velocity and the DRL agent learns the standard serpenoid curve at each timestep. The robot simulator and task environment are built upon PyBullet. Comparing to conventional control strategies, the snake robots controlled by the trained PPO agent can achieve faster movement and more energy-efficient locomotion gait. This work demonstrates that DRL provides an energy-efficient solution for robot control. 1 ar X iv :2 10 3. 04 51 1v 1 [ cs .L G ] 8 M ar 2 02 1",0,1,1
"Application of Sliding Mode Control Technique to Regulate DC/DC Boost Converters in Systems Exploiting Photovoltaic Power Generation
This paper introduces a new method, called IB-SMC method, to control DC/DC boost converters in systems exploiting photovoltaic power generation. This method combines the sliding mode control technique and iterative-bisectional  technique in the maximum power point tracker to change operations modes of photovoltaic power generation. The IB-SMC controller uses voltage sliding surface to evaluate the relation of instantaneous voltage at the input converter and instantaneous voltage at the maximum power point. Using information about the power of electromagnetic radiation from a pyranometer and temperature from a temperature sensor, the sliding surface and hyteresis band are changed by practically operational conditions that help improving energy efficiency of the process exploiting PVg. Simulations are carried out by Matlab/Simulink that show the ability to ensure dynamic stability by tracking instaneous maximum power point at any time whenever having any change of the operational condition, static stability by maintaining the operation point at maximum power point whenever not have any change of the operational condition and help to bring out approximately absolute energy efficiency.",0,0,1
"An Online De-icing Method Based on Single-Phase Grounding Fault Current for Distribution Lines
Distribution lines can continue to work for a period of time when a single-phase grounding fault occurs in non-effective grounding systems, because the current circulating through the fault point is small. Based on this working characteristic, the single-phase grounding fault current is used to de-icing in this paper. An arc suppression coil inductance set value is calculated by using single-phase ground fault current and load current. Adjusting the arc suppression coil inductance is bigger than or equal to set value. And a single-phase ground fault is set artificially at the end of distribution line, so that the generated fault current is bigger than the critical de-icing current to realize online de-icing without line outage. The novel de-icing method is no need to line outage or special de-icing devices installation and verified high de-icing efficiency, practicability and easily realization by the case analysis.",0,0,1
"Fighting Accounting Fraud Through Forensic Data Analytics
Accounting fraud is a global concern representing a significant threat to the financial system stability due to the resulting diminishing of the market confidence and trust of regulatory authorities. Several tricks can be used to commit accounting fraud, hence the need for non-static regulatory interventions that take into account different fraudulent patterns. Accordingly, this study aims to improve the detection of accounting fraud via the implementation of several machine learning methods to better differentiate between fraud and non-fraud companies, and to further assist the task of examination within the riskier firms by evaluating relevant financial indicators. Out-of-sample results suggest there is a great potential in detecting falsified financial statements through statistical modelling and analysis of publicly available accounting information. The proposed methodology can be of assistance to public auditors and regulatory agencies as it facilitates auditing processes, and supports more targeted and effective examinations of accounting reports.",0,0,0
"Learning quadrupedal locomotion over challenging terrain
A learning-based locomotion controller enables a quadrupedal ANYmal robot to traverse challenging natural environments. Legged locomotion can extend the operational domain of robots to some of the most challenging environments on Earth. However, conventional controllers for legged locomotion are based on elaborate state machines that explicitly trigger the execution of motion primitives and reflexes. These designs have increased in complexity but fallen short of the generality and robustness of animal locomotion. Here, we present a robust controller for blind quadrupedal locomotion in challenging natural environments. Our approach incorporates proprioceptive feedback in locomotion control and demonstrates zero-shot generalization from simulation to natural environments. The controller is trained by reinforcement learning in simulation. The controller is driven by a neural network policy that acts on a stream of proprioceptive signals. The controller retains its robustness under conditions that were never encountered during training: deformable terrains such as mud and snow, dynamic footholds such as rubble, and overground impediments such as thick vegetation and gushing water. The presented work indicates that robust locomotion in natural environments can be achieved by training in simple domains.",0,1,1

"Mechanisms and Attributes of Echo Chambers in Social Media
Echo chambers may exclude social media users from being exposed to other opinions, therefore, can cause rampant negative effects. Among abundant evidence are the 2016 and 2020 US presidential elections conspiracy theories and polarization, as well as the COVID-19 disinfodemic. To help better detect echo chambers and mitigate its negative effects, this paper explores the mechanisms and attributes of echo chambers in social media. In particular, we first illustrate four primary mechanisms related to three main factors: human psychology, social networks, and automatic systems. We then depict common attributes of echo chambers with a focus on the diffusion of misinformation, spreading of conspiracy theory, creation of social trends, political polarization, and emotional contagion of users. We illustrate each mechanism and attribute in a multi-perspective of sociology, psychology, and social computing with recent case studies. Our analysis suggest an emerging need to detect echo chambers and mitigate their negative effects.",0,1,0
"The Level of Satisfaction towards Flood Management System in Kelantan, Malaysia
The community in the Kelantan River Basin is still confronted by the problem of ineffectiveness of flood management system despite the government’s efforts to come up with various approacheson flood management systems to assist flood victims. The main objective of this study is to evaluate the level of residents’ satisfaction towards the implementation of flood management system. This study is quantitatively designed which utilized a questionnaire distributed to 160 respondents selected by stratified cluster simple one-stage sampling technique. The statistical technique used is mean comparison and one-way ANOVA to explain the residents’ perceptions among the districts involved with regards to the efficiency of the implemented flood management system. Based on the outcome of the study, the mean value related to the level of satisfaction of flood victims showed a decreasing pattern from before, during and after flood occurrences. For example, the mean comparative study reveals that the residents of Tanah Merah district recorded the highest dissatisfaction level for the three periods (before 3.04, current 2.95 and after 2.02) in comparision to other districts. The results illustrate a low efficiency level in flood management before flood occurrence. For instance, the community is still not quite satisfied with the effectiveness of warning system, action time intervals and current announcement time intervals regarding latest developments in flood situation with all these variables not achieving significant level of 0.05. The same applies to the situation on after flood effects such as in terms of dispensing flood assistance, controlling of infectious diseases and actions toward each resident’s complaints. Thus, government have to reconsider about the level of residents’ satisfaction to current flood management systems namely before, during and after floods occurrence and systematic planning in flood management",0,0,0

"The benefits of peer transparency in safe workplace operation post pandemic lockdown
The benefits of different levels of engagement with test, trace and isolate procedures are investigated for a pandemic in which there is little population immunity, in terms of productivity and public health. Simple mathematical modelling is used in the context of a single, relatively closed workplace such as a factory or back-office where, in normal operation, each worker has lengthy interactions with a fixed set of colleagues. A discrete-time SEIR model on a fixed interaction graph is simulated with parameters that are motivated by the recent COVID-19 pandemic in the UK during a post-peak phase, including a small risk of viral infection from outside the working environment. Two kinds of worker are assumed, transparents who regularly test, share their results with colleagues and isolate as soon as a contact tests positive for the disease, and opaques who do none of these. Moreover, the simulations are constructed as a ‘playable model’ in which the transparency level, disease parameters and mean interaction degree can be varied by the user. The model is also analysed in the continuum limit. All simulations point to the double benefit of transparency in both maximizing productivity and minimizing overall infection rates. Based on these findings, public policy implications are discussed for how to incentivise this mutually beneficial behaviour in different kinds of workplace, and simple recommendations are made.",0,1,0
"DeepSOCIAL: Social Distancing Monitoring and Infection Risk Assessment in COVID-19 Pandemic
Social distancing is a recommended solution by the World Health Organisation (WHO) to minimise the spread of COVID-19 in public places. The majority of governments and national health authorities have set the 2-meter physical distancing as a mandatory safety measure in shopping centres, schools and other covered areas. In this research, we develop a generic Deep Neural Network-Based model for automated people detection, tracking, and inter-people distances estimation in the crowd, using common CCTV security cameras. The proposed model includes a YOLOv4-based framework and inverse perspective mapping for accurate people detection and social distancing monitoring in challenging conditions, including people occlusion, partial visibility, and lighting variations. We also provide an online risk assessment scheme by statistical analysis of the Spatio-temporal data from the moving trajectories and the rate of social distancing violations. We identify high-risk zones with the highest possibility of virus spread and infections. This may help authorities to redesign the layout of a public place or to take precaution actions to mitigate high-risk zones.

The degree of correlation at the article level within a journal is similar to that at the journal level in the discipline covered by that journal, suggesting that the differences between journals are, to a large extent, discipline specific. Despite the fact that in all studied journals download and citation counts per article positively correlate, little overlap may exist between the set of articles appearing in the top of the citation distribution and that with the most frequently downloaded ones. Usage and citation leaks, bulk downloading, differences between reader and author populations in a subject field, the type of document or its content, differences in obsolescence patterns between downloads and citations, and different functions of reading and citing in the research process all provide possible explanations of differences between download and citation distributions.",0,1,0
"The fourth-order absorbing boundary condition with optimized coefficients for the simulation of the acoustic equation
This paper introduces the fourth-order absorbing boundary condition (ABC) into staggered-grid finite difference forward modeling of the first-order stress–velocity acoustic equation, and develops a new method to optimize coefficients of the fourth-order ABC to further improve its overall absorbing effect. Theoretical analysis and the results of numerical tests demonstrate that the fourth-order ABC with optimized coefficients has much higher absorbing efficiency than both the conventional second-order and fourth-order ABCs without optimized coefficients, for waves with large incident angles. Compared with the perfectly matched layer (PML) with 40 layers, the fourth-order ABC not only has a much better absorbing effect, but also uses far less computer memory for calculation. We present the fourth-order ABC with optimized coefficients as an ideal artificial boundary for the simulation of the acoustic equation based on extensive and complex structure models.",0,0,1
"The Political Economy of Privacy Enhancing Technologies
Privacy Enhancing Technologies (PETs) have increasingly become vital empowering tools in today’s highly datafied society. However, their development has been primarily concerned with improving usability and ensuring confidentiality online. Privileging these considerations might unintendedly lead to fixed ideas about users, but diversity of thought, action, ability, and circumstance play a fundamental role in the distortion and acceptance of any PETs. In this paper we elaborate some of the manifestations of the distortions, like inadequate and exclusory design, and uneven distribution of costs and benefits. Drawing on Amartya Sen’s capability approach we propose that a normative evaluation of personal, social, and political diversities can be used as a foundation to conceptualize and develop PETs. We outline a research agenda based on this proposition and suggest pertinent empirical and methodological research paths. Our contribution offers an evaluative space to make inter-personal comparisons to inform the development of PETs.",0,1,0
"A DC-Autotransformer based Multilevel Inverter for Automotive Applications
This paper proposes a novel multilevel inverter for automotive applications. The topology consists of a modular DCDC converter and a tap selector, where the DC-DC converter provides several DC-output levels and the tap selector produces an AC signal by choosing different DC-output signals from the DC-DC converter. To produce the DC-levels, the DC-DC converter consists of a modular structure where the modules are connected in series. The novelty is that the modules are connected both, magnetically in the AC-domain and electrically in the DCdomain. Due to the usage of low power switches in the modules, the proposed structure provides high efficiency. Furthermore, the DC-DC converter is capable of self-balancing its modules and thus does not require large capacitors which yields a high power density. A prototype of the proposed converter is built and simulation, as well as experimental results, are used to verify the findings.",0,0,1
"Joint radar alignment and odometry calibration
An unsupervised online procedure for the precise alignment of fully integrated Doppler radar sensors is proposed. Alignment is the precise determination of the angle between the principal beam direction of the radar sensor and the thrust axis of the vehicle. The method is based on the accurate determination of the sensor movement through the analysis of the Doppler distribution of stationary targets over the azimuth angle. The precise alignment facilitates estimating the ego motion of the vehicle. The approach is long-term stable and bias free and therefore predestined for the calibration of standard vehicle's odometry (gyroscope and wheel sensors). A hierarchical optimization strategy to obtain the systematic errors is presented and Maximum Likelihood estimators are derived for each step. A Monte-Carlo simulation is used to identify critical impact factors and determine them quantitatively. The performance of all approaches is finally evaluated with promising results using measurements obtained by a pre-series 77 GHz Doppler radar sensor. An alignment precision on the order of 0.01-0.05° is achieved.",0,0,1

"Are Smart Home Devices Abandoning IPV Victims?
Smart home devices have brought us many benefits such as advanced security, convenience, and entertainment. However, these devices also have made unintended consequences like giving ultimate power for devices' owners over their intimate partners in the same household which might lead to tech-facilitated domestic abuse (tech-abuse) as recent research has shown. In this paper, we systematize findings on tech-abuse in smart homes. We show that domestic abuse and Intimate Partner Violence (IPV) in smart homes is more effective and less risky for abusers. Victims find it more harmful and more challenging to protect themselves from. We articulate a comprehensive analysis of all the phases of abuse in smart homes and categorize risks and needs in each phase by designing a unified analytical framework. Technical analysis of current smart home technologies is conducted to shed light upon their limitations. We also summarize recent recommendations to combat tech-abuse in smart homes and focus on their potentials and shortcomings. Unsurprisingly, we find that many recommendations conflict with each other due to a lack of understanding of phases of abuse in smart homes. Desirable properties to design abuse-resistant smart home devices are proposed for all the phases of abuse. The research community benefits from our analysis and recommendations to move forward with a focus on filling the blind spots of existing smart home devices' safety measures and building appropriate safety measures that consider tech-abuse threats in smart homes.",0,0,1
"A new computer-aided tolerance analysis and optimization framework for assembling processes using DP-SDT theory
Tolerance analysis is frequently used in predicting the product quality and balancing the design tolerances in mechanical assemblies. Generally, the tolerance analysis procedure is rather complex and cumbersome, and the existing computer-aided tolerance analysis methods are insufficient in dealing with some assembly information and user-defined quality requirements. This paper presents a new comprehensive tolerance analysis and optimization framework using deviation propagation and small displacement torsor (DP-SDT) theory. In this framework, four modules are designed to model the tolerances, analyze the assembly processes, predict the product quality, and optimize the tolerances respectively. Comparing with the existing methods, this framework can better support the complex assembly information like 3D dimensional tolerances, geometric dimensioning and tolerancing (GD&Ts), different tolerance zones, geometric information, assembly sequence, and various kinds of locating modes. And more practical quality requirements besides the distance precisions can be analyzed. The framework is a helpful supplement in tolerance analysis field. An application prototype using the framework has been developed for SolidWorks, and a tolerance optimization example of lathe saddle is provided to verify the performance of the framework.",0,0,0
"Model-Based Event-Triggered Predictive Control for Networked Systems with Data Dropout
This paper proposes a novel structure of networked control systems (NCSs) with communication logic, which incorporates model-based networked control systems (MB-NCSs), predictive control, and an event-triggered communication scheme into a unified framework to consider the bandwidth reduction of the network communications. Within this framework, first an event-triggered communication scheme at the sensor side is introduced to determine whether or not the sensor measurement should be transmitted to the controller through the imperfect forward paths. Second, at the controller, a model of the plant is used to predict future state behavior of the plant, and based on the predicted state between successful transmission instants, a novel predictive event-triggering scheme is proposed to compress the size of the packetized control signals transmitted from the controller side to the actuator side through feedback paths. Finally, a unified model of NCSs is established. Based on this model, a codesign condition of th...",0,0,1
"Dynamical Analysis of Friction Induced Vibration in a Precision Motion Stage with a Friction Isolator
Motion stages are widely used for precision positioning in manufacturing and metrology applications. However, nonlinear pre-motion friction can significantly affect their control performance and accuracy. This paper analytically studies the dynamical effect of a friction isolator (FI) proposed in previous studies, in which the beneficial effects of FI on improving the robustness, speed, and precision of the system have been experimentally demonstrated. A fundamental understanding of the dynamical effects of FI is achieved by applying linear analysis on a motion stage with and without FI under the effect of LuGre friction dynamics. The systems are studied with the implementation of PID controllers, which, in terms of practicability in motion control, provide more general observations than when only PD is implemented. Parametric analysis is carried out on the effect of control gains, FI design parameters, and LuGre friction parameters to thoroughly observe the eigenvalue and stability characteristics. Numerical simulation is then established to validate the analytical results and demonstrate the interesting dynamical phenomena with the involvement of LuGre friction, PID control, and the friction isolator in the motion stage system. Based on the results, fundamental analytical conclusions about the FI are reached, which also pave the road for future nonlinear studies.",1,1,1
"When Will AI Exceed Human Performance? Evidence from AI Experts

 
 
 
Advances in artificial intelligence (AI) will transform modern life by reshaping transportation, health, science, finance, and the military. To adapt public policy, we need to better anticipate these advances. Here we report the results from a large survey of machine learning researchers on their beliefs about progress in AI. Researchers predict AI will outperform humans in many activities in the next ten years, such as translating languages (by 2024), writing high-school essays (by 2026), driving a truck (by 2027), working in retail (by 2031), writing a bestselling book (by 2049), and working as a surgeon (by 2053). Researchers believe there is a 50% chance of AI outperforming humans in all tasks in 45 years and of automating all human jobs in 120 years, with Asian respondents expecting these dates much sooner than North Americans. These results will inform discussion amongst researchers and policymakers about anticipating and managing trends in AI.

"Single-Sensor RGB and NIR Image Acquisition: Toward Optimal Performance by Taking Account of CFA Pattern, Demosaicking, and Color Correction
In recent years, many applications using a pair of RGB and near-infrared (NIR) images have been proposed in computer vision and image processing communities. Thanks to recent progress of image sensor technology, it is also becoming possible to manufacture an image sensor with a novel spectral filter array, which has RGB plus NIR pixels for one-shot acquisition of the RGB and the NIR images. In such a novel filter array, half of the G pixels in the standard Bayer color filter array (CFA) are typically replaced with the NIR pixels. However, its performance has not fully been investigated in the pipeline of single-sensor RGB and NIR image acquisition. In this paper, we present an imaging pipeline of the single-sensor RGB and NIR image acquisition and investigate its optimal performance by taking account of the filter array pattern, demosaicking and color correction. We also propose two types of filter array patterns and demosaicking algorithms for improving the quality of acquired RGB and NIR images. Based on the imaging pipeline we present, the performance of different filter array patterns and demosaicking algorithms is evaluated. In experimental results, we demonstrate that our proposed filter array patterns and demosaicking algorithms outperform the existing ones. Introduction In recent years, many applications using a pair of RGB and near-infrared (NIR) images have been proposed in computer vision and image processing communities such as image enhancement [1, 2], image fusion [3, 4], dehazing [5, 6], denoising [7, 8], and shadow detection [9]. However, the acquisition of the pair of RGB and NIR images is still a challenging task because existing acquisition systems typically require multiple cameras [1] or multiple shots [9], where one is required for RGB and the other is required for NIR. In current compact and low-cost digital cameras, singlesenor color image acquisition with the Bayer color filter array (CFA) [10], as shown in Fig. 1 (a)-(c), is well established [11]. To simultaneously acquire the RGB and the NIR images, many existing works extend the idea of using the CFA for single-sensor RGB and NIR image acquisition [12–18]. Thanks to recent progress of image sensor technology, it is also becoming possible to manufacture an image sensor with a novel filter array, which has RGB plus NIR pixels [14–18]. This sensor can provide us with a practical solution for one-shot acquisition of the RGB and the NIR images without increased size and cost from current color digital cameras. Hereafter, we call such a filter array “RGB-NIR filter 0 5 10 15 20 25 30 35 40 400 500 600 700 800 90",0,0,1
"A Case Study of the Impediments to the Commercialization of Research at the University of Kentucky.
The commercialization of university-based research occurs to varying degrees between academic institutions. Previous studies have found that multiple barriers can impede the effectiveness and efficiency by which academic research is commercialized. This case study was designed to analyze the status of the commercialization activity at the University of Kentucky via a survey and interview with a successful academic entrepreneur in order to determine the impediments the individual perceived during the commercialization process. The study also garnered insight from the individual as to how the commercialization process could be improved. Issues with infrastructure were highlighted as the most significant barrier faced by the individual. The research subject also suggested that commercialization activity may generally increase if a number of factors were mitigated. Such insight can be communicated to the administrative leadership of the commercialization process at the University of Kentucky.

"Adaptive actuator failure compensation for nonlinear MIMO systems with an aircraft control application
A direct adaptive approach is developed for control of a class of multi-input multi-output (MIMO) nonlinear systems in the presence of uncertain failures of redundant actuators. An adaptive failure compensation controller is designed which is capable of accommodating uncertainties in actuator failure time instants, values and patterns. A realistic situation is studied with fixed grouping of actuators and proportional actuation within actuator groups. The adaptive control system is analyzed, to show its desired stability and asymptotic tracking properties in the presence of actuator failure uncertainties.

"Mechanical design of a compact and dexterous quadruped robot
This manuscript introduced the modularized structural design of a medium sized quadruped robot with desired compact and dexterous mobility. In detail, the ball screw transmission and the four-bar linkages mechanism were adopted to construct the quadruped robot, and then the relationship between the torque of the knee joint and the torque of the motor was modelled and analyzed. Moreover, the mechanical performance of transmission is analyzed, then the practical result indicates that the shank should be configurated to get close as much as possible to the limited position of extension while walking. The loading analysis further showed that the structural strength of each leg is still enough, when adding 200N external force that similar to the whole weight of the robot to one foot. Based on the optimized design, the mechanical prototype was accomplished, and the corresponding control strategy were briefly illustrated. Finally, locomotory planning in typical walking and when the robot falls down were discussed preliminarily.",0,0,1
"From PID to Active Disturbance Rejection Control
Active disturbance rejection control (ADRC) can be summarized as follows: it inherits from proportional-integral-derivative (PID) the quality that makes it such a success: the error driven, rather than model-based, control law; it takes from modern control theory its best offering: the state observer; it embraces the power of nonlinear feedback and puts it to full use; it is a useful digital control technology developed out of an experimental platform rooted in computer simulations. ADRC is made possible only when control is taken as an experimental science, instead of a mathematical one. It is motivated by the ever increasing demands from industry that requires the control technology to move beyond PID, which has dominated the practice for over 80 years. Specifically, there are four areas of weakness in PID that we strive to address: 1) the error computation; 2) noise degradation in the derivative control; 3) oversimplification and the loss of performance in the control law in the form of a linear weighted sum; and 4) complications brought by the integral control. Correspondingly, we propose four distinct measures: 1) a simple differential equation as a transient trajectory generator; 2) a noise-tolerant tracking differentiator; 3) the nonlinear control laws; and 4) the concept and method of total disturbance estimation and rejection. Together, they form a new set of tools and a new way of control design. Times and again in experiments and on factory floors, ADRC proves to be a capable replacement of PID with unmistakable advantage in performance and practicality, providing solutions to pressing engineering problems of today. With the new outlook and possibilities that ADRC represents, we further believe that control engineering may very well break the hold of classical PID and enter a new era, an era that brings back the spirit of innovations.",0,1,1
"Intelligent Systems for Power Load Forecasting: A Study Review
The study of power load forecasting is gaining greater significance nowadays, particularly with the use and integration of renewable power sources and external power stations. Power forecasting is an important task in the planning, control, and operation of utility power systems. In addition, load forecasting (LF) aims to estimate the power or energy needed to meet the required power or energy to supply the specific load. In this article, we introduce, review and compare different power load forecasting techniques. Our goal is to help in the process of explaining the problem of power load forecasting via brief descriptions of the proposed methods applied in the last decade. The study reviews previous research that deals with the design of intelligent systems for power forecasting using various methods. The methods are organized into five groups—Artificial Neural Network (ANN), Support Vector Regression, Decision Tree (DT), Linear Regression (LR), and Fuzzy Sets (FS). This way, the review provides a clear concept of power load forecasting for the purposes of future research and study.",0,0,1
"Automotive Radar Interference Mitigation Using Adaptive Noise Canceller
Interference among frequency modulated continues wave automotive radars can either increase the noise floor, which occurs in the most cases, or generate a ghost target in rare situations. To address the increment of noise floor due to interference, we proposed a low calculation cost method using adaptive noise canceller to increase the signal-to-interference ratio. In a quadrature receiver, the interference in the positive half of frequency spectrum is correlated to that in the negative half of frequency spectrum, whereas the beat frequencies from real targets are always present in the positive frequency. Thus, we estimated the power of the negative frequency as an indication of interference, and fed the positive frequency and negative frequency components into the primary and reference channel of an adaptive noise canceller, respectively. The least mean square algorithm was used to solve for the optimum filter solution. As a result, both the simulation and experiment showed a good interference mitigation performance.",1,1,1
"Continuous-Aperture MIMO for Electromagnetic Information Theory
In recent years, the concept of continuous-aperture MIMO (CAP-MIMO) is reinvestigated to achieve improved communication performance with limited antenna apertures. Unlike the classical MIMO composed of discrete antennas, CAPMIMO has a continuous antenna surface, which is expected to generate any current distribution (i.e., pattern) and induce controllable spatial electromagnetic waves. In this way, the information can be modulated on the electromagnetic waves, which makes it promising to approach the ultimate capacity of finite apertures. The pattern design is the key factor to determine the system performance of CAP-MIMO, but it has not been well studied in the literature. In this paper, we propose the pattern-division multiplexing to design the patterns for CAPMIMO. Specifically, we first derive the system model of a typical CAP-MIMO system, which allows us to formulate the capacity maximization problem. Then we propose a general pattern-division multiplexing technique to transform the design of continuous pattern functions to the design of their projection lengths on finite orthogonal bases, which is able to overcome the design challenge of continuous functions. Based on this technique, we further propose an alternating optimization based pattern design scheme to solve the formulated capacity maximization problem. Simulation results show that, the capacity achieved by the proposed scheme is about 260% higher than that achieved by the benchmark scheme, which demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed pattern-division multiplexing for CAP-MIMO.",0,0,0
"Desire for Data: PornHub and the Platformization of a Culture Industry
That no one pays for their porn anymore has become something of an adage of internet culture, given that seemingly endless porn content now exists on free streaming tubesites. What’s more, the type of pornography content being produced and promoted to users has shifted dramatically in the decade since tubesites first appeared online. In this thesis, I investigate the organizational tactics of one major player in the porn world through the website PornHub.com. As entities like MindGeek (the parent company of PornHub) consolidate media market control in an oligopolistic mode, they also gain influence over what types of pornography can be made profitable. A scarcity of data surrounding privately held porn companies further complicates the study of this supply chain. Using a blend of pornography and platform studies, and by way of a digital walkthrough method, I will overcome the opacity that surrounds PornHub to make their organizational choices clear. By analyzing the operations and strategic choices of the platform, this project will reveal ways in which the platform manages user attention and renders porn media production contingent to their operations.",0,0,0
"Integration of Ground Penetrating Radar and Infrared Thermography for Bridge Deck Condition Evaluation
Ground Penetrating Radar (GPR) and Infrared Thermography (IR) have been applied separately by several agencies as tools for bridge deck condition assessment, but there is limited reported work describing the combined use of the results of these two methods. The work described in this paper demonstrates how these two technologies can be economically combined using a multi-level survey approach. The work was carried out on 87 bridge decks in Wisconsin, and included IR and GPR data collection, under-deck visual surveys, and selective core sampling. A Level 1 analysis was initially conducted to screen out decks in good condition, and to focus more detailed (Level 2) analysis on decks that would most likely be programmed for future maintenance and rehabilitation. The strengths and limitations of each method were considered in carrying out the data analysis. The paper describes the methodology, the equipment used, the field data collection, the analysis methods, and the integration of results obtained from the two types of surveys.",0,1,1
"79 GHz-Band High-Resolution Millimeter-Wave Radar
High-resolution millimeter-wave radar that operates in the 79 GHz band is expected to achieve a significant increase in the distance resolution of radar systems because of the availability of a wide frequency bandwidth of 4 GHz as compared with 0.5 GHz of the existing 77 GHz-band millimeter-wave radar. For this reason, it has the potential to distinguish between a vehicle and a human, which was conventionally difficult, and recognize their movements. Therefore it raises expectations for use as a surrounding monitoring radar in driving safety support and automatic driving. As one of FUJITSU TEN’s efforts regarding sensing technologies for driving safety support and automatic driving, it has been developing 79 GHz-band high-resolution millimeterwave radar. This paper presents specifications of radar for application to systems that assist in safe driving and automatic driving and the results of testing a prototype for a wider bandwidth that is required to accomplish the technology’s purpose. This radar increases the ability to detect a pedestrian in the surroundings of a vehicle, which was difficult to do with the existing 77 GHz-band radar. Furthermore, this paper also describes how the newly developed radar offers the possibility of improving the performance of a sensor for automatic driving and systems to assist in safe driving.",0,0,0

"3-D Underactuated Bipedal Walking via H-LIP Based Gait Synthesis and Stepping Stabilization
In this article, we holistically present a hybrid-linear inverted pendulum (H-LIP) based approach for synthesizing and stabilizing 3-D foot-underactuated bipedal walking, with an emphasis on thorough hardware realization. The H-LIP is proposed to capture the essential components of the underactuated and actuated part of the robotic walking. The robot walking gait is then directly synthesized based on the H-LIP. We comprehensively characterize the periodic orbits of the H-LIP and provably derive the stepping stabilization via its step-to-step (S2S) dynamics, which is then utilized to approximate the S2S dynamics of the horizontal state of the center of mass of the robotic walking. The approximation facilities a H-LIP based stepping controller to provide desired step sizes to stabilize the robotic walking. By realizing the desired step sizes, the robot achieves dynamic and stable walking. The approach is fully evaluated in both simulation and experiment on the 3-D underactuated bipedal robot Cassie, which demonstrates dynamic walking behaviors with both high versatility and robustness.",1,1,1
"Convex Relaxations of Chance Constrained AC Optimal Power Flow
High penetration of renewable energy sources and the increasing share of stochastic loads require the explicit representation of uncertainty in tools such as the optimal power flow (OPF). Current approaches follow either a linearized approach or an iterative approximation of nonlinearities. This paper proposes a semidefinite relaxation of a chance-constrained AC-OPF, which is able to provide guarantees for global optimality. Using a piecewise affine policy, we can ensure tractability, accurately model large power deviations, and determine suitable corrective control policies for active power, reactive power, and voltage. We state a tractable formulation for two types of uncertainty sets. Using a scenario-based approach and making no prior assumptions about the probability distribution of the forecast errors, we obtain a robust formulation for a rectangular uncertainty set. Alternatively, assuming a Gaussian distribution of the forecast errors, we propose an analytical reformulation of the chance constraints suitable for semidefinite programming. We demonstrate the performance of our approach on the IEEE 24 and 118 bus system using realistic day-ahead forecast data and obtain tight near-global optimality guarantees.",0,0,1

"BDANet: Multiscale Convolutional Neural Network With Cross-Directional Attention for Building Damage Assessment From Satellite Images
Fast and effective responses are required when a natural disaster (e.g., earthquake and hurricane) strikes. Building damage assessment from satellite imagery is critical before relief effort is deployed. With a pair of predisaster and postdisaster satellite images, building damage assessment aims at predicting the extent of damage to buildings. With the powerful ability of feature representation, deep neural networks have been successfully applied to building damage assessment. Most existing works simply concatenate predisaster and postdisaster images as input of a deep neural network without considering their correlations. In this article, we propose a novel two-stage convolutional neural network for building damage assessment, called BDANet. In the first stage, a U-Net is used to extract the locations of buildings. Then, the network weights from the first stage are shared in the second stage for building damage assessment. In the second stage, a two-branch multiscale U-Net is employed as the backbone, where predisaster and postdisaster images are fed into the network separately. A cross-directional attention module is proposed to explore the correlations between predisaster and postdisaster images. Moreover, CutMix data augmentation is exploited to tackle the challenge of difficult classes. The proposed method achieves state-of-the-art performance on a large-scale dataset—xBD.

"A Case Study of Onboarding in Software Teams: Tasks and Strategies
Developers frequently move into new teams or environments across software companies. Their onboarding experience is correlated with productivity, job satisfaction, and other short-term and long-term outcomes. The majority of the onboarding process comprises engineering tasks such as fixing bugs or implementing small features. Nevertheless, we do not have a systematic view of how tasks influence onboarding. In this paper, we present a case study of Microsoft, where we interviewed 32 developers moving into a new team and 15 engineering managers onboarding a new developer into their team – to understand and characterize developers' onboarding experience and expectations in relation to the tasks performed by them while onboarding. We present how tasks interact with new developers through three representative themes: learning, confidence building, and socialization. We also discuss three onboarding strategies as inferred from the interviews that managers commonly use unknowingly, and discuss their pros and cons and offer situational recommendations. Furthermore, we triangulate our interview findings with a developer survey (N = 189) and a manager survey (N = 37) and find that survey results suggest that our findings are representative and our recommendations are actionable. Practitioners could use our findings to improve their onboarding processes, while researchers could find new research directions from this study to advance the understanding of developer onboarding.

"Optimised Informed RRTs for Mobile Robot Path Planning
Path planners based on basic rapidly-exploring random trees (RRTs) are quick and efficient, and thus favourable for real-time robot path planning, but are almost-surely suboptimal. In contrast, the optimal RRT (RRT*) converges to the optimal solution, but may be expensive in practice. Recent work has focused on accelerating the RRT*'s convergence rate. The most successful strategies are informed sampling, path optimisation, and a combination thereof. However, these acceleration methods have not been applied to the basic RRT. Moreover, while a number of path optimisers can be used to accelerate the convergence rate, a comparison of their effectiveness is lacking. In this paper, we investigate the use of informed sampling and path optimisation to accelerate planners based on both the basic RRT and the RRT*, resulting in a family of algorithms known as optimised informed RRTs. We apply different path optimisers and compare their effectiveness. The goal is to ascertain if applying informed sampling and path optimisation can help the quick, though almost-surely suboptimal, path planners based on the basic RRT attain comparable or better performance than RRT*-based planners. Analyses show that RRT-based optimised informed RRTs do attain better performance than their RRT*-based counterparts, both when planning time is limited and when there is more planning time.",0,1,0
"Simulation of unsteady blood flows in a patient‐specific compliant pulmonary artery with a highly parallel monolithically coupled fluid‐structure interaction algorithm
Computational fluid dynamics (CFD) is increasingly used to study blood flows in patient‐specific arteries for understanding certain cardiovascular diseases. The techniques work quite well for relatively simple problems but need improvements when the problems become harder when (a) the geometry becomes complex (eg, a few branches to a full pulmonary artery), (b) the model becomes more complex (eg, fluid‐only to coupled fluid‐structure interaction), (c) both the fluid and wall models become highly nonlinear, and (d) the computer on which we run the simulation is a supercomputer with tens of thousands of processor cores. To push the limit of CFD in all four fronts, in this paper, we develop and study a highly parallel algorithm for solving a monolithically coupled fluid‐structure system for the modeling of the interaction of the blood flow and the arterial wall. As a case study, we consider a patient‐specific, full size pulmonary artery obtained from computed tomography (CT) images, with an artificially added layer of wall with a fixed thickness. The fluid is modeled with a system of incompressible Navier‐Stokes equations, and the wall is modeled by a geometrically nonlinear elasticity equation. As far as we know, this is the first time the unsteady blood flow in a full pulmonary artery is simulated without assuming a rigid wall. The proposed numerical algorithm and software scale well beyond 10 000 processor cores on a supercomputer for solving the fluid‐structure interaction problem discretized with a stabilized finite element method in space and an implicit scheme in time involving hundreds of millions of unknowns.",0,1,1
"Feature-Level Rating System Using Customer Reviews and Review Votes
This work studies how we can obtain feature-level ratings of the mobile products from the customer reviews and review votes to influence decision-making, both for new customers and manufacturers. Such a rating system gives a more comprehensive picture of the product than what a product-level rating system offers. While product-level ratings are too generic, feature-level ratings are particular; we exactly know what is good or bad about the product. There has always been a need to know which features fall short or are doing well according to the customer’s perception. It keeps both the manufacturer and the customer well-informed in the decisions to make in improving the product and buying, respectively. Different customers are interested in different features. Thus, feature-level ratings can make buying decisions personalized. We analyze the customer reviews collected on an online shopping site (Amazon) about various mobile products and the review votes. Explicitly, we carry out a feature-focused sentiment analysis for this purpose. Eventually, our analysis yields ratings to 108 features for 4000+ mobiles sold online. It helps in decision-making on how to improve the product (from the manufacturer’s perspective) and in making the personalized buying decisions (from the buyer’s perspective) a possibility. Our analysis has applications in recommender systems, consumer research, and so on.",0,0,0
"Don't ""research fast and break things"": On the ethics of Computational Social Science
As a quintessential social impact science, Computational Social Science (CSS) holds great promise to advance social justice, human flourishing, and biospheric sustainability. However, CSS is also an all-too-human science—conceived in particular social, cultural, and historical contexts and pursued amidst intractable power imbalances, structural inequities, and potential conflicts of interest. Its proponents must thus remain continuously self-critical about the role that values, interests, and power dynamics play in shaping mission-driven research. Likewise, they must take heed of the complicated social and historical conditions surrounding the generation and construction of data as well as the way that the activities and theories of CSS researchers can function to restructure and shape the phenomena that they purport only to measure and analyse. This article is concerned with setting up practical guardrails within the research activities and environments of CSS in response to these dilemmas. It aims to provide CSS scholars, as well as policymakers and other stakeholders who apply CSS methods, with the critical and constructive means needed to ensure that their practices are ethical, trustworthy, and responsible. It begins by providing a taxonomy of the ethical challenges faced by researchers in the field of CSS. These are challenges related to (1) the treatment of research subjects, (2) the impacts of CSS research on affected individuals and communities, (3) the quality of CSS research and to its epistemological status, (4) research integrity, and (5) research equity. Taking these challenges as a motivation for cultural transformation, it then argues for the end-to-end incorporation of habits of responsible research and innovation (RRI) into CSS practices, focusing on the role that contextual considerations, anticipatory reflection, impact assessment, public engagement, and justifiable and well-documented action should play across the research lifecycle. In proposing the inclusion of habits of RRI in CSS practices, the chapter lays out several practical steps needed for ethical, trustworthy, and responsible CSS research activities. These include stakeholder engagement processes, research impact assessments, data lifecycle documentation, bias self-assessments, and transparent research reporting protocols.

"Robust Power Scheduling for Microgrids with Uncertainty in Renewable Energy Generation
Arobust power scheduling algorithm is proposed to schedule power flow between the main electricity grid and a microgird with solar energy generation and battery energy storage subject to uncertainty in solar energy production. To avoid over-conservatism in power scheduling while guaranteeing robustness against uncertainties, time-varying “soft” constraints on the State of Charge (SoC) of the battery are proposed. These soft constraints allow SoC limit violation at steps far from the current step but aim to minimize such violations in a controlled manner. The model predictive formulation of the problem over a receding time horizon ensures that the resulting solution eventually conforms to the hard SoC limits of the system at every step. The optimization problem for each step is formulated as a quadratic programming problem that is solved iteratively to find the soft constraints that are closest to the hard ones and still yield a feasible solution. Optimization results demonstrate the effectiveness of the approach.",0,1,1
"A model of reactive settling of activated sludge: comparison with experimental data
A non-negligible part of the biological reactions in the activated sludge process for treatment of wastewater takes place in secondary settling tanks that follow biological reactors. It is therefore of interest to develop models of so-called reactive settling that describe the spatial variability of reaction rates caused by the variation of local concentration of biomass due to hindered settling and compression. A reactive-settling model described by a system of nonlinear partial diﬀerential equations and a numerical scheme are introduced for the simulation of hindered settling of ﬂocculated particles, compression at high concentrations, dispersion of the ﬂocculated particles in the suspension, dispersion of the dissolved substrates in the ﬂuid, and the mixing that occurs near the feed inlet. The model is ﬁtted to experiments from a pilot plant where the sedimentation tank has a varying cross-sectional area. For the reactions, a modiﬁed version of the activated sludge model no. 1 (ASM1) is used with standard coeﬃcients. The constitutive functions for hindered settling and compression are adjusted to a series of conventional batch settling experiments after the initial induction period of turbulence and reﬂocculation has been transformed away. Further (but not substantial) improvements of prediction of experimental steady-state scenarios can be achieved by also ﬁtting additional terms modelling hydrodynamic dispersion.",0,0,1
"Noise Reduction with Optimal Variable Span Linear Filters
In this paper, the problem of noise reduction is addressed as a linear filtering problem in a novel way by using concepts from subspace-based enhancement methods, resulting in variable span linear filters. This is done by forming the filter coefficients as linear combinations of a number of eigenvectors stemming from a joint diagonalization of the covariance matrices of the signal of interest and the noise. The resulting filters are flexible in that it is possible to trade off distortion of the desired signal for improved noise reduction. This tradeoff is controlled by the number of eigenvectors included in forming the filter. Using these concepts, a number of different filter designs are considered, like minimum distortion, Wiener, maximum SNR, and tradeoff filters. Interestingly, all these can be expressed as special cases of variable span filters. We also derive expressions for the speech distortion and noise reduction of the various filter designs. Moreover, we consider an alternative approach, wherein the filter is designed for extracting an estimate of the noise signal, which can then be extracted from the observed signals, which is referred to as the indirect approach. Simulations demonstrate the advantages and properties of the variable span filter designs, and their potential performance gain compared to widely used speech enhancement methods.",0,1,1
"Eliminating Peak Impact Forces by Customizing the Passive Foot Dynamics of Legged Robots

 Impact forces are a destructive, yet common occurrence in legged locomotion. Every step produces a collision when the leg’s inertia immediately stops upon ground contact. This results in peak impact forces and high frequency vibrations that resonate through the system, damage components, and complicate control algorithms. Rubber or other damping material is the assumed solution for mitigating these impacts. However, we show the benefit of using foot springs where both stiffness and maximum compression are customized to the leg. Such springs eliminate peak impact forces by gradually bringing the leg’s inertia to rest. The maximum compression point (i.e. a hard stop) then provides a rigid surface during stance. We provide a methodology for designing this passive dynamic foot that is validated through simulation and physical testing. Our results show this methodology reduces rigid body impacts and foot vibrations in a way traditional methods, reliant upon rubber or damping, are yet to achieve.",0,0,1
"Characterization of GPS Carrier Phase Multipath
GPS carrier phase measurements are affected by multipath signals that can significantly affect the quality of data used for static and kinematic positioning applications. It is generally difficult to characterize this multipath using field data whereby the exact sources of the errors cannot be easily isolated. In this paper, carrier phase multipath parameters are identified and their influences on measurements are investigated through a theoretical analysis. Multipath effects are analyzed from a geometrical perspective whereby GPS signals are assumed to propagate through the advancement of a plane wavefront on which the phase of the GPS signals is the same. The differential path delay of the reflected signal with respect to the direct signal is then calculated. A multipath simulation model is developed and described wherein the multipath parameters can be varied and their influences observed. These parameters include i) the reflection coefficient, ii) the antenna to reflector distance, iii) the azimuth and elevation of the reflected signal iv) the existence of multiple reflectors, and v) satellite dynamics. Mulipath characteristics such as frequency, error envelope, spatial correlation, and signal to noise 34 ratio are studied by varying these parameters. Only the specular component is addressed in this paper as the diffused component is random in nature and difficult to model in a deterministic form. INTRODUCTION GPS carrier phase multipath errors have assumed importance due to the high accuracy demands in a number of applications. The differential carrier phase measurement is invariably used in high precision applications like static and kinematic surveying and attitude determination (e.g. Axalrad et al., 1994). Most of the errors in the carrier phase measurements, such as atmospheric delays, orbital and clock errors are spatially correlated and generally cancel through the differencing process for short baselines. However, carrier phase multipath is a highly localized error which does not cancel through differencing and therefore has been identified as the major source of error in many high precision applications (Braasch, 1996). Several techniques have been developed to counter carrier phase multipath either using improved receiver hardware (Townsend et al., 1995; Garin and Rousseau, 1997) or data processing techniques (Axelrad et al., 1994; Moelker, 1997; Ray et al., 1998). Townsend et al. (1995) used the MEDLL technique whereas Garin and Rousseau (1997) used the Advanced Strobe Correlator to reduce the effect of carrier phase multipath. Axalrad et al. (1994) and Sleewaegen (1997) have exploited the signal-to-noise (SNR) information from the receiver in post mission, along with the antenna gain patterns, to estimate multipath. Moelker (1997) used a direction finding algorithm (e.g. MUSIC) with a MEDLL receiver to counter multipath. Ray et al. (1998) used the spatial correlation of the multipath error between multiple closely-spaced antennas that can be used in real time at a reference station. For successful isolation and mitigation of this error, it is important to understand the cause of the multipath and its",0,0,0
"Numerical simulation of flow over flapping wings in tandem: Wingspan effects
We report direct numerical simulations of a pair of wings in horizontal tandem configuration, to analyze the effect of their aspect ratio on the flow and the aerodynamic performance of the system. The wings are immersed in a uniform free-stream at Reynolds number Re = 1000, and they undergo heaving and pitching oscillation with Strouhal number St = 0.7. The aspect ratios of forewing and hindwing vary between 2 and 4. The aerodynamic performance of the system is dictated by the interaction between the trailing edge vortex (TEV) shed by the forewing and the induced leading edge vortex formed on the hindwing. The aerodynamic performance of the forewing is similar to that of an isolated wing irrespective of the aspect ratio of the hindwing, with a small modulating effect produced by the forewing-hindwing interactions. On the other hand, the aerodynamic performance of the hindwing is clearly affected by the interaction with the forewing’s TEV. Tandem configurations with a larger aspect ratio on the forewing than on the hindwing result in a quasi-two-dimensional flow structure on the latter. This yields an 8% increase in the time-averaged thrust coefficient of the hindwing, with no change in its propulsive efficiency.",0,1,1

"Learning-Based Model Predictive Control: Toward Safe Learning in Control
Recent successes in the field of machine learning, as well as the availability of increased sensing and computational capabilities in modern control systems, have led to a growing interest in learning and data-driven control techniques. Model predictive control (MPC), as the prime methodology for constrained control, offers a significant opportunity to exploit the abundance of data in a reliable manner, particularly while taking safety constraints into account. This review aims at summarizing and categorizing previous research on learning-based MPC, i.e., the integration or combination of MPC with learning methods, for which we consider three main categories. Most of the research addresses learning for automatic improvement of the prediction model from recorded data. There is, however, also an increasing interest in techniques to infer the parameterization of the MPC controller, i.e., the cost and constraints, that lead to the best closed-loop performance. Finally, we discuss concepts that leverage MPC to augment learning-based controllers with constraint satisfaction properties.",0,1,1
"Heuristic decision making.
As reflected in the amount of controversy, few areas in psychology have undergone such dramatic conceptual changes in the past decade as the emerging science of heuristics. Heuristics are efficient cognitive processes, conscious or unconscious, that ignore part of the information. Because using heuristics saves effort, the classical view has been that heuristic decisions imply greater errors than do ""rational"" decisions as defined by logic or statistical models. However, for many decisions, the assumptions of rational models are not met, and it is an empirical rather than an a priori issue how well cognitive heuristics function in an uncertain world. To answer both the descriptive question (""Which heuristics do people use in which situations?"") and the prescriptive question (""When should people rely on a given heuristic rather than a complex strategy to make better judgments?""), formal models are indispensable. We review research that tests formal models of heuristic inference, including in business organizations, health care, and legal institutions. This research indicates that (a) individuals and organizations often rely on simple heuristics in an adaptive way, and (b) ignoring part of the information can lead to more accurate judgments than weighting and adding all information, for instance for low predictability and small samples. The big future challenge is to develop a systematic theory of the building blocks of heuristics as well as the core capacities and environmental structures these exploit.",0,1,0
"An Alternative to IEEE 802.11ba: Wake-Up Radio With Legacy IEEE 802.11 Transmitters
Current standardization process for Wake-up Radio (WuR) within the IEEE 802.11 Working Group, known as the IEEE 802.11ba, has brought interest to the IEEE 802.11-related technologies for the implementation of WuR systems. This paper proposes a new WuR system, where the Wake-up Transmitter (WuTx) is based on the legacy IEEE 802.11 Orthogonal Frequency Division Modulation (OFDM) Physical Layer (PHY) specification. Using the IEEE 802.11, OFDM PHY makes it possible for an IEEE 802.11a/g/n/ac transmitter to operate as WuTx for this WuR system. The WuTx generates a Wake-up Signal (WuS) coded with an amplitude-based digital modulation, achieving a bit rate of 250 kbps. This modulation, which we call Peak-Flat modulation, can be received using low-power receivers. A simulated proof of concept of the WuTx based on the IEEE 802.11g is presented and evaluated using MATLAB WLAN Toolbox. A method to generate the Peak-Flat modulated WuS from an IEEE 802.11a/g standard-compliant transmitter, using only software-level access, is explained. In addition, two possible low-power Wake-up Receiver (WuRx) architectures capable of decoding the presented modulation are proposed. The design of those receivers is generic enough to be used as a reference to compare the performance of the Peak-Flat Modulation with the other state-of-the-art approaches. The evaluation results conclude that the Peak-Flat modulation has similar performance compared to the other IEEE 802.11 WuR solutions on the reference receivers. Moreover, this solution provides a notorious advantage: legacy OFDM-based IEEE 802.11 transmitters can generate the Peak-Flat modulated WuS.",0,1,0

"Reproduction simulation of emergency brake fault feature for subway train
The working principle of emergency braking loop and the characteristics of emergency pneumatic braking system for subway train were introduced.The diagnostic rules of the faults of emergency electromagnetic valve were provided based on comprehensive braking command and volume-chamber pressure of relay valve.Three kinds of fault characteristics for emergency electromagnetic valve are analyzed respectively corresponding to three kinds of cases,in which emergency brake was invalid with emergency braking command,emergency brake occurred without emergency braking command and volume-chamber pressure of relay valve was abnormal without emergency braking command.The detailed process of fault diagnosis for emergency electromagnetic valve was analyzed.The pneumatic braking system model was set up by using AMESim,three types of faults were simulated based on fault reappearance method,and the contrast test of the first type fault was conducted on the pneumatic control test bed.Test result shows that in triggering the emergency braking signal under normal condition,the volumechamber pressure delays 1.1sand reaches its goal.Under artificially disconnecting the signal wire of emergency electromagnetic valve and triggering the emergency braking signal,thevolume-chamber pressure is zero and remains unchanged.After 2.6s,the system alarms the faults of emergency braking electromagnetic valve.So,the braking system model can effectively represent the emergency braking fault features,the fault feature identification method is feasible based on braking command and volume-chamber pressure of relay valve,and it can be used for emergency braking fault's on-line monitoring and service status tracking.13 figs,20refs.",0,1,1
"A FRAMEWORK FOR MEASURING CONSTRUCTION PROJECT PERFORMANCE: OVERCOMING KEY CHALLENGES OF PERFORMANCE MEASUREMENT
Performance in the construction project context, and the need for its measurement are examined in this review of literature. It is shown that despite the inherent benefits of performance measurement in helping identify unnecessary causes of waste so that remedial actions can be taken, performance measurement is not extensively implemented because of the inadequacy of measures, complexity of measurement, time consuming and costly nature of performance measurement, and project-oriented nature of the industry. Where performance measurement is implemented, various frameworks are available, some targeting project performance whilst others focus on overall business performance. The criteria for these various frameworks are contrasted and assessed in terms of their suitability for on-going research into the impact of organisational culture on construction project performance. Following this assessment, the key requirements of suitable performance measures and measurement frameworks are identified as including, having a few but relevant measures, being linked with critical project objectives, providing accurate information, and comprising financial and non-financial measures. It is argued that a ‘one-fits-all’ approach in performance measurement is non-existent, and that measures chosen must align with the purpose of the measurement – in this case, the need to investigate the impact of organisational culture. On the basis of these arguments, an approach for identifying performance measures in this research is proposed.",0,1,0

"Characterization of electrowetting actuation on addressable single-side coplanar electrodes
This paper studies and characterizes electrowetting-on-dielectric (EWOD) actuations on coplanar electrodes with an electrode-free cover plate or no cover plate. By arranging driving and reference electrodes on one plate, such an EWOD configuration can accommodate more sensing mechanisms from above and thus allows increased flexibility for system development. Various coplanar electrodes are tested for contact angle changes by EWOD with a focus on the effect of the percentage gap between electrodes and are found to be in good agreement with a simple analytical model. The droplet-moving devices demonstrate the successful moving, cutting and merging of droplets (∼0.1 µl) in a parallel-plate configuration, i.e., between the driving plate with coplanar electrodes and the passive plate with no electrode.

"Modal-based Kinematics and Contact Detection of Soft Robots
Soft robots offer an alternative approach to manipulate within a constrained space while maintaining a safe interaction with the external environment. Owing to its adaptable compliance characteristic, external contact force can easily deform the robot shapes and lead to undesired robot kinematic and dynamic properties. Accurate contact detection and contact location estimation are of critical importance for soft robot modeling, control, trajectory planning, and eventually affect the success of task completion. In this article, we focus on the investigation of a one degree of freedom (1-DoF) soft pneumatic bending robot, which is regarded as one of the fundamental components to construct complex, multi-DoFs soft robots. This 1-DoF soft robot is modeled through the integral representation of the spatial curve, where direct and instantaneous kinematics are calculated explicitly through a modal method. The fixed centrode deviation method is used to detect the external contact and estimate the contact location. Simulation results and experimental studies indicate that the contact location can be accurately estimated by solving a nonlinear least-square optimization problem. Experimental validation shows that the proposed algorithm is able to successfully estimate the contact location with the estimation error of 1.46 mm.",0,1,1
"Prediction of aerodynamic flow fields using convolutional neural networks
An approximation model based on convolutional neural networks (CNNs) is proposed for flow field predictions. The CNN is used to predict the velocity and pressure field in unseen flow conditions and geometries given the pixelated shape of the object. In particular, we consider Reynolds Averaged Navier–Stokes (RANS) flow solutions over airfoil shapes as training data. The CNN can automatically detect essential features with minimal human supervision and is shown to effectively estimate the velocity and pressure field orders of magnitude faster than the RANS solver, making it possible to study the impact of the airfoil shape and operating conditions on the aerodynamic forces and the flow field in near-real time. The use of specific convolution operations, parameter sharing, and gradient sharpening are shown to enhance the predictive capabilities of the CNN. We explore the network architecture and its effectiveness in predicting the flow field for different airfoil shapes, angles of attack, and Reynolds numbers.",0,0,1
"Models to consider load-sharing in reliability calculation and simulation of systems consisting of mechanical components
The load-sharing case occurs in systems, if a load is shared by several components. Then the failure of a component results in a higher load share for the surviving components. This paper places emphasis on the analytic description of systems with load-sharing, the algebraic calculation and the simulative solution of their reliability. The capacity flow model, the Freund model and the state-graph method are presented as models for the analytic description. The state-graph method is the most general model: systems with individual failure behavior of the components, individual load steps as well as complex system structures can be considered. All three models are restricted to components with constant failure rates in the corresponding load level. However, in most mechanical systems the failure rates of components are not constant due to aging and wear-out. A more adequate method for the load-sharing case in mechanical systems is the application of simulation techniques. In this paper the general simulation algorithms are presented for 1-out-of-n systems consisting of components with constant failure rates and of components with time-dependent failure rates. In the case of constant failure rates, the failure times in the load levels can be sampled directly from the failure distributions due to the memory-less property of the exponential distribution. The simulation results are shown for both a 1-out-of-2 and a 1-out-of-3 system. For verification purpose the results of the simulation are compared with the analytic solution of the Freund model. In the case of time-dependent failure rates a dynamic modification of the failure distribution of the components is necessary. This is done by a time shift of the distributions and transformed random numbers. The simulation results are presented for a 1-out-of-2 and a 1-out-of-3 system. The failure behavior of the mechanical components is described by a Weibull distribution in each load level. In order to verify the simulation results the analytic bounds of the corresponding system with no increased load and maximum load are calculated.",0,0,1
"Hardware and Software Development of an Open Source Battery Management System
In order to guarantee adequate operating conditions in an energy storage system (SAE), extending its useful life, and offering safety to the user, a device known as the battery management system (BMS) is used. Most devices currently sold are restricted to operating characteristics of lithium battery technologies, which are different in different ways from the operation of other types of batteries that are studied and developed in laboratories. The restriction of use in other technologies could be circumvented through open platforms, allowing modifications in the BMS in order to adapt to the application technology. This adaptive characteristic is rarely found in commercialized devices, being fundamental when the objective of the BMS is linked to academic research that requires experimental steps. Therefore, this work proposes a low cost adaptive open source BMS prototype, capable of monitoring the variables of voltage, current, temperature and state of charge for a battery with up to 10 cells in series. The development includes hardware and software for the basic functioning of BMS functions. The proposed BMS was developed based on two cell technologies with: 18650 lithium ions, and sodium nickel chloride. The versatility of BMS in operating on these two technologies aims to demonstrate the adaptive capacity of the system.

"Unscented Kalman filter (UKF)–based nonlinear parameter estimation for a turbulent boundary layer: a data assimilation framework
A turbulent boundary layer is a ubiquitous element of fundamental and applied fluid mechanics. Unfortunately, accurate measurements of turbulent boundary layer parameters (e.g. friction velocity uτ and wall shear τw) are challenging, especially for high-speed flows (Smits et al ). Many direct and/or indirect diagnostic techniques have been developed to measure wall shear stress (Vinuesa et al ). However, based on various principles, these techniques generally give different results with varying uncertainties. The current study introduces a nonlinear data assimilation framework based on the unscented Kalman filter (UKF) that can fuse information from (i) noisy and discretized measurements from stereo particle image velocimetry (SPIV), a Preston tube, and a MEMS shear stress sensor, as well as (ii) the uncertainties of the measurements to estimate the parameters of a turbulent boundary layer. A direct numerical simulation of a fully developed turbulent channel flow is used first to validate the data assimilation algorithm. The algorithm is then applied to experimental boundary layer data at Mach 0.3 obtained in a blowdown wind tunnel facility. Drag coefficients from control volume analysis of the SPIV and wall pressure data and laser interferometer skin friction measurements are used for independent cross-validation. The UKF-based data assimilation algorithm is robust to the uncertain and discretized experimental data and is able to provide accurate estimates of turbulent boundary layer parameters with quantified uncertainty.",0,0,1
"Time series forecasting of solar power generation for large-scale photovoltaic plants
Abstract Accurate solar power forecasting is essential for grid-connected photovoltaic (PV) systems especially in case of fluctuating environmental conditions. The prediction of PV power output is critical to secure grid operation, scheduling and grid energy management. One of the key elements in PV output prediction is time series analysis especially in locations where the historical solar radiation measurements or other weather parameters have not been recorded. In this work, several time series prediction methods including the statistical methods and those based on artificial intelligence are introduced and compared rigorously for PV power output prediction. Moreover, the effect of prediction time horizon variation for all the algorithms is investigated. Hourly solar power forecasting is carried out to verify the effectiveness of different models.

"Dynamic Walk of a Biped
The authors have developed five kinds of biped locomotive robots so far. They are named BIPER-1, 2, 3, 4, and 5. All of them are statically unstable but can perform a dynamically stable walk with suitable control. BIPER-1 and BIPER-2 walk only sideways. BIPER-3 is a stilt-type robot whose foot contacts occur at a point and who can walk sideways, back ward, and forward. BIPER-4's legs have the same degrees of freedom as human legs. BIPER-5 is similar to BIPER-3, but in the case of BIPER-5 all apparatus, such as the computer, are mounted on it. This paper deals with the control theory used for BIPER-3 and BIPER-4. In both cases, basically the same control method is applied.

"Modeling Ground-to-Air Path Loss for Millimeter Wave UAV Networks
Path loss is a significant component of wireless communication channel design and analysis and reflects the reduction in a transmitted signal’s power density. Due to the differences in the propagation conditions, wireless aerial channels’ features differ from those of terrestrial wireless channels; therefore, unmanned aerial vehicle path loss models are often different from conventional terrestrial wireless channel path loss models. A mathematical propagation model is proposed in this paper to estimate the Ground-to-Air path loss between a wireless device and a low-altitude platform using the frequency bands of the millimeter wave. The suggested model of Ground-to-Air path loss will assist academic researchers in formulating several vital problems.",0,0,0
"Robust Model Predictive Path Integral Control: Analysis and Performance Guarantees
In this letter we propose a novel decision making architecture for Robust Model-Predictive Path Integral Control (RMPPI) and investigate its performance guarantees and applicability to off-road navigation. Key building blocks of the proposed architecture are an augmented state space representation of the system consisting of nominal and actual dynamics, a placeholder for different types of tracking controllers, a safety logic for nominal state propagation, and an importance sampling scheme that takes into account the capabilities of the underlying tracking control. Using these ingredients, we derive a bound on the free energy growth of the dynamical system which is a function of task constraint satisfaction level, the performance of the underlying tracking controller, and the sampling error of the stochastic optimization used within RMPPI. To validate the bound on free energy growth, we perform experiments in simulation using two types of tracking controllers, namely the iterative Linear Quadratic Gaussian and Contraction-Metric based control. We further demonstrate the applicability of RMPPI in real hardware using the GT AutoRally vehicle. Our experiments demonstrate that RMPPI outperforms MPPI and Tube-MPPI by alleviating issues of the aforementioned model predictive controllers related to either lack of robustness or excessive conservatism. RMPPI provides the best of the two worlds in terms of agility and robustness to disturbances.",1,1,1

"Comparison of Ballistic-Coefficient-Based Estimation Algorithms for Precise Tracking of a Re-Entry Vehicle and its Impact Point Prediction
This paper studies the problem of tracking a re-entry vehicle (RV) in order to predict its impact point on the ground. Reentry target dynamics combined with super-high speed has a complex non-linearity due to ballistic coefficient variations. However, it is difficult to construct a database for the ballistic coefficient of a unknown vehicle for a wide range of variations, thus the reliability of target tracking performance cannot be guaranteed if accurate ballistic coefficient estimation is not achieved. Various techniques for ballistic coefficient estimation have been previously proposed, but limitations exist for the estimation of non-linear parts accurately without obtaining prior information. In this paper we propose the ballistic coefficient β model-based interacting multiple model-extended Kalman filter ( β-IMM-EKF) for precise tracking of an RV. To evaluate the performance, other ballistic coefficient model based filters, which are gamma augmented filter, gamma bootstrapped filter were compared and assessed with the proposed β-IMM-EKF for precise tracking of an RV.",0,0,1
"The Who in Explainable AI: How AI Background Shapes Perceptions of AI Explanations
Explainability of AI systems is critical for users to take informed actions and hold systems accountable. While “opening the opaque box” is important, understanding who opens the box can govern if the Human-AI interaction is effective. In this paper, we conduct a mixed-methods study of how two different groups of whos—people with and without a background in AI—perceive different types of AI explanations. These groups were chosen to look at how disparities in AI backgrounds can exacerbate the creator-consumer gap. We quantitatively share what the perceptions are along five dimensions: confidence, intelligence, understandability, second chance, and friendliness. Qualitatively, we highlight how the AI background influences each group’s interpretations and elucidate why the differences might exist through the lenses of appropriation and cognitive heuristics. We find that (1) both groups had unwarranted faith in numbers, to different extents and for different reasons, (2) each group found explanatory values in different explanations that went beyond the usage we designed them for, and (3) each group had different requirements of what counts as humanlike explanations. Using our findings, we discuss potential negative consequences such as harmful manipulation of user trust and propose design interventions to mitigate them. By bringing conscious awareness to how and why AI backgrounds shape perceptions of potential creators and consumers in XAI, our work takes a formative step in advancing a pluralistic Human-centered Explainable AI discourse.",0,0,0

"Monolayer MoS2 Strained to 1.3% With a Microelectromechanical System
We report on a modified transfer technique for atomically thin materials integrated into microelectromechanical systems (MEMS) for studying strain physics and creating strain-based devices. Our method tolerates the non-planar structures and fragility of MEMS while still providing precise positioning and crack-free transfer of flakes. Furthermore, our method used the transfer polymer to anchor the 2D crystal to the MEMS, which reduces the fabrication time and increases the yield, and allowed us to exploit the strong mechanical coupling between the 2D crystal and polymer to strain the atomically thin system. We successfully strained single atomic layers of molybdenum disulfide (MoS2) with MEMS devices for the first time and achieved greater than 1.3% strain, marking a major milestone for incorporating 2D materials with MEMS. We used the established strain response of MoS2 Raman and photoluminescence spectra to deduce the strain in our crystals and provide a consistency check. We found good comparison between our experiment and the literature. [2018-0144]",0,0,1
"Design And Analysis Of Three-Output Open Differential with 3-DOF
This paper presents a novel passive three-output differential with three degrees of freedom (3DOF), that translates motion and torque from a single input to three outputs. The proposed ThreeOutput Open Differential is designed such that its functioning is analogous to the functioning of a traditional two-output open differential. That is, the differential translates equal motion and torque to all its three outputs when the outputs are unconstrained or are subjected to equivalent load conditions. The introduced design is the first differential with three outputs to realise this outcome. The differential action between the three outputs is realised passively by a symmetric arrangement of three two-output open differentials and three two-input open differentials. The resulting differential mechanism achieves the novel result of equivalent input to output angular velocity and torque relations for all its three outputs. Furthermore, Three-Output Open Differential achieves the novel result for differentials with more than two outputs where each of its outputs shares equivalent angular velocity and torque relations with all the other outputs. The kinematics and dynamics of the Three-Output Open Differential are derived using the bond graph method. In addition, the merits of the differential mechanism along with its current and potential applications are presented.",0,0,1

"Models for the elastic deformation of honeycombs
A theoretical model has been developed for predicting the elastic constants of honeycombs based on the deformation of the honeycomb cells by hexme, stretching and hinging. This is an extension of earlier work based on flexure alone. The model has been used to derive expressions for the tensile moduli, shear moduli and Poisson’s ratios. Examples are given of structures with a negative Poisson’s ratio. It is shown how the properties can be tailored by varying the relative magnitudes of the force constants for the different deformation mechanisms. Off-axis elastic constants are also calculated and it is shown how the moduli and Poisson’s ratios vary with applied loading direction. Depending on the geometry of the honeycomb the properties may be isotropic (for regular hexagons) or extremely anisotropic. Again, the degree of anisotropy is also affected by the relative magnitude of the force constants for the three deformation mechanisms. 0 1997 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.",0,1,1
"Exoskeleton robot control for synchronous walking assistance in repetitive manual handling works based on dual unscented Kalman filter
Prolong walking is a notable risk factor for work-related lower-limb disorders (WRLLD) in industries such as agriculture, construction, service profession, healthcare and retail works. It is one of the common causes of lower limb fatigue or muscular exhaustion leading to poor balance and fall. Exoskeleton technology is seen as a modern strategy to assist worker’s in these professions to minimize or eliminate the risk of WRLLDs. Exoskeleton has potentials to benefit workers in prolong walking (amongst others) by augmenting their strength, increasing their endurance, and minimizing high muscular activation, resulting in overall work efficiency and productivity. Controlling exoskeleton to achieve this purpose for able-bodied personnel without impeding their natural movement is, however, challenging. In this study, we propose a control strategy that integrates a Dual Unscented Kalman Filter (DUKF) for trajectory generation/prediction of the spatio-temporal features of human walking (i.e. joint position, and velocity, and acceleration) and an impedance cum supervisory controller to enable the exoskeleton to follow this trajectory to synchronize with the human walking. Experiment is conducted with four subjects carrying a load and walking at their normal speed- a typical scenario in industries. EMG signals taken at two muscles: Right Vastus Intermedius (on the thigh) and Right Gastrocnemius (on the calf) indicated reduction in muscular activation during the experiment. The results also show the ability of the control system to predict spatio-temporal features of the pilots’ walking and to enable the exoskeleton to move in concert with the pilot.",0,0,1
"A Benchmark Test Suite for the Electric Capacitated Vehicle Routing Problem
Severa1 logistic companies started utilizing electric vehicles (EVs) in their daily operations to reduce greenhouse gas pollution. However, the limited driving range of EVs may require visits to recharging stations during their operation. These potential visits have to be addressed, avoiding unnecessary long detours. We formulate the electric capacitated vehicle routing problem (E-CVRP), which incorporates the possibility of EVs visiting a recharging station while satisfying the delivery demands of customers. The energy consumption of the EVs is proportional to their cargo load which is an important constraint in real-world logistics applications. A new set of benchmark instances is proposed for the E-CVRP. As solution methods to these new benchmarks, we apply the ant colony optimization metaheuristic method and an exact method. Experimental results on the ECVRP demonstrate the high complexity of the problem and the efficiency of the applied metaheuristic solution method.",0,1,1

"Rate-Splitting Multiple Access for Dual-Functional Radar-Communication Satellite Systems
In this paper, we consider a multi-antenna dual-functional radar-communication (DFRC) satellite system, where the satellite has a dual capability to simultaneously communicate with downlink satellite users (SUs) and probe detection signals to a moving target. To design an appropriate DFRC waveform, we investigate the rate-splitting multiple access (RSMA)-assisted DFRC beamfoming, and employ the Cramér-Rao bound (CRB) as a radar performance metric, which represents a lower bound on the variance of unbiased estimators. The beamforming is optimized to minimize the CRB subject to quality of service (QoS) constraints of SUs and a per-feed transmit power budget. Satellite communication and detecting ground/ sea objects in a bistatic mode are accomplished simultaneously using the DFRC waveform we designed. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed RSMA-assisted DFRC beamforming outperforms the conventional space-division multiple access (SDMA) strategy in terms of the communication-sensing trade-off and target estimation performance in a multibeam satellite system.",0,0,0
"Blind and Neural Network-Guided Convolutional Beamformer for Joint Denoising, Dereverberation, and Source Separation
This paper proposes an approach for optimizing a Convolutional BeamFormer (CBF) that can jointly perform denoising (DN), dereverberation (DR), and source separation (SS). First, we develop a blind CBF optimization algorithm that requires no prior information on the sources or the room acoustics, by extending a conventional joint DR and SS method. For making the optimization computationally tractable, we incorporate two techniques into the approach: the Source-Wise Factorization (SW-Fact) of a CBF and the Independent Vector Extraction (IVE). To further improve the performance, we develop a method that integrates a neural network (NN) based source power spectra estimation with CBF optimization by an inverse-Gamma prior. Experiments using noisy reverberant mixtures reveal that our proposed method with both blind and NN-guided scenarios greatly outperforms the conventional state-of-the-art NN-supported mask-based CBF in terms of the improvement in automatic speech recognition and signal distortion reduction performance.",0,0,1
"Non-Stationarities in Extra-Large-Scale Massive MIMO
Massive MIMO, a key technology for increasing area spectral efficiency in cellular systems, was developed assuming moderately sized apertures. In this article, we argue that massive MIMO systems behave differently in large-scale regimes due to spatial non-stationarity. In the large-scale regime, with arrays of around 50 wavelengths, the terminals see the whole array but non-stationarities occur because different regions of the array see different propagation paths. At even larger dimensions, which we call the extra-large scale regime, terminals see a portion of the array and inside the first type of non-stationarities might occur. We show that the non-stationarity properties of the massive MIMO channel change several important MIMO design aspects. In simulations, we demonstrate how non-stationarity is a curse when neglected but a blessing when embraced in terms of computational load and multi-user transceiver design.",0,1,0
"Joint time difference of arrival/angle of arrival position finding in passive radar
Several target position finding methods are proposed in various papers mainly regarding sensor networks. However, the problem of position finding in passive radar systems is somewhat different from the general case of sensor networks. Generally, in a passive radar system, there are few receivers located at short distances when compared with the it distance from the target. In this case, a problem known as geometric dilution of precision (GDP) occurs, which considerably increases the error of many proposed methods. This phenomenon can even make the position finding equations non-solvable. Regarding this fact, we have developed a least mean square error (LMSE) based method, which uses both the angle of arrival (AOA) and time difference of arrival (TDOA) measurements to estimate almost precisely the position of very distant targets in a passive radar system. A simple equation is derived here to compare the TDOA and AOA accuracies. Then, it is shown that whenever the accuracies of these two measurements are comparable, the proposed method estimates the target position more precisely than the conventional AOA-only and TDOA-only methods. It also avoids the non-convergence behaviour encountered in TDOA-only methods.",0,1,0
"Optimal production control in a discrete manufacturing system with unreliable machines and random demands
We consider a production control problem in a manufacturing system with a failure-prone machine and a stochastic demand. The objective is to minimize a discounted inventory holding and backlog cost over an infinite planning horizon. The optimal production control of continuous, stochastic manufacturing systems with a failure-prone machine and a constant demand has been considered in Akella and Kumar (1986). However, the problem of optimal production control for discrete stochastic manufacturing systems with uncertain demands remains open. In this paper, we investigate a case where the exogenous demand forms a homogeneous Poisson flow. Primarily, we show that the optimal production control for such a system is of the threshold control type. In addition, the explicit form of production control policy and the objective functions are provided. Numerical examples are included to demonstrate the results obtained in the paper and to compare with the one in Akella and Kumar.",0,1,0
"pymgrid: An Open-Source Python Microgrid Simulator for Applied Artificial Intelligence Research
Microgrids, self contained electrical grids that are capable of disconnecting from the main grid, hold potential in both tackling climate change mitigation via reducing CO2 emissions and adaptation by increasing infrastructure resiliency.

"Nonlinear finite element analysis of lattice core sandwich beams
Abstract A displacement-based, geometrically nonlinear finite element model is developed for lattice core sandwich panels modeled as 2-D equivalent single-layer (ESL), first-order shear deformation theory (FSDT) micropolar plates. The nonlinearity is due to the moderate macrorotations of the plate which are modeled by including the von Karman nonlinear strains in the micropolar strain measures. Weak-form Galerkin formulation with linear Lagrange interpolations is used to develop the displacement finite element model. Selective reduced integration is used to eliminate shear locking and membrane locking. The novel finite element model is used to study the nonlinear bending and linear free vibrations of web-core and pyramid core sandwich panels. Clamped and free edge boundary conditions are considered for the first time for the 2-D micropolar ESL-FSDT plate theory. The present 2-D finite element results are in good agreement with the corresponding detailed 3-D FE results for the lattice core sandwich panels. The 2-D element provides computationally cost-effective solutions; in a nonlinear bending example, the number of elements required for the 2-D micropolar plate is of the order 1 0 3 , whereas for the corresponding 3-D model the order is 1 0 5 .",0,0,1
"Trajectory Generation using Sharpness Continuous Dubins-like Paths with Applications in Control of Heavy-Duty Vehicles
We present a trajectory generation framework for control of wheeled vehicles under steering actuator constraints. The motivation is smooth driving of autonomous heavy-duty vehicles, which are characterized by slow actuator dynamics. In order to deal with the slow dynamics, we take into account rate and, additionally, torque limitations of the steering actuator directly. Previous methods only take into account limitations in the path curvature, which deals indirectly with steering rate limitations. We propose the new concept of Sharpness Continuous curves, which uses cubic curvature paths together with circular arcs to steer the vehicle. The obtained paths are characterized by a smooth and continuously differentiable steering angle profile. The final trajectories computed with our method provide low-level controllers with reference signals which are easier to track, resulting in improved performance. The smoothness of the obtained steering profiles also results in increased passenger comfort. The method is characterized by fast computation times. We detail possible path planning applications of the method, and conduct simulations that show its advantages and real-time capabilities.",0,1,1
"Revisiting Few-sample BERT Fine-tuning
We study the problem of few-sample fine-tuning of BERT contextual representations, and identify three sub-optimal choices in current, broadly adopted practices. First, we observe that the omission of the gradient bias correction in the BERTAdam optimizer results in fine-tuning instability. We also find that parts of the BERT network provide a detrimental starting point for fine-tuning, and simply re-initializing these layers speeds up learning and improves performance. Finally, we study the effect of training time, and observe that commonly used recipes often do not allocate sufficient time for training. In light of these findings, we re-visit recently proposed methods to improve few-sample fine-tuning with BERT and re-evaluate their effectiveness. Generally, we observe a decrease in their relative impact when modifying the fine-tuning process based on our findings.",0,1,0
"Design and Evaluation of an Invariant Extended Kalman Filter for Trunk Motion Estimation With Sensor Misalignment
Understanding human motion is of critical importance for health monitoring and control of assistive robots, yet many human kinematic variables cannot be directly or accurately measured by wearable sensors. In recent years, invariant extended Kalman filtering (InEKF) has shown a great potential in nonlinear state estimation, but its applications to human poses new challenges, including imperfect placement of wearable sensors and inaccurate measurement models. To address these challenges, this article proposes an augmented InEKF design which considers the misalignment of the inertial sensor at the trunk as part of the states and preserves the group affine property for the process model. Personalized lower-extremity forward kinematic models are built and employed as the measurement model for the augmented InEKF. Observability analysis for the new InEKF design is presented. The filter is evaluated with three subjects in squatting, rolling-foot walking, and ladder-climbing motions. Experimental results validate the superior performance of the proposed InEKF over the state-of-the-art InEKF. Improved accuracy and faster convergence in estimating the velocity and orientation of human, in all three motions, are achieved despite the significant initial estimation errors and the uncertainties associated with the forward kinematic measurement model.",1,1,1

"Spatio-Temporal Failure Propagation in Cyber-Physical Power Systems
Cascading failure in power systems is triggered by a small perturbation that leads to a sequence of failures spreading through the system. The interconnection between different components in a power system causes failures to easily propagate across the system. The situation gets worse by considering the interconnection between cyber and physical layers in power systems. A plethora of work has studied the cascading failure in power systems to calculate its impact on the system. Understanding how failures propagate into the system in time and space can help the system operator to take preventive actions and upgrade the system accordingly. Due to the nonlinearity of the power flow equation as well as the engineering constraints in the power system, it is essential to understand the spatio-temporal failure propagation in cyber-physical power systems (CPPS). This paper proposes an asynchronous algorithm for investigating failure propagation in CPPS. The physics of the power system is addressed by the full AC power flow equations. Various practical constraints including load shedding, load-generation balance, and island operation are considered to address practical constraints in power system operation. The propagation of various random initial attacks of different sizes is analyzed and visualized to elaborate on the applicability of the proposed approach. Our findings shed light on the cascading failure evolution in CPPS.",0,0,1

"On the shape of air–liquid interfaces with surface tension that bound rigidly rotating liquids in partially filled containers
The interface shape of a fluid in rigid body rotation about its axis and partially filling the container is often the subject of a homework problem in the first graduate fluids class. In that problem, surface tension is neglected, the interface shape is parabolic and the contact angle boundary condition is not satisfied in general. When surface tension is accounted for, the shapes exhibit much richer dependencies as a function of rotation velocity. We analyze steady interface shapes in rotating right-circular cylindrical containers under rigid body rotation in zero gravity. We pay especial attention to shapes near criticality, in which the interface, or part thereof, becomes straight and parallel to the axis of rotation at certain specific rotational speeds. We examine geometries where the container is axially infinite and derive properties of their solutions. We then examine in detail two special cases of menisci in a cylindrical container: a meniscus spanning the cross section; and a meniscus forming a bubble. In each case we develop exact solutions for the respective axial lengths as infinite series in powers of appropriate rotation parameters; and we find the respective asymptotic behaviors as the shapes approach their critical configuration. Finally we apply the method of asymptotic approximants to yield analytical expressions for the axial lengths of menisci over the whole range of rotation speeds. In this application, the analytical solution is employed to examine errors introduced by the assumption that the interface is a right circular cylinder; this assumption is key to the spinning bubble method used to measure surface tension.",0,0,1
"A multidimensional conception and measure of human-robot trust
Abstract Robots are increasingly used in social applications, which raise challenges regarding people's trust in robots. A modern conception of human-robot trust must go beyond the conventional notions of human-automation relations and better connect to the current understanding of human-human trust, without assuming that human-robot trust is identical. A review of the literature together with our recent empirical work suggests that trust is multidimensional, incorporating both performance aspects (central in the human-automation literature) and moral aspects (central in the human-human trust literature). A multidimensional conception can be applied to human-robot trust, even if only some of the dimensions will be relevant for any given interaction with a robot. In addition to proposing an integrative conception of trust, we offer a measurement instrument for public use: the Multidimensional Measure of Trust (MDMT). This measure captures two superordinate factors of trust (Performance trust, Moral trust) that each break into two subfacets (Reliable and Capable within Performance, and Sincere and Ethical within Moral). We are continuing to test this measure in follow-up research and encourage other researchers to join us in collectively validating it.",0,0,0

"Enhancing the online decision-making process by using augmented reality: A two country comparison of youth markets
Although online stores extend the traditional offer of the brick and mortar ones, the limited possibilities to virtually try the product before the effective buying makes the online purchase decision a complex process for consumers.

The present study investigates the effect of augmented reality technologies on consumer behaviour within the online retail environments, by comparing two different cultural settings. Drawing upon the technology acceptance model (TAM), new constructs related to the technology characteristics (e.g. quality of information, aesthetic quality, interactivity, and response time) developed a new conceptual model. This model has been tested for a new technology for virtual try-on (a smart mirror for virtual glasses). Focusing on young consumers, data collected in Italy and Germany yielding a total of 318 participants was used. Findings across these two markets reflect cross-market similarities, but also dissimilarities, related to consumersâ€™ motivation to employ augmented reality systems for supporting their online purchase decision. These insights should prove helpful to retailers in better manage the online channels, that could be easily extended to the mobile one.",0,1,0
"A Weak Moving Point Target Detection Method Based on High Frame Rate Image Sequences
The detection of moving point target is fairly difficult, especially when the imagery distance is so far that the target only occupies one pixel in the image. Under this condition, the signal to noise ratio (SNR) is extremely low and the target is almost submerged by noise, all those bring huge difficulty for the detection. This paper presents a new method for the detection of dim point moving targets from high frame rate image sequence based on kernel theory. In our method, the problem is modeled to detect a weak signal of unknown scale and arrival time from cluttered backgrounds. Such SNR of target signal is extremely low, so de-noising pretreatment is very necessary. A new de-noising method for impact signal based on wavelet packet transform and kurtosis is also proposed. Then our method is applied in detecting weak moving point target from image sequences which are collected by a high-speed camera. In order to verify the performance of proposed method, the comparisons with traditional detection methods are provided. The experimental results show that the proposed method has great superiority in moving point target detection.",0,0,1
"Propagation Measurement System and Approach at 140 GHz-Moving to 6G and Above 100 GHz
With the relatively recent realization that millimeter wave frequencies are viable for mobile communications, extensive measurements and research have been conducted on frequencies from 0.5 to 100 GHz, and several global wireless standard bodies have proposed channel models for frequencies below 100 GHz. Presently, little is known about the radio channel above 100 GHz where there are much wider unused bandwidth slots available. This paper summarizes wireless communication research and activities above 100 GHz, overviews the results of previously published propagation measurements at D-band (110–170 GHz), provides the design of a 140 GHz wideband channel sounder system, and proposes indoor wideband propagation measurements and penetration measurements for common materials at 140 GHz which were not previously investigated.",0,0,0
"Incremental value modeling
INTRODUCTION In many one-to-one marketing situations the marketer is interested in identifying prospects/customers (hereinafter referred to simply as customers) she can profitably influence through a direct marketing contact. Since direct marketing often is just one of several ongoing marketing/advertising programs, many customers make purchases from the company whether they receive direct communications or not. The problem at hand then is which individuals should the company contact, so that the return on the direct marketing investment exceeds the company’s hurdle rate for such investments. Rather than have a separate hurdle rate for justifying marketing investments, many companies use the hurdle rate used to make all capital investment decisions. This typically is the firm’s cost of capital. The situation described above is endemic to many CRM (Customer Relationship Management) modeling applications:",0,1,0

"Estimating Industrial Building Energy Savings using Inverse Simulation
Estimating energy savings from retrofitting existing building systems is traditionally a time intensive process, accomplished by developing a detailed building simulation model, running the model with actual weather data, calibrating the model to actual energy use data, modifying the model to include the proposed changes, then running the base and proposed models with typical weather data to estimate typical energy savings. This paper describes a less time-intensive method of estimating energy savings in industrial buildings using actual monthly energy consumption and weather data. The method begins by developing a multivariate three-parameter changepoint regression model of facility energy use. Next, the change in model parameters is estimated to reflect the proposed energy saving measure. Energy savings are then estimated as the difference between the base and proposed models driven with typical weather data. Use of this method eliminates the need for estimating building parameters, system performance, and operating practices since they are included in the inverse simulation model. It also eliminates the need for model calibration since the inverse model is derived from actual energy use data. The paper describes the development of statistical inverse energy signature models and how to modify the models to estimate savings. Expected savings from inverse simulation are compared to savings predicted by detailed hourly simulation, and sources of error are discussed. Finally, the method is demonstrated in a case study example from the industrial sector. Limitations of the approach for complex building systems and the uncertainty of estimated savings are discussed.",0,1,1
"A cross-country study on cultural similarities based on book preferences
What people choose to read is believed to be highly influenced by their cultural backgrounds and environment. Thus, understanding the cultural and socioeconomic factors that have significant relations with the reading preferences of nations can be of great importance for the book retail industry. These insights can have applications in recommender systems, sales predictions, and customer relationship management. Motivated by these values, we conducted a large-scale cross-country analysis of cultural similarities and differences based on book preferences using data collected from Goodreads.

"A Review Of Microstrip Patch Antenna Design At 28 Ghz For 5G Applications System
The mobile technology is fast-developing nowadays owing to its large impact on social life. Accordingly, there is a need to study the progress of the antenna systems as they are considered as core devices for wireless technology. The modern antenna designs allow a single element to be employed in many systems. The microstrip patch antennas are essentially considered in the advancement of the latest communication mechanisms in contrast to the conventional type because they offer the advantage of being low profile along with simple or inexpensive manufacturing procedures.

"A Transactive Energy Market Framework Considering Network Constraints and Fairness
The continuous penetration of distributed energy resources (DER) in the electric power grid is driving a new paradigm shift towards transactive energy system (TES), an active and more sustainable system characterized by distributed generation and energy exchanges among consumers and producers in the network. This transition, however, comes with challenges such as dealing with the nonlinear and non-convex power flows of the system, determining an optimal transaction price to maximize overall system welfare, and ensuring fairness for all participants. In this paper, we propose a three-stage transactive energy framework that aims to address these challenges. In the first stage, the cost without trading is calculated which will serve as the reference in the profit maximization problem in the next stage. DER dispatch, power flows and initial transaction payments/incentives of the participants will then be determined in the second stage. A benefit allocation algorithm is applied in the third control stage to determine the optimal transaction price and final payments/incentives that will ensure fairness for trading participants. The proposed framework was tested in an IEEE 33bus system and results show that fair benefits are given for all participants during trading and the system operates within the network and economic constraints.",1,1,1

"Continuous control of an underground loader using deep reinforcement learning
The reinforcement learning control of an underground loader was investigated in a simulated environment by using a multi-agent deep neural network approach. At the start of each loading cycle, one agent selects the dig position from a depth camera image of a pile of fragmented rock. A second agent is responsible for continuous control of the vehicle, with the goal of filling the bucket at the selected loading point while avoiding collisions, getting stuck, or losing ground traction. This relies on motion and force sensors, as well as on a camera and lidar. Using a soft actor–critic algorithm, the agents learn policies for efficient bucket filling over many subsequent loading cycles, with a clear ability to adapt to the changing environment. The best results—on average, 75% of the max capacity—were obtained when including a penalty for energy usage in the reward.",0,1,1
"Condition monitoring of a complex hydraulic system using multivariate statistics
In this paper, a systematic approach for the automated training of condition monitoring systems for complex hydraulic systems is developed and evaluated. We analyzed different fault scenarios using a test rig that allows simulating a reversible degradation of component's conditions. By analyzing the correlation of features extracted from raw sensor data and the known fault characteristics of experimental obtained data, the most significant features specific to a fault case can be identified. These feature values are transferred to a lower-dimensional discriminant space using linear discriminant analysis (LDA) which allows the classification of fault condition and grade of severity. We successfully implemented and tested the system for a fixed working cycle of the hydraulic system. Furthermore, the classification rate for random load cycles was enhanced by a distribution analysis of feature trends.",0,1,1
"AlignGraph2: similar genome-assisted reassembly pipeline for PacBio long reads
Contigs assembled from the third-generation sequencing long reads are usually more complete than the second-generation short reads. However, the current algorithms still have difficulty in assembling the long reads into the ideal complete and accurate genome, or the theoretical best result [1]. To improve the long read contigs and with more and more fully sequenced genomes available, it could still be possible to use the similar genome-assisted reassembly method [2], which was initially proposed for the short reads making use of a closely related genome (similar genome) to the sequencing genome (target genome). The method aligns the contigs and reads to the similar genome, and then extends and refines the aligned contigs with the aligned reads. Here, we introduce AlignGraph2, a similar genome-assisted reassembly pipeline for the PacBio long reads. The AlignGraph2 pipeline is the second version of AlignGraph algorithm proposed by us but completely redesigned, can be inputted with either error-prone or HiFi long reads, and contains four novel algorithms: similarity-aware alignment algorithm and alignment filtration algorithm for alignment of the long reads and preassembled contigs to the similar genome, and reassembly algorithm and weight-adjusted consensus algorithm for extension and refinement of the preassembled contigs. In our performance tests on both error-prone and HiFi long reads, AlignGraph2 can align 5.7-27.2% more long reads and 7.3-56.0% more bases than some current alignment algorithm and is more efficient or comparable to the others. For contigs assembled with various de novo algorithms and aligned to similar genomes (aligned contigs), AlignGraph2 can extend 8.7-94.7% of them (extendable contigs), and obtain contigs of 7.0-249.6% larger N50 value and 5.2-87.7% smaller number of indels per 100 kbp (extended contigs). With genomes of decreased similarities, AlignGraph2 also has relatively stable performance.

"Generative Adversarial Networks for Real-time Stability of Inverter-based Systems
In islanded systems with droop-controlled sources, the droop coefficients need to be tuned in real-time using supervisory control to maintain asymptotic stability. In contrast to offline tuning methods, online domain-of-stability estimation yields non-conservative droop gains in real-time, ensuring good power sharing performance as the operating point varies. The challenge in the conventional online domain-of-stability estimation process is its unscalability and high computational complexity. In this paper, an efficient alternative using conditional Generative Adversarial Networks (cGANs) is described. We demonstrate that the notion of power system stability can be learned by such deep neural networks, and that they can offer a scalable alternative to conventional domain-of-stability estimation methods in islanded distribution systems. The implementation of cGANs-based stability assessment is described for an LV distribution test case and its advantages demonstrated.",0,1,1
"A New Application of Chaos Game Optimization Algorithm for Parameters Extraction of Three Diode Photovoltaic Model
The precision of the PV model greatly influences the simulation results to enhance the effectiveness of photovoltaic (PV) energy systems. The PV mathematical model is based on a remarkably nonlinear relationship of its I-V characteristic. The data sheets of overall PV cells do not supply complete information of its parameters. This leads to a nonlinear mathematical model of PV with numerous unknown parameters. Consequently, in this paper, a new application of an appropriate optimization algorithm called Chaos Game Optimization algorithm (CGO) is proposed for estimating the unknown parameters of the three-diode (TD) PV model. The simulation results are carried out for PV real cells and PV module which with varying the temperature and irradiation. The proposed model of the PV module is evaluated by matching its results with the actual PV modules experimental results. To confirm the performance of the CGO algorithm in extracting the parameters of the PV model, its results are compared with the most present and robust techniques results in the literature. The results show that the CGO algorithm attains the least Root Mean Square Error (RMSE), the mean and standard deviation as the best solution. In addition, CGO provides the smallest implementation time compared with the other investigated algorithms.",0,1,1
"Insider Action Design Research a multi-methodological Information Systems research approach
The use of methodologies, and in particular multi-methodological approaches, to conduct scientific research in Information Systems discipline has been discussed in countless articles. While initially rigorous applied methodologies similar to those used in mathematics and physics have been endorsed, a need for tailored methodologies that take the human factor in Information Systems into consideration has pushed for endorsement of qualitative methodologies such as Action Research.

"Full-Body Torque-Level Non-linear Model Predictive Control for Aerial Manipulation
Non-linear model predictive control (nMPC) is a powerful approach to control complex robots (such as humanoids, quadrupeds or unmanned aerial manipulators (UAMs)) as it brings important advantages over other existing techniques. The full-body dynamics, along with the prediction capability of the optimal control problem (OCP) solved at the core of the controller, allows to actuate the robot in line with its dynamics. This fact enhances the robot capabilities and allows, e.g., to perform intricate maneuvers at high dynamics while optimizing the amount of energy used. Despite the many similarities between humanoids or quadrupeds and UAMs, full-body torque-level nMPC has rarely been applied to UAMs. This paper provides a thorough description of how to use such techniques in the field of aerial manipulation. We give a detailed explanation of the different parts involved in the OCP, from the UAM dynamical model to the residuals in the cost function. We develop and compare three different nMPC controllers: Weighted MPC, Rail MPC and Carrot MPC, which differ on the structure of their OCPs and on how these are updated at every time step. To validate the proposed framework, we present a wide variety of simulated case studies. First, we evaluate the trajectory generation problem, i.e., optimal control problems solved offline, involving different kinds of motions (e.g., aggressive maneuvers or contact locomotion) for different types UAMs. Then, we assess the performance of the three nMPC controllers, i.e., closed-loop controllers solved online, through a variety of realistic simulations. For the benefit of the community, we have made available the source code related to this work.",0,1,1
"Braess’s paradox and programmable behaviour in microfluidic networks
Microfluidic systems are now being designed with precision as miniaturized fluid manipulation devices that can execute increasingly complex tasks. However, their operation often requires numerous external control devices owing to the typically linear nature of microscale flows, which has hampered the development of integrated control mechanisms. Here we address this difficulty by designing microfluidic networks that exhibit a nonlinear relation between the applied pressure and the flow rate, which can be harnessed to switch the direction of internal flows solely by manipulating the input and/or output pressures. We show that these networks— implemented using rigid polymer channels carrying water—exhibit an experimentally supported fluid analogue of Braess’s paradox, in which closing an intermediate channel results in a higher, rather than lower, total flow rate. The harnessed behaviour is scalable and can be used to implement flow routing with multiple switches. These findings have the potential to advance the development of built-in control mechanisms in microfluidic networks, thereby facilitating the creation of portable systems and enabling novel applications in areas ranging from wearable healthcare technologies to deployable space systems.Microfluidic systems controlled by a single driving pressure are programmed to exhibit complex flow-switching schemes and a fluid analogue of Braess’s paradox by exploiting fluid inertia and network design.",0,0,1
"Direction of arrival estimation using the MUSIC algorithm for a MIMO OFDM radar
In this paper, the OFDM Radar and Communication System, which is equipped with a range and Doppler estimation algorithm, is extended to a MIMO configuration for target localization in the azimuth. This is done by exploiting the phase difference between multiple transmit-receive antenna pairs, along with utilizing orthogonal transmit signals. This paper presents a simulation-based investigation of achievable performance in terms of angular resolution with MUSIC. The MIMO-OFDM Radar adopts an interleaving frame structure for transmitting orthogonal waveforms in order to null the signal-to-interference ratio in the respective subchannels used and to avoid directivity of the transmit radiation pattern. The accuracy increases as more transmit and receive antenna pairs are used, as demonstrated in the paper where the simulation results of the 4×4 MIMO system outperforms the 2×2 system tremendously in terms of object separability at the separation angle of 5°.",0,0,0
"Manufacturing Dispatching using Reinforcement and Transfer Learning
Efficient dispatching rule in manufacturing industry is key to ensure product on-time delivery and minimum past-due and inventory cost. Manufacturing, especially in the developed world, is moving towards on-demand manufacturing meaning a high mix, low volume product mix. This requires efficient dispatching that can work in dynamic and stochastic environments, meaning it allows for quick response to new orders received and can work over a disparate set of shop floor settings. In this paper we address this problem of dispatching in manufacturing. Using reinforcement learning (RL), we propose a new design to formulate the shop floor state as a 2-D matrix, incorporate job slack time into state representation, and design lateness and tardiness rewards function for dispatching purpose. However, maintaining a separate RL model for each production line on a manufacturing shop floor is costly and often infeasible. To address this, we enhance our deep RL model with an approach for dispatching policy transfer. This increases policy generalization and saves time and cost for model training and data collection. Experiments show that: (1) our approach performs the best in terms of total discounted reward and average lateness, tardiness, (2) the proposed policy transfer approach reduces training time and increases policy generalization.",0,1,0
"Information privacy concerns and demographic characteristics: Data from a Korean media panel survey
Abstract This study explores the relationship between individuals' demographic characteristics and information privacy concerns (IPC) using panel data from the Korea Information Society Development Institute (KISDI) that has collected a large sample from 7809 respondents. Its goal is to address the gaps in existing information privacy literature that focuses mainly on behavioral determinants of IPC and thus has not paid much attention to the direct examination of the relationship between demographic characteristics of individuals and IPC.

"Ranking of Inventory Policies Using Distance Based Approach Method
— Globalization is putting enormous pressure on the business organizations specially manufacturing one to rethink the supply chain in innovative manners. Inventory consumes major portion of total sale revenue. Effective and efficient inventory management plays a vital role for the successful functioning of any organization. Selection of inventory policy is one of the important purchasing activities. This paper focuses on selection and ranking of alternative inventory policies. A deterministic quantitative model based on Distance Based Approach (DBA) method has been developed for evaluation and ranking of inventory policies. We have employed this concept first time for this type of the selection problem. Four inventory policies economic order quantity (EOQ), just in time (JIT), vendor managed inventory (VMI) and monthly policy are considered. Improper selection could affect a company’s competitiveness in terms of the productivity of its facilities and quality of its products. The ranking of inventory policies is a multi-criteria problem. There is a need to first identify the selection criteria and then processes the information with reference to relative importance of attributes for comparison. Criteria values for each inventory policy can be obtained either analytically or by using a simulation technique or they are linguistic subjective judgments defined by fuzzy sets, like, for example, the values of criteria. A methodology is developed and applied to rank the inventory policies.",0,0,0
"The Influence of Human Aspects on Requirements Engineering-related Activities: Software Practitioners’ Perspective
Requirements Engineering (RE)-related activities require high collaboration between various roles in software engineering (SE), such as requirements engineers, stakeholders, developers, etc. Their demographics, views, understanding of technologies, working styles, communication and collaboration capabilities make RE highly human dependent. Identifying how ”human aspects”– such as motivation, domain knowledge, communication skills, personality, emotions, culture, etc.– might impact RE-related activities would help us improve RE and SE in general.

"A Fully Decentralized Tuning-free Inexact Projection Method for P2P Energy Trading
Agent-based solutions lend themselves well to address privacy concerns and the computational scalability needs of future distributed electric grids and end-use energy exchanges. Decentralized decision-making methods are the key to enabling peer-to-peer energy trading between electricity prosumers. However, the performance of existing decentralized decision-making algorithms highly depends on the algorithmic design and hyperparameter tunings, limiting applicability. This paper aims to address this gap by proposing a decentralized inexact projection method that does not rely on parameter tuning or central coordination to achieve the optimal solution for Peer-to-Peer (P2P) energy trading problems. The proposed algorithm does not require parameter readjustments, and once tuned, it converges for a wide range of P2P setups. Moreover, each prosumer only needs to share limited information (i.e., updated coupled variable) with neighboring prosumers. The IEEE 13 bus test system is used to showcase our proposed method’s robustness and privacy advantages.

"The 'IKEA Effect': When Labor Leads to Love
In a series of studies in which consumers assembled IKEA boxes, folded origami, and built sets of Legos, we demonstrate and investigate the boundary conditions for what we term the “IKEA effect” – the increase in valuation of self-made products. Participants saw their amateurish creations – of both utilitarian and hedonic products – as similar in value to the creations of experts, and expected others to share their opinions. Our account suggests that labor leads to increased valuation only when labor results in successful completion of tasks; thus when participants built and then destroyed their creations, or failed to complete them, the IKEA effect dissipated. Finally, we show that labor increases valuation of completed products not just for consumers who profess an interest in “do-it-yourself” projects, but even for those who are relatively uninterested. We discuss the implications of the IKEA effect for marketing managers and organizations more generally.",0,1,0
"The Longer the Better? The Interplay Between Review Length and Line of Argumentation in Online Consumer Reviews
Review helpfulness serves as focal point in understanding customers' purchase decision-making process on online retailer platforms. An overwhelming majority of previous works find longer reviews to be more helpful than short reviews. In this paper, we propose that longer reviews should not be assumed to be uniformly more helpful; instead, we argue that the effect depends on the line of argumentation in the review text. To test this idea, we use a large dataset of customer reviews from Amazon in combination with a state-of-the-art approach from natural language processing that allows us to study argumentation lines at sentence level. Our empirical analysis suggests that the frequency of argumentation changes moderates the effect of review length on helpfulness. Altogether, we disprove the prevailing narrative that longer reviews are uniformly perceived as more helpful. Our findings allow retailer platforms to improve their customer feedback systems and to feature more useful product reviews.",0,0,0

"On-line power systems voltage stability monitoring using artificial neural networks
A method for on-line voltage stability monitoring of a power system based on Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) neural network is proposed in this paper. Considering that the power system is operating under quasistatic conditions, by using power flow model and singular value decomposition of the reduced Jacobian matrix, a suitable index to quantify the proximity of power system voltage instability is defined. Then, a neuronal network is trained to learn the correlation between the key factors of the voltage stability phenomena and this index. Once trained, the neural network provides the above mentioned voltage stability index as output for a predefined set of input variables that are known as directly influencing the stability conditions of the power system. Since the input variables for the neural network may be obtained from the steady state estimator, the proposed method can be implemented as a function of the Energy Management System (EMS) for on-line voltage stability monitoring. Tests are carried out using the IEEE 30-bus system, where different operating scenarios are considered.",0,1,1
"Design of Open-Closed-Loop Iterative Learning Control With Variable Stiffness for Multiple Flexible Manipulator Robot Systems
An open-closed-loop iterative learning method for multiple flexible manipulator systems with repeatable motion tasks was proposed to achieve the consensus tracking of a specified desired reference trajectory. The open-closed-loop iterative learning control scheme was used to reduce the effects of model error and disturbances, as the boundedness of both the tracking error and the control input can be simultaneously guaranteed. In addition, when combined with a novel rotational joint with a continuously adjustable stiffness, the open-closed-loop iterative learning method enhances the adaptability to meet the strict requirements of the next generation of robots with the physical human–robot interaction and highly dynamic motion. The convergence conditions of the approach were obtained by the theoretical analysis.

"Numerical simulation of a solar cooling system with and without phase change materials in radiant walls of a building
Abstract This work investigates energetically and financially a building solar cooling system with radiant walls which includes phase change materials (PCMs). The examined building has a floor area of 100 m2 and it is located in Athens (Greece). The solar cooling system includes evacuated tube collectors coupled to a single-effect absorption chiller for producing cold water for the building radiant walls. The use of PCM is examined in all the building’s outer walls and different scenarios with PCM in only some walls are also investigated in details. Different combinations of collecting areas and storage tank volumes are examined in order to determine the optimum design for every scenario. The study is performed with the commercial software TRNSYS which uses an active layer to simulate the radiant wall.

"Acoustic actuation of bioinspired microswimmers.
Acoustic actuation of bioinspired microswimmers is experimentally demonstrated. Microswimmers are fabricated in situ in a microchannel. Upon acoustic excitation, the flagellum of the microswimmer oscillates, which in turn generates linear or rotary movement depending on the swimmer design. The speed of these bioinspired microswimmers is tuned by adjusting the voltage amplitude applied to the acoustic transducer. Simple microfabrication and remote actuation are promising for biomedical applications.",0,0,1
"Automotive Radar Multipath Propagation in Uncertain Environments
Future use of high-resolution near range radar sensors for vehicle environment perception is facing challenges in terms of detection and correct assignment of multipath reflections (false-positives) from surfaces and obstacles. This paper presents a novel geometric model to determine the relative positions from surrounding targets and reflection surfaces assuming that every object moves on a circular path to a mutual center. Principles of electromagnetic wave propagation under consideration of incident wave angles at potential reflection surfaces are described. Radar measurements illuminating an experimental target and a highway barrier as reflection surface, which reproducibly generates several multipath reflections, were carried out in a deterministic test environment and validate our presented methods. The installation of absorption material at intense reflection areas was conducted as countermeasure to reduce the intensity of false-positive detections. Furthermore, a realistic urban driving scenario using a real vehicle as target object and a building wall was reconstructed to proof field relevance.",0,1,0

"Eco-Cooperative Adaptive Cruise Control at Signalized Intersections Considering Queue Effects
Traffic signals typically introduce vehicle stops along a trip and thus increase vehicle fuel consumption levels. In attempt to enhance vehicle fuel efficiency, eco-cooperative adaptive cruise control (Eco-CACC) systems are being developed that receive signal phasing and timing data from downstream signalized intersections via vehicle-to-infrastructure communication. In this paper, an Eco-CACC algorithm is developed that computes the fuel-optimum vehicle trajectory through a signalized intersection by ensuring that the vehicle arrives at the intersection stop bar just as the last queued vehicle is discharged. A simulation analysis demonstrates that the proposed Eco-CACC system produces vehicle fuel savings up to 40%, when the market penetration rate (MPR) is 100%. The results also demonstrate that for single-lane approaches, the algorithm reduces the overall fuel consumption levels for all vehicles, and that higher MPRs result in larger savings. Alternatively, on multi-lane approaches, lower MPRs produce negative impacts on the overall intersection fuel efficiency, and only when MPRs are greater than 30% does the algorithm produce overall intersection fuel consumption savings.",0,1,1
"Passive Flow Control for Series Inflatable Actuators: Application on a Wearable Soft-Robot for Posture Assistance
This letter presents a passive control method for multiple degrees of freedom in a soft pneumatic robot through the combination of flow resistor tubes with series inflatable actuators. We designed and developed these 3D printed resistors based on the pressure drop principle of multiple capillary orifices, which allows a passive control of its sequential activation from a single source of pressure. Our design fits in standard tube connectors, making it easy to adopt it on any other type of actuator with pneumatic inlets. We present its characterization of pressure drop and evaluation of the activation sequence for series and parallel circuits of actuators. Moreover, we present an application for the assistance of postural transition from lying to sitting. We embedded it in a wearable garment robot-suit designed for infants with cerebral palsy. Then, we performed the test with a dummy baby for emulating the upper-body motion control. The results show a sequential motion control of the sitting and lying transitions validating the proposed system for flow control and its application on the robot-suit.",1,1,1
"Investors Embrace Gender Diversity, Not Female CEOs: The Role of Gender in Startup Fundraising
The allocation of venture capital is one of the primary factors determining who takes products to market, which startups succeed or fail, and as such who gets to participate in the shaping of our collective economy. While gender diversity contributes to startup success, most funding is allocated to male-only entrepreneurial teams. In the wake of COVID-19, 2020 is seeing a notable decline in funding to female and mixed-gender teams, giving raise to an urgent need to study and correct the longstanding gender bias in startup funding allocation. We conduct an in-depth data analysis of over 48,000 companies on Crunchbase, comparing funding allocation based on the gender composition of founding teams. Detailed findings across diverse industries and geographies are presented. Further, we construct machine learning models to predict whether startups will reach an equity round, revealing the surprising finding that the CEO’s gender is the primary determining factor for attaining funding. Policy implications for this pressing issue are discussed. © 2021, ICST Institute for Computer Sciences, Social Informatics and Telecommunications Engineering.",0,1,0
"Dynamic Metasurface Antennas for 6G Extreme Massive MIMO Communications
Next generation wireless base stations and access points will transmit and receive using an extremely massive numbers of antennas. A promising technology for realizing such massive arrays in a dynamically controllable and scalable manner with reduced cost and power consumption utilizes surfaces of radiating metamaterial elements, known as metasurfaces. To date, metasurfaces are mainly considered in the context of wireless communications as passive reflecting devices, aiding conventional transceivers in shaping the propagation environment. This article presents an alternative application of metasurfaces for wireless communications as active reconfigurable antennas with advanced analog signal processing capabilities for next generation transceivers. We review the main characteristics of metasurfaces used for radiation and reception, and analyze their main advantages as well as their capability to reliably communicate in wireless networks.

"A Smart Environment-Adapting Timed-Up-and-Go System Powered by Sensor-Embedded Insoles
With the growth of the elder population, fall risk evaluation is crucial to prevent elders from serious injuries, as well as reduce related financial burdens. A balance assessment, timed up and go (TUG), has been widely used to estimate fall risk. The standardized TUG focuses on flat ground walking with no environmental variance. Therefore, it falls short of assessing an individual’s gait adaptability. Being able to adjust steps in response to environmental changes, for example, needing to navigate around or over a child’s toy left on the sidewalk, is essential to avoid fall risk and fundamental to community ambulation. To this end, we propose four environment-adapting TUGs designed to assess one’s ability to adapt gait in complex environments and a compatible system named Smart Insole TUG (SITUG), which provides real-time, feature-rich, and ease-of-operation TUG analysis. Based on experimental results, SITUG is capable of extracting gait related spatial–temporal features with all mean accuracies over 92%. Besides, the system achieves a mean accuracy of 92.23% in segmenting five TUG phases.",0,0,1
"Weak ties strengthen anger contagion in social media
Increasing evidence suggests that, similar to face-to-face communications, human emotions also spread in online social media. However, the mechanisms underlying this emotion contagion, for example, whether different feelings spread in unlikely ways or how the spread of emotions relates to the social network, is rarely investigated. Indeed, because of high costs and spatio-temporal limitations, explorations of this topic are challenging using conventional questionnaires or controlled experiments. Because they are collection points for natural affective responses of massive individuals, online social media sites offer an ideal proxy for tackling this issue from the perspective of computational social science. In this paper, based on the analysis of millions of tweets in Weibo, surprisingly, we find that anger travels easily along weaker ties than joy, meaning that it can infiltrate different communities and break free of local traps because strangers share such content more often. Through a simple diffusion model, we reveal that weaker ties speed up anger by applying both propagation velocity and coverage metrics. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time that quantitative long-term evidence has been presented that reveals a difference in the mechanism by which joy and anger are disseminated. With the extensive proliferation of weak ties in booming social media, our results imply that the contagion of anger could be profoundly strengthened to globalize its negative impact.",0,0,0
"Fault Diagnosis for Nonlinear Uncertain Systems Using Robust/Sliding Mode Observers
The authors investigate the fault diagnosis problem for a class of nonlinear multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems with uncertainty. Under some geometric conditions, the system is transformed into two different subsystems with uncertainty. The first one is in the generalized observer canonical form, which is not affected by actuator/sensor faults. Nonlinear robust observer or sliding mode observer can be constructed for this subsystem depending on different assumptions on the uncertainties. The second subsystem, whose states can be measured, is affected by the faults. The observation scheme is then used for actuator/sensor fault estimation with good accuracy. Finally, a flexible joint robotics example is given to illustrate the efficiency of the proposed methods.",0,1,1
"A Multi-dimensional Study of Requirements Changes in Agile Software Development Projects
Agile processes are now widely practiced by software engineering (SE) teams, and the agile manifesto claims that agile methods support responding to changes well. However, no study appears to have researched whether this is accurate in reality. Requirements changes (RCs) are inevitable in any software development environment, and we wanted to acquire a holistic picture of how RCs occur and are handled in agile SE teams in practice. We also wanted to know whether responding to changes is the only or a main reason for software teams to use agile in their projects. To do this we conducted a mixed-methods research study which comprised of interviews of 10 agile practitioners from New Zealand and Australia, a literature review, and an in-depth survey with the participation of 40 agile practitioners world-wide. Through this study we identified different types of RCs, their origination including reasons for origination, forms, sources, carriers, and events at which they originate, challenging nature, and finally whether agile helps to respond to changes or not. We also found that agile teams seem to be reluctant to accept RCs, and therefore, they use several mitigation strategies. Additionally, as they accept the RCs, they use a variety of techniques to handle them. Furthermore, we found that agile allowing better response to RCs is only a minor reason for practicing agile. Several more important reasons included being able to deliver the product in a shorter period and increasing team productivity. Practitioners stated this improves the agile team environment and thus are the real motivators for teams to practice agile. Finally, we provide a set of practical recommendations that can be used to better handle RCs effectively in agile software development environments.",1,1,0

"Anammox and beyond.
When looking back and wonder how we did it, I became even more aware of how my wanderings in microbiology are all linked, from the start of my PhD with Hans Veldkamp on sulfur oxidizing bacteria in chemostats. My interests broadened from obligate chemolithoautotrophic bacteria to facultative organisms and the question about the ecological niches of these different metabolic types. The sulfide oxidizing bacteria also may be used to produce elemental sulfur which can easily be removed from wastewater. This fitted in a long standing collaboration with Dimitry Sorokin on the ecophysiology and application of alkaliphilic sulfur bacteria. Then came the denitrifying sulfur oxidizing bacteria and their application to remove sulfide from wastewater, which lead to our interest in nitrate, nitrite and ammonium removal in general. The big surprise was the serendipitous discovery of the 'anammox'-process, whereby ammonium is anaerobically oxidized to dinitrogen gas with nitrite as electron acceptor. The early days of our anammox research are the main focus of this paper which describes the struggle of growing and identifying the most peculiar bacteria we ever came across. A specialized organelle, the anammoxosome was shown to be responsible for the key ammonium oxidation, whereby a rocket fuel, hydrazine, turned out to be an intermediate. Soon after we became aware that anammox is everywhere and in the marine environment makes up a major portion of the nitrogen cycle. The intense scientific collaboration with Mike Jetten and Mark van Loosdrecht and colleagues led to our further understanding and application of this fascinating process which is briefly summarized in this paper. My broader interest in environmental microbiology and microbial ecology has been a regularly returning theme, taking me all over the world to great collaborations lasting to this very day.

Models for wind disturbances, quadrotor dynamics in wind and onboard measurements are presented and an estimation algorithm is developed for the current wind velocity experienced by the vehicle.

"An Adaptive Energy Management Strategy to Extend Battery Lifetime of Solar Powered Wireless Sensor Nodes
Traditional energy management strategies of wireless sensor network (WSN) nodes with hybrid energy storage do not adequately combine the merits of supercapacitors (SCs) and batteries, and thus, battery degradation remains a problem that restricts the lifetime of the WSN nodes. In this paper, an adaptive rule-based energy management strategy is proposed to extend the battery lifetime of a solar-powered wireless sensor node. The energy models are constructed with the consideration of the battery degradation, and Poisson distribution is utilized to simulate the power consumption variation of the node. A rule-based energy management strategy that is adaptive with the SC capacity and load conditions is designed. Traditional energy management strategies of the WSN nodes are compared with the proposed one. The simulation results indicate that the proposed strategy can improve the node lifetime from several tens of days to more than ten years. Meanwhile, the strategy ensures the continuous availability of the solar-powered WSN nodes even at night throughout the long lifetime. The robustness of the strategy is also tested. It is revealed that the strategy is adaptive with the SC capacity and workload conditions. The proposed strategy is broadly applicable and promising to resolve the problem of limited battery lifetime for the solar-powered WSN nodes.",0,1,1

"One-step rendezvous guidance for improving observability in bearings-only navigation
Abstract In spacecraft rendezvous, bearings-only navigation generally suffers from a lack of observability in range direction. Therefore, dedicated orbital maneuvers are essential to improve the observability and meet the navigation requirement. This paper proposes a simple one-step guidance method for improving observability. A new cost that quantifies the observability is defined by exploiting a Fisher information matrix (FIM). The resulting delta-v solution, recursively obtained at every maneuvering instant, enables the mission to fulfill the navigation requirement as well as the safety requirement and the final boundary condition. Thanks to its low computational burden, the proposed guidance method can be easily extended to the closed-loop guidance/navigation system. The closed-loop formulation makes the tracking performance robust against the disturbances and the thruster model errors. Numerical simulations demonstrate the effectiveness of the one-step guidance and the extended closed-loop guidance in a v-bar rendezvous scenario.",0,0,1
"The antecedents of SME innovativeness in an emerging transition economy
Abstract Understanding forces that contribute to the success of small and medium enterprises (SMEs) is very important, as these enterprises are vital for both developed and developing economies. Since innovativeness is among the most important means through which such businesses contribute to economic growth, numerous research studies were conducted to determine which factors positively impact SME's innovative efforts. This is an even more important issue for developing economies, where SMEs are often faced with inadequate infrastructure. Since there is a lack of studies on SME innovation in developing economies, often policy in such countries is based on findings from developed countries. In this paper, we explore factors that drive innovation activities in SMEs in a small emerging transition economy (Croatia), and compare it with findings from developed economies. In addition to factors used in most previous studies, we consider market scope, firm's market orientation and presence of strategic, managerial and marketing changes. We find that most factors that were found to be important in developed economies are important in developing economies as well. In addition to that, market scope was discovered to be a very important factor in both product and process innovation. Implementing corporate changes has positive impact on radical product innovation while implementing new organizational structures has positive effect on incremental innovation. When investigating determinants of product innovation, we distinguish new products of low novelty from new products of high novelty, and show that they need to be supported by different policies. To gain additional insight in innovation efforts, we examine obstacles to innovation. We find that firms that report facing obstacles are not less likely to innovate less, which suggests that innovators are able to work around obstacles without damaging effects to innovation. This study is based on a postal survey of 448 SMEs in Croatia, which was performed in 2004.",0,1,0
"Estimation of collective maneuvers through cooperative multi-agent planning
In order to determine a cooperative driving strategy, it is beneficial for an autonomous vehicle to incorporate the intended motion of surrounding vehicles within its own motion planning. However, as intentions cannot be measured directly and the motion of multiple vehicles often are highly interdependent, this incorporation has proven challenging. In this paper, the problem of maneuver estimation is addressed, focusing on situations with close interaction between traffic participants. Therefore, we define collective maneuvers based on trajectory homotopy, describing the relative motion of multiple vehicles in a scene. Representing maneuvers by sample trajectories, maneuver-dependent prediction models of the vehicle states can be defined. This allows for a Bayesian estimation of maneuver probabilities given observations of the real motion. The approach is evaluated by simulation in overtaking scenarios with oncoming traffic and merging scenarios at an intersection.",0,1,1
"How does working from home affect developer productivity? — A case study of Baidu during the COVID-19 pandemic
Nowadays, working from home (WFH) has become a popular work arrangement due to its many potential benefits for both companies and employees (e.g., increasing job satisfaction and retention of employees). Many previous studies have investigated the impact of WFH on the productivity of employees. However, most of these studies usually use a qualitative analysis method such as surveys and interviews, and the studied participants do not work from home for a long continuing time. Due to the outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), a large number of companies asked their employees to work from home, which provides us an opportunity to investigate whether WFH affects their productivity. In this study, to investigate the difference in developer productivity between WFH and working onsite, we conduct a quantitative analysis based on a dataset of developers’ daily activities from Baidu Inc., one of the largest IT companies in China. In total, we collected approximately four thousand records of 139 developers’ activities of 138 working days. Out of these records, 1103 records are submitted when developers work from home due to the COVID-19 pandemic. We find that WFH has both positive and negative impacts on developer productivity in terms of different metrics, e.g., the number of builds/commits/code reviews. We also notice that WFH has different impacts on projects with different characteristics including programming language, project type/age/size. For example, WFH has a negative impact on developer productivity for large projects. Additionally, we find that productivity varies for different developers. Based on these findings, we get some feedback from developers of Baidu and understand some reasons why WFH has different impacts on developer productivity. We also conclude several implications for both companies and developers.",0,1,0
"A compact two-phase twisted string actuation system: Modeling and validation
Abstract In this paper, we propose a compact twisted string actuation system that achieves a high contraction percentage (81%) on two phases: multi string twist and overtwist. This type of system can be used in many robotic applications, such as robotic hands and exoskeletons. The overtwist phase enables the development of more compact actuators based on the twisted string systems. Furthermore, by analyzing the previously developed mathematical models, we found out that a constant radius model should be applied for the overtwisting phase. Moreover, we propose an improvement of an existing model for prediction of the radius of the multi string system after they twist around each other. This model helps to better estimate the bundle diameter which results in a more precise mathematical model for multi string systems. The model was validated by performing experiments with 2, 4, 6 and 8 string systems. Finally, we performed extensive life cycle tests with different loads and contractions to find out the expected life of the system.",0,0,1
"Optimal Robustness in Power Grids From a Network Science Perspective
In recent years, the frequent occurrences of large-scale blackouts highlight the necessity of enhancing the robustness of power grids. In this brief, based on the cascading failure model which considers both the network topology and electrical characteristics running in power grids, we study how the topological metrics affect the robustness of power grids. The topological metrics considered include both the connectivity of the network and the distribution of generators. We compare the results in typical complex network models and an IEEE 118-bus network. Moreover, by using the simulated annealing method, we find the optimal network topology to achieve the best network robustness, and compare the topological metrics before and after the optimization to verify our findings. The results show that, in order to enhance the robustness of power grids, it is better to make the network sparsely connected, and place the generators as hubs and decentralize these generators.",0,0,1

"Minimizing Energy Consumption and Peak Power of Series Elastic Actuators: A Convex Optimization Framework for Elastic Element Design
Compared to rigid actuators, series elastic actuators (SEAs) offer a potential reduction of motor energy consumption and peak power, though these benefits are highly dependent on the design of the torque-elongation profile of the elastic element. In the case of linear springs, natural dynamics is a traditional method for this design, but it has two major limitations—arbitrary load trajectories are difficult or impossible to analyze and it does not consider actuator constraints. Parametric optimization is also a popular design method that addresses these limitations, but solutions are only optimal within the space of the parameters. To overcome these limitations, we propose a nonparametric convex optimization program for the design of the nonlinear elastic element that minimizes energy consumption and peak power for an arbitrary periodic reference trajectory. To obtain convexity, we introduce a convex approximation to the expression of peak power; energy consumption is shown to be convex without approximation. The combination of peak power and energy consumption in the cost function leads to a multiobjective convex optimization framework that comprises the main contribution of this paper. As a case study, we recover the elongation-torque profile of a cubic spring, given its natural oscillation as the reference load. We then design nonlinear SEAs for an ankle prosthesis that minimize energy consumption and peak power for different trajectories and extend the range of achievable tasks when subject to actuator constraints.",0,1,1
"Forward Kinematics for Suspended Under-Actuated Cable-Driven Parallel Robots: A Neural Network Approach

"Addressing Marketing Bias in Product Recommendations
Modern collaborative filtering algorithms seek to provide personalized product recommendations by uncovering patterns in consumer-product interactions. However, these interactions can be biased by how the product is marketed, for example due to the selection of a particular human model in a product image. These correlations may result in the underrepresentation of particular niche markets in the interaction data; for example, a female user who would potentially like motorcycle products may be less likely to interact with them if they are promoted using stereotypically 'male' images. In this paper, we first investigate this correlation between users' interaction feedback and products' marketing images on two real-world e-commerce datasets. We further examine the response of several standard collaborative filtering algorithms to the distribution of consumer-product market segments in the input interaction data, revealing that marketing strategy can be a source of bias for modern recommender systems. In order to protect recommendation performance on underrepresented market segments, we develop a framework to address this potential marketing bias. Quantitative results demonstrate that the proposed approach significantly improves the recommendation fairness across different market segments, with a negligible loss (or better) recommendation accuracy.",0,1,0

"Forecasting confirmed cases of the COVID-19 pandemic with a migration-based epidemiological model
The unprecedented coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic is still a worldwide threat to human life since its invasion into the daily lives of the public in the first several months of 2020. Predicting the size of confirmed cases is important for countries and communities to make proper prevention and control policies so as to effectively curb the spread of COVID-19. Different from the 2003 SARS epidemic and the worldwide 2009 H1N1 influenza pandemic, COVID-19 has unique epidemiological characteristics in its infectious and recovered compartments. This drives us to formulate a new infectious dynamic model for forecasting the COVID-19 pandemic within the human mobility network, named the SaucIR-model in the sense that the new compartmental model extends the benchmark SIR model by dividing the flow of people in the infected state into asymptomatic, pathologically infected but unconfirmed, and confirmed. Furthermore, we employ dynamic modeling of population flow in the model in order that spatial effects can be incorporated effectively. We forecast the spread of accumulated confirmed cases in some provinces of mainland China and other countries that experienced severe infection during the time period from late February to early May 2020. The novelty of incorporating the geographic spread of the pandemic leads to a surprisingly good agreement with published confirmed case reports. The numerical analysis validates the high degree of predictability of our proposed SaucIR model compared to existing resemblance. The proposed forecasting SaucIR model is implemented in Python. A web-based application is also developed by Dash (under construction).",0,0,0

The radar transceivers are used to perform fast and accurate measurements from 200 GHz to 250 GHz within milliseconds. The dielectric constant and losses are determined using a free-space reflection measurement at normal incident on a given material sample. The FMCW transceiver is calibrated using adopted methods from vector network analysis.",0,1,0
"A retaliatory role for algal projectiles, with implications for the mechanochemistry of diatom gliding motility*
It is shown that the projectiles ejected by discobolocysts in the single-celled Chrysophyceaen alga Ochromonas tuberculatus travel at speeds of up to 0·26 km/s, as fast as a bullet from a low power rifle. They may thus inflict damage to a would-be predator. Their Reynolds number is high, around 100, far from the low Reynolds numbers presumed typical of cellular events. Hydration of the mucopolysaccharide in discobolocysts, by one to three hydrogen bonds per monomer, is shown to be a sufficient source of energy for this mechanochemical reaction. The hydrogen bonding appears to induce a conformational change, rather than swelling of the mucopolysaccharide. It is also shown that the same degree of hydration of mucopolysaccharides would provide sufficient motive force to explain the gliding motility of raphid diatoms, when incorporated into the capillarity model for diatom locomotion. The efficiency of the diatom's mechanochemical raphe system may be as high as 99%. The microfilament bundles adjacent to the raphe inside the cell may control forward, stop and reverse functions by a sliding mechanism.",0,1,1
"Blockchain as a disruptive technology for business: A systematic review
Abstract Blockchain is the latest ‘disruptive innovation’ that has caught scholars’ attention. It is the underlying technology for Bitcoin and other digital currencies. Stakeholders like developers, entrepreneurs, and technology enthusiasts claim blockchain has the potential to reconfigure the contemporary economic, legal, political and cultural landscape. Skeptics claim the concept and its applications remain ambiguous and uncertain. Business scholars began publishing studies on the emergence and impact of blockchain, bitcoin, and related projects in 2014. In this study, we conduct a PRISMA guided systematic review of blockchain research in the business literature from 2014 to 2018. Our results show a rapid increase of studies over the five year period. The findings also convey key insights about the current state of scholarly investigation on blockchain, including its top benefits and challenges for business and society. We found that blockchain remains an early-stage domain of research in terms of theoretical grounding, methodological diversity, and empirically grounded work. We suggest research directions to improve our understanding of the state of blockchain and advance future research of this increasingly important and expansive area.",0,1,0
"A network typology: From theory to practice
Abstract Based on a longitudinal study of aging in rural communities in North Wales, the article describes the development of a typology of the informal support networks of elderly people based on qualitative data from an intensive study and subsequent operationalization for use in a large sample longitudinal survey (N = 534 at 77). Relationships with demographic variables and service use are described and policy implications identified. Network type was found to be highly predictive of service use and availability of informal support. The development of the typology as a practice tool for workers in community care is discussed.",0,1,0
"Institutional Horizontal Shareholdings and Generic Entry in the Pharmaceutical Industry
Brand-name pharmaceutical companies often file lawsuits against generic drug manufacturers that challenge the monopoly status of patent-protected drugs. Institutional horizontal shareholdings, measured by the generic shareholders' ownership in the brand-name company relative to their ownership in the generic manufacturer, are significantly positively associated with the likelihood that the two parties enter into a settlement agreement in which the brand pays the generic manufacturer to stay out of the market. Horizontal shareholdings are also positively associated with the brand's daily abnormal stock returns around the settlement agreement. Generic manufacturers who settle with the brand-name company are more likely to delay the sale of generic substitutes if they have higher horizontal shareholdings with the brand-name firm. These delays preclude other generic firms from entering the market.",0,0,0
"Large teams develop and small teams disrupt science and technology
One of the most universal trends in science and technology today is the growth of large teams in all areas, as solitary researchers and small teams diminish in prevalence1–3. Increases in team size have been attributed to the specialization of scientific activities3, improvements in communication technology4,5, or the complexity of modern problems that require interdisciplinary solutions6–8. This shift in team size raises the question of whether and how the character of the science and technology produced by large teams differs from that of small teams. Here we analyse more than 65 million papers, patents and software products that span the period 1954–2014, and demonstrate that across this period smaller teams have tended to disrupt science and technology with new ideas and opportunities, whereas larger teams have tended to develop existing ones. Work from larger teams builds on more-recent and popular developments, and attention to their work comes immediately. By contrast, contributions by smaller teams search more deeply into the past, are viewed as disruptive to science and technology and succeed further into the future—if at all. Observed differences between small and large teams are magnified for higher-impact work, with small teams known for disruptive work and large teams for developing work. Differences in topic and research design account for a small part of the relationship between team size and disruption; most of the effect occurs at the level of the individual, as people move between smaller and larger teams. These results demonstrate that both small and large teams are essential to a flourishing ecology of science and technology, and suggest that, to achieve this, science policies should aim to support a diversity of team sizes.Analyses of the output produced by large versus small teams of researchers and innovators demonstrate that their work differs systematically in the extent to which it disrupts or develops existing science and technology.",0,1,0

This paper will then present a description of the 342-Node IEEE Low Voltage Network Test System and power flow results.",0,0,1
"Customer purchase prediction through machine learning
Due to today’s transition from visiting physical stores to online shopping, predicting customer behavior in the context of e-commerce is gaining importance. It can in- crease customer satisfaction and sales, resulting in higher conversion rates and a competitive advantage, by facilitating a more personalized shopping process. By uti- lizing clickstream and supplementary customer data, models for predicting customer behavior can be built. This study analyzes machine learning models to predict a pur- chase, which is a relevant use case as applied by a large German clothing retailer. Next, to comparing models this study further gives insight into the performance dif- ferences of the models on sequential clickstream and the static customer data, by conducting a descriptive data analysis and separately training the models on the dif- ferent datasets. The results indicate that a Random Forest algorithm is best suited for the prediction task, showing the best performance results, reasonable latency, of- fering comprehensibility and a high robustness. Regarding the different data types, models trained on sequential session data outperformed models trained on the static customer data by far. The best results were obtained when combining both datasets.",0,0,0
"Secure robust relay beamforming: a convex conic approximation approach
In this study, the problem of secure robust relay beamforming for peer-to-peer networks in the presence of eavesdroppers has been optimised and relaxed by assuming the imperfect knowledge of eavesdroppers’ channel state information (CSI). Since the wiretap CSI is imperfect at its legitimate transmitter and receiver, it is a critical issue to make the optimisation problem robust against the channel uncertainty. The authors’ optimisation problem aims to maximise the probabilistic secrecy rate that is subject to keeping the probability of the transmission power of the relays below a specific threshold. The problem is shown to be non-convex in its original form since the outage probability constraint does not admit a closed-form expression and it is a non-deterministic polynomial complete problem. They have presented three novel stochastic methods to handle the outage probability constraint. It has been shown that after some relaxation and randomisation, the problem can be represented as a convex optimisation problem which can be efficiently solved using interior point methods. Simulation results have been presented to verify the advantages of their methods.",0,0,0
"A Causal Mediation Model for Longitudinal Mediators and Survival Outcomes with an Application to Animal Behavior
In animal behavior studies, a common goal is to investigate the causal pathways between an exposure and outcome, and a mediator that lies in between. Causal mediation analysis provides a principled approach for such studies. Although many applications involve longitudinal data, the existing causal mediation models are not directly applicable to settings where the mediators are measured on irregular time grids. In this paper, we propose a causal mediation model that accommodates longitudinal mediators on arbitrary time grids and survival outcomes simultaneously. We take a functional data analysis perspective and view longitudinal mediators as realizations of underlying smooth stochastic processes. We deﬁne causal estimands of direct and indirect effects accordingly and provide corresponding identiﬁcation assumptions. We employ a functional principal component analysis approach to estimate the mediator process and propose a Cox hazard model for the survival outcome that ﬂexibly adjusts the mediator process. We then derive a g-computation formula to express the causal estimands using the model coefﬁcients. The proposed method is applied to a longitudinal data set from the Amboseli Baboon Research Project to investigate the causal relationships between early adversity, adult physiological stress responses, and survival among wild female baboons. We ﬁnd that adversity experienced in early life has a signiﬁcant direct effect on females’ life expectancy and survival probability, but ﬁnd little evidence that these effects were mediated by markers of the stress response in adulthood. We further developed a sensitivity analysis method to assess the impact of potential violation to the key assumption of sequential ignorability. Supplementary materials",0,0,0
"Nonsmooth Mechanics Based on Linear Projection Operator
This paper presents a unifying dynamics formulation for nonsmooth multibody systems (MBSs) subject to changing topology and multiple impacts based on linear projection operator. An oblique projection matrix ubiquitously derives all characteristic variables of such systems as follow: i) The constrained acceleration before jump discontinuity from projection of unconstrained acceleration, ii) post-impact velocity from projection of preimpact velocity, iii) impulse during impact from projection of pre-impact momentum, iv) generalized constraint force from projection of generalized input force, and v) post-impact kinetic energy from pre-impact kinetic energy based on projected inertia matrix. All solutions are presented in closed-form with elegant geometrical interpretations. The formulation is general enough to be applicable to MBSs subject to simultaneous multiple impacts with non-identical restitution coefficients, changing topology, i.e., unilateral constraints becomes inactive or vice versa, or even when the overall constraint Jacobian becomes singular. Not only do the solutions always exist regardless the constraint condition, but also the condition number for a generalized constraint inertia matrix is minimized in order to reduce numerical sensitivity in computation of the projection matrix to roundoff errors. The model is proven to be energetically consistent if a global restitution coefficient is assumed. In the case of non-identical restitution coefficients, the set of energetically consistent restitution matrices is characterized by using Linear Matrix Inequality (LMI).",0,1,1

"The Homophily Principle in Social Network Analysis
In recent years, social media has become a ubiquitous and integral part of social networking. One of the major attentions made by social researchers is the tendency of like-minded people to interact with one another in social groups, a concept which is known as Homophily. The study of homophily can provide eminent insights into the flow of information and behaviors within a society and this has been extremely useful in analyzing the formations of online communities. In this paper, we review and survey the effect of homophily in social networks and summarize the state of art methods that has been proposed in the past years to identify and measure the effect of homophily in multiple types of social networks and we conclude with a critical discussion of open challenges and directions for future research.",0,0,0
"Establishment of Work-Flow for Roof Damage Detection Utilizing Drones, Human and AI based on Human-in-the-Loop Framework
Once disaster occurs, we have to understand the whole picture of damage situation. However, there is not enough human resources and time to do it. In 2019, we were affected by Yamagata earthquake, and many buildings were damaged in Murakami city. Most of buildings damage were concentrated on their roofs. Local responders tried to inspect those roof damage, however they cannot do it from ground. Against this issue, we decided to take images of roof damage utilizing drones. We designed the flight plan covering over affected area, operated a drone, and got images. Aftermath, we created orthophoto mosaic from those images. We published it for local responders to inspect roof damage of each building in the web-based GIS platform. Furthermore, we detect roof damage by human and let AI learn the result of our detection of roof damage. This is followed the framework of Human-in-the-Loop. Just now, accuracy of the roof-damage detection by AI was not so high. In this paper, we introduce the work-flow of this challenge from designing flight plan for drone to roof-damage detection by AI which is educated with images of actual damage situation after disaster occurrence.",0,1,1
"Challenges of Scaled Agile for Safety-Critical Systems
Automotive companies increasingly adopt scaled agile methods to allow them to deal with their organisational and product complexity. Suitable methods are needed to ensure safety when developing automotive systems. On a small scale, R-Scrum and SafeScrum® are two concrete suggestions for how to develop safety-critical systems using agile methods. However, for large-scale environments, existing frameworks like SAFe or LeSS do not support the development of safety-critical systems out of the box. We, therefore, aim to understand which challenges exist when developing safety-critical systems within large-scale agile industrial settings, in particular in the automotive domain. Based on an analysis of R-Scrum and SafeScrum®, we conducted a focus group with three experts from industry to collect challenges in their daily work. We found challenges in the areas of living traceability, continuous compliance, and organisational flexibility. Among others, organisations struggle with defining a suitable traceability strategy, performing incremental safety analysis, and with integrating safety practices into their scaled way of working. Our results indicate a need to provide practical approaches to integrate safety work into large-scale agile development and point towards possible solutions, e.g., modular safety cases.",1,0,0
"Fresh teams are associated with original and multidisciplinary research.
Teamwork is one of the most prominent features in modern science. It is now well understood that team size is an important factor that affects the creativity of the team. However, the crucial question of how the character of research studies is related to the freshness of a team remains unclear. Here, we quantify the team freshness according to the absence of prior collaboration among team members. Our results suggest that papers produced by fresher teams are associated with greater originality and a greater multidisciplinary impact. These effects are even stronger in larger teams. Furthermore, we find that freshness defined by new team members in a paper is a more effective indicator of research originality and multidisciplinarity compared with freshness defined by new collaboration relationships among team members. Finally, we show that the career freshness of team members is also positively correlated with the originality and multidisciplinarity of produced papers.",0,0,0
"Non-Stationarities in Extra-Large-Scale Massive MIMO
Massive MIMO, a key technology for increasing area spectral efficiency in cellular systems, was developed assuming moderately sized apertures. In this article, we argue that massive MIMO systems behave differently in large-scale regimes due to spatial non-stationarity. In the large-scale regime, with arrays of around 50 wavelengths, the terminals see the whole array but non-stationarities occur because different regions of the array see different propagation paths. At even larger dimensions, which we call the extra-large scale regime, terminals see a portion of the array and inside the first type of non-stationarities might occur. We show that the non-stationarity properties of the massive MIMO channel change several important MIMO design aspects. In simulations, we demonstrate how non-stationarity is a curse when neglected but a blessing when embraced in terms of computational load and multi-user transceiver design.",0,1,0
"Online selling mode choice and pricing in an O2O tourism supply chain considering corporate social responsibility
This paper considers an online-to-offline (O2O) tourism supply 
chain (TSC) consisting of an offline tourism service provider (TSP) and an online travel agency (OTA) who has a corporate social responsibility (CSR). We investigate three possible online selling modes: (1) the OTA purchases products from the TSP and sells them to end tourists (Mode R); (2) the OTA charges the TSP a profit-sharing rate (Mode M); (3) the TSP sells products through both the reselling and marketplace channels (Mode D). Based on these three modes, we establish three game-theoretic models to explore the optimal online selling mode and pricing decisions for the 
TSC and its members. Our analyses and results show that when Mode D is unavailable: if OTA's cost advantage is relatively low, the TSC members should set a moderate profit-sharing rate and choose Mode M; Conversely, Mode R is better for them under a moderate or not too high profit-sharing rate. When Mode D is also available: Mode M is always worse than Mode D, while Mode R may be better than Mode D under some conditions. Furthermore, we conduct numerical studies and sensitivity analyses, which demonstrate that in Mode D, the TSC should pay more attention to CSR and improve consumers' channel acceptance for the reselling channel to create 
more total utility.",0,0,0
"The Shifting Sands of Motivation: Revisiting What Drives Contributors in Open Source
Open Source Software (OSS) has changed drastically over the last decade, with OSS projects now producing a large ecosystem of popular products, involving industry participation, and providing professional career opportunities. But our field's understanding of what motivates people to contribute to OSS is still fundamentally grounded in studies from the early 2000s. With the changed landscape of OSS, it is very likely that motivations to join OSS have also evolved. Through a survey of 242 OSS contributors, we investigate shifts in motivation from three perspectives: (1) the impact of the new OSS landscape, (2) the impact of individuals' personal growth as they become part of OSS communities, and (3) the impact of differences in individuals' demographics. Our results show that some motivations related to social aspects and reputation increased in frequency and that some intrinsic and internalized motivations, such as learning and intellectual stimulation, are still highly relevant. We also found that contributing to OSS often transforms extrinsic motivations to intrinsic, and that while experienced contributors often shift toward altruism, novices often shift toward career, fun, kinship, and learning. OSS projects can leverage our results to revisit current strategies to attract and retain contributors, and researchers and tool builders can better support the design of new studies and tools to engage and support OSS development.",1,0,0
"Strolling in Room-Scale VR: Hex-Core-MK1 Omnidirectional Treadmill
The natural locomotion interface is critical to the development of many VR applications. For household VR applications, there are two basic requirements: natural immersive experience and minimized space occupation. The existing locomotion strategies generally do not simultaneously satisfy these two requirements well. This paper presents a novel omnidirectional treadmill (ODT) system named Hex-Core-MK1 (HCMK1). By implementing two kinds of mirror-symmetrical spiral rollers to generate the omnidirectional velocity field, this proposed system is capable of providing real walking experiences with a full-degree of freedom in an area as small as 1.76 m2, while delivering great advantages over several existing ODT systems in terms of weight, volume, latency and dynamic performance. Compared with the sizes of Infinadeck and HCP, the two best motor-driven ODTs so far, the 8 cm height of HCMK1 is only 20% of Infinadeck and 50% of HCP. In addition, HCMK1 is a lightweight device weighing only 110 kg, which provides possibilities for further expanding VR scenarios, such as terrain simulation. The system latency of HCMK1 is only 9ms. The experiments show that HCMK1 can deliver a starting acceleration of 16.00 m/s2 and a braking acceleration of 30.00 m/s2.",0,1,1

"Design and Analysis of Modular Pipe Climber-III with a Multi-Output Differential Mechanism
This paper presents the design of an in-pipe climbing robot that operates using a novel ‘Three-output open differential’(3-OOD) mechanism to traverse complex networks of pipes. Conventional wheeled/tracked in-pipe climbing robots are prone to slip and drag while traversing in pipe bends. The 3-OOD mechanism helps in achieving the novel result of eliminating slip and drag in the robot tracks during motion. The proposed differential realizes the functional abilities of the traditional two-output differential, which is achieved the first time for a differential with three outputs. The 3-OOD mechanism mechanically modulates the track speeds of the robot based on the forces exerted on each track inside the pipe network, by eliminating the need for any active control. The simulation of the robot traversing in the pipe network in different orientations and in pipe-bends without slip shows the proposed design’s effectiveness.",1,1,1
"Game-Theoretic Electric Vehicle Charging Management Resilient to Non-Ideal User Behavior
In this paper, an electric vehicle (EV) charging competition, among EV aggregators that perform coordinated EV charging, is explored while taking into consideration potential non-ideal actions of the aggregators. In the coordinated EV charging strategy presented in this paper, each aggregator determines EV charging start time and charging energy profiles to minimize overall EV charging energy cost by including consideration of the actions of the neighboring aggregators. The competitive interactions of the aggregators are modeled by developing a two-stage non-cooperative game among the aggregators. The game is then studied under prospect theory to examine the impacts of non-ideal actions of the aggregators in selecting EV charging start times according to subjectively evaluating their opponents’ actions. It is shown that the non-cooperative interactions among the aggregators lead to a subgame perfect  $\epsilon $ -Nash equilibrium when the game is played with either ideal, or non-ideal, actions of the aggregators. A case study presented demonstrates that the benefits of the coordinated EV charging strategy, in terms of energy cost savings and peak-to-average ratio reductions, are significantly resilient to non-ideal actions of the aggregators.",0,0,1
"Expanding Explainability: Towards Social Transparency in AI systems
As AI-powered systems increasingly mediate consequential decision-making, their explainability is critical for end-users to take informed and accountable actions. Explanations in human-human interactions are socially-situated. AI systems are often socio-organizationally embedded. However, Explainable AI (XAI) approaches have been predominantly algorithm-centered. We take a developmental step towards socially-situated XAI by introducing and exploring Social Transparency (ST), a sociotechnically informed perspective that incorporates the socio-organizational context into explaining AI-mediated decision-making. To explore ST conceptually, we conducted interviews with 29 AI users and practitioners grounded in a speculative design scenario. We suggested constitutive design elements of ST and developed a conceptual framework to unpack ST’s effect and implications at the technical, decision-making, and organizational level. The framework showcases how ST can potentially calibrate trust in AI, improve decision-making, facilitate organizational collective actions, and cultivate holistic explainability. Our work contributes to the discourse of Human-Centered XAI by expanding the design space of XAI.",0,1,0
"Characteristics of the Hospitality, Omotenashi in the Traditional Japanese Inn : A Case Study of Kagaya (10周年記念号)
In this paper, the authors will clarify the characteristics of omotenasi, Japanese hospitality in the traditional Japanese inn. The authors especially analyze the case of Kagaya that is the most famous Japanese inn. The research question is concerned with the okami’s leadership style. They hypothesize okami’s leadership for omotenashi is based on the servant leadership and shered with top executives in the inn. They also hypothesize okami’s leadership for omotenashi infect the follower and explain the mechanism of the infection. Finally they consider the education system to make an effective okami. The authors discuss the limitation and future research direction. Abdulelah Al-alsheikh and Yoshinobu Sato Characteristics of the Hospitality, Omotenashi in the Traditional Japanese Inn : A Case Study of Kagaya the Kagaya as an object of case study research, the focus of the paper is on the third generation, president Yoshihiko and landlady, okami Mayumi Odas’ leadership behavior, which dramatically grown Kagaya. In Section 4, we theorize the characteristics of “the omotenashi” of the Japanese inn which became clear from a case of Kagaya. Finally we summarize characteristics of the omotenashi of the Japanese inn and breifly show the limit and future direction of this study in Section 5. II The Research Questions and Overview of the Previous Research The first question to be asked with research about omotenashi provided by the okami of the Japanese inn is “how the okami becomes the okami.” Kang (2013, p. 67) reported the result as follows from the survey of its 1990 (sample number of 111 cases) about the reason becoming okami. Kang reported that 55 percent became the okami from coming to the daughter-inlaw (wife okami) and 22.5% became okami of the reason of daughter (daughter okmi). In addition, Kang (2013, p. 67) quotes the survey by other researcher performed in 2010 (137 number of the samples). According to this research, daughter-in-law okami was 47.9%, daughter okami was 17.9%, 17.1% became okami because nobody would like to become okami other than her, and 16.2% was a founding okami. As for Kagaya, the second generation okami Taka and the third generation okami Mayumi were also the daughter-in-law okami. Then what kind of role does an okami play and what kind of ability is required to okami? About the role of okami, Kang (2013, p. 67) introduces a result of “the survey research about the role of the okami” that Japan Travel Bureau announced in 1999. The survey classified the role of the okami to 16 items and defined the degree of the okami’s role as 4 items, “okami decides”, “okami involves”, “okami as as adviser”, and “okami almost not involved.” When using the total percentage of the answer of the former two items, the items in descending order are as follows. Customer service (65.7%), equipment and consumables management (60.5%), management of service delivery employees (60.3%), office work charge employee management (57.5%), food menu (48.6%), sales promotion (40.9%), business performance numerical check (39.5 percent), managers management (38.6%), cooking department employee management (38.1%), stocking management of in-store kiosks (34.3%), procurement of food materials management (33.2%), development of sales plan(29.5%), management plan (25.3%), accounting operations (25.7%), and equipment and computer support (18.3%). 124",0,0,0
"Nonlinear Self-Interference Cancellation for Full-Duplex Radios: From Link-Level and System-Level Performance Perspectives
One of the promising technologies for Long Term Evolution is full-duplex radio, an innovation that is expected to double spectral efficiency. To realize full-duplex in practice, the main challenge is overcoming self-interference, and to do so, researchers have developed self-interference cancellation techniques. Since most wireless transceivers use power amplifiers, especially in cellular systems, researchers have revealed the importance of nonlinear self-interference cancellation. In this article, we first explore several nonlinear digital self-interference cancellation techniques. We then propose a low-complexity pre-calibration- based nonlinear digital self-interference cancellation technique. Next, we discuss the issues about reference signal allocation and the overhead of each technique. For performance evaluations, we carry out extensive measurements through a real-time prototype and link-/system-level simulations. For link-level analysis, we measure the amount of cancelled self-interference for each technique. We also evaluate system-level performance through 3D ray-tracing-based simulations. Numerical results confirm the significant performance improvement over a half-duplex system even in interference-limited indoor environments.",0,0,0

"Dynamic Modeling of Bucket-Soil Interactions Using Koopman-DFL Lifting Linearization for Model Predictive Contouring Control of Autonomous Excavators
A lifting-linearization method based on the Koopman operator and Dual Faceted Linearization is applied to the control of a robotic excavator. In excavation, a bucket interacts with the surrounding soil in a highly nonlinear and complex manner. Here, we propose to represent the nonlinear bucket-soil dynamics with a set of linear state equations in a higher-dimensional space. The space of independent state variables is augmented by adding variables associated with nonlinear elements involved in the bucket-soil dynamics. These include nonlinear resistive forces and moment acting on the bucket from the soil, and the effective inertia of the bucket that varies as the soil is captured into the bucket. Variables associated with these nonlinear resistive and inertia elements are treated as additional state variables, and their time evolution is represented as another set of linear differential equations. The lifted linear dynamic model is then applied to Model Predictive Contouring Control, where a cost functional is minimized as a convex optimization problem thanks to the linear dynamics in the lifted space. The lifted linear model is tuned based on a data-driven method by using a soil dynamics simulator. Simulation experiments on homogeneous soil verify the effectiveness of the proposed lifting linearization compared to its counterpart.",1,1,1

Among these maps, the particle-based map offers a solid theoretical basis and the ability to model complex-shaped obstacles. Current particle-based maps describe the occupancy status in discrete grid form and suffer from the grid size problem, namely: large grid size is unfavorable for path planning while small grid size lowers efficiency and causes gaps and inconsistencies. To tackle this problem, this paper generalizes the particle-based map into continuous space and builds an efficient 3D local map. A dual-structure subspace division paradigm, composed of a voxel subspace division and a novel pyramid-like subspace division, is proposed to propagate particles and update the map efficiently with the consideration of occlusions. The occupancy status of an arbitrary point can then be estimated with the cardinality expectation. To reduce the noise in modeling static and dynamic obstacles simultaneously, an initial velocity estimation approach and a mixture model are utilized. Experimental results show that our map can effectively and efficiently model both dynamic obstacles and static obstacles. Compared to the state-of-the-art grid-form particle-based map, our map enables continuous occupancy estimation and substantially improves the performance in different resolutions. We also deployed the map on a quadrotor to demonstrate the bright prospect of using this map in obstacle avoidance tasks of small-scale robotics systems.",0,0,1
"Missing Data Recovery by Exploiting Low-Dimensionality in Power System Synchrophasor Measurements
This paper presents a new framework of recovering missing synchrophasor measurements (erasures). Leveraging the approximate low-rank property of phasor measurement unit (PMU) data, we connect the problem of recovering PMU data erasures with recent advances in low-rank matrix completion methods. Since the existing analysis for matrix completion methods assumes an independent-erasure model that does not capture the correlations in PMU erasures, we propose two models to characterize the temporal and the channel correlations in PMU erasures and provide theoretical guarantees of a matrix completion method in recovering correlated erasures in both models. We also propose an online algorithm that can fill in the missing PMU measurements for real-time applications. Numerical experiments on actual PMU data are conducted to verify the effectiveness of the proposed methods.",0,1,1
"Sample size planning for pilot studies
Pilot studies are often the first step of experimental research. It is usually on a smaller scale and the results can inform intervention development, study feasibility and how the study implementation will play out, if such a larger main study is undertaken. This paper illustrates the relationship between pilot study sample size and the performance study design of main studies. We present two simple sample size calculation methods to ensure adequate study planning for main studies. We use numerical examples and simulations to demonstrate the use and performance of proposed methods. Practical heuristic guidelines are provided based on the results.",1,0,0

Autonomous trucks are expected to fundamentally transform the freight transportation industry. In particular, Autonomous Transfer Hub Networks (ATHN), which combine autonomous trucks on middle miles with humandriven on the first and last miles, are seen as the most likely deployment pathway of this technology. This paper presents three methods to optimize ATHN operations and compares them: a constraint-programming model, a column-generation approach, and a bespoke network flow method. Results on a real case study indicate that the network flow model is highly scalable and outperforms the other two approaches by significant margins.",0,0,0

"Learning quadrupedal locomotion over challenging terrain
A learning-based locomotion controller enables a quadrupedal ANYmal robot to traverse challenging natural environments. Legged locomotion can extend the operational domain of robots to some of the most challenging environments on Earth. However, conventional controllers for legged locomotion are based on elaborate state machines that explicitly trigger the execution of motion primitives and reflexes. These designs have increased in complexity but fallen short of the generality and robustness of animal locomotion. Here, we present a robust controller for blind quadrupedal locomotion in challenging natural environments. Our approach incorporates proprioceptive feedback in locomotion control and demonstrates zero-shot generalization from simulation to natural environments. The controller is trained by reinforcement learning in simulation. The controller is driven by a neural network policy that acts on a stream of proprioceptive signals. The controller retains its robustness under conditions that were never encountered during training: deformable terrains such as mud and snow, dynamic footholds such as rubble, and overground impediments such as thick vegetation and gushing water. The presented work indicates that robust locomotion in natural environments can be achieved by training in simple domains.",0,1,1
"Natural disasters detection in social media and satellite imagery: a survey
The analysis of natural disaster-related multimedia content got great attention in recent years. Being one of the most important sources of information, social media have been crawled over the years to collect and analyze disaster-related multimedia content. Satellite imagery has also been widely explored for disasters analysis. In this paper, we survey the existing literature on disaster detection and analysis of the retrieved information from social media and satellites. Literature on disaster detection and analysis of related multimedia content on the basis of the nature of the content can be categorized into three groups, namely (i) disaster detection in text; (ii) analysis of disaster-related visual content from social media; and (iii) disaster detection in satellite imagery. We extensively review different approaches proposed in these three domains. Furthermore, we also review benchmarking datasets available for the evaluation of disaster detection frameworks. Moreover, we provide a detailed discussion on the insights obtained from the literature review, and identify future trends and challenges, which will provide an important starting point for the researchers in the field.",0,1,0
"Asynchronous Decentralized Federated Learning for Collaborative Fault Diagnosis of PV Stations
Due to the different losses caused by various photovoltaic (PV) array faults, accurate diagnosis of fault types is becoming increasingly important. Compared with a single one, multiple PV stations collect sufficient fault samples, but their data is not allowed to be shared directly due to potential conflicts of interest. Therefore, federated learning can be exploited to train a collaborative fault diagnosis model. However, the modeling efficiency is seriously affected by the model update mechanism since each PV station has a different computing capability and amount of data. Moreover, for the safe and stable operation of the PV system, the robustness of collaborative modeling must be guaranteed rather than simply being processed on a central server. To address these challenges, a novel asynchronous decentralized federated learning (ADFL) framework is proposed. Each PV station not only trains its local model but also participates in collaborative fault diagnosis by exchanging model parameters to improve the generalization without losing accuracy. The global model is aggregated distributedly to avoid central node failure. By designing the asynchronous update scheme, the communication overhead and training time are greatly reduced. Both the experiments and numerical simulations are carried out to verify the effectiveness of the proposed method.",0,1,1
"Laminar spread of a circular liquid jet impinging axially on a rotating disc
The steady laminar annular spread of a thin liquid film generated by a circular jet which impinges perpendicularly in direction of gravity on the centre of a rotating disc is examined both analytically and numerically. Matched asymptotic expansions of the flow quantities provide the proper means for studying the individual flow regimes arising due to the largeness of the Reynolds number formed with the radius of the jet, its slenderness and the relative magnitude of the centrifugal body force. This is measured by a suitably defined Rossby number, $Ro$ . The careful analysis of jet impingement predicts a marked influence of gravity and surface tension on the film flow, considered in the spirit of a shallow-water approach, only through the vorticity imposed by the jet flow. Accordingly, associated downstream conditions are disregarded as the local Froude and Weber numbers are taken to be sufficiently large. Hence, the parabolic problem shaped from the governing equations in a rigorous manner describes the strongly supercritical spread of a developed viscous film past an infinite disc, essentially controlled by $Ro$ . Its numerical solutions are discussed for a wide range of values of $Ro$ . The different flow regimes reflecting varying effects of viscous shear and centrifugal force are elucidated systematically to clarify the surprising richness of flow phenomena. Special attention is paid to the cases $Ro\gg 1$ and $Ro\ll 1$ . The latter, referring to relatively high disc spin, implies a delicate breakdown of the asymptotic flow structure, thus requiring a specific analytical and numerical treatment. Finally, the impact of gravity and capillarity and thus of the disc edge on the film flow is envisaged in brief.",0,0,1
"The Long Arc of Fairness: Formalisations and Ethical Discourse
In recent years, the idea of formalising and modelling fairness for algorithmic decision making (ADM) has advanced to a point of sophisticated specialisation. However, the relations between technical (formalised) and ethical discourse on fairness are not always clear and productive. Arguing for an alternative perspective, we review existing fairness metrics and discuss some common issues. For instance, the fairness of procedures and distributions is often formalised and discussed statically, disregarding both structural preconditions of the status quo and downstream effects of a given intervention. We then introduce dynamic fairness modelling, a more comprehensive approach that realigns formal fairness metrics with arguments from the ethical discourse. A dynamic fairness model incorporates (1) ethical goals, (2) formal metrics to quantify decision procedures and outcomes and (3) mid-term or long-term downstream effects. By contextualising these elements of fairness-related processes, dynamic fairness modelling explicates formerly latent ethical aspects and thereby provides a helpful tool to navigate trade-offs between different fairness interventions. To illustrate the framework, we discuss an example application – the current European efforts to increase the number of women on company boards, e .g. via quota solutions – and present early technical work that fits within our framework.",1,1,0
"A cross-space cascading failure hazard assessment method consideringbetweenness centrality and power loss
In order to accurately assess the hazard caused by cross-space cascading failure in the cyber-physical power system, we propose a quantitative assessment method. This method builds a comprehensive framework of assessment that takes into account the betweenness centrality of attack graph and the consequences of failure. The betweenness centrality of each node in the attack graph is used to characterize the frequency of failure. By calculating the number of all nodes on each attack path, the frequency of a certain fault is calculated. The power loss of physical node caused by each cross-space cascading failure is used to characterize the consequences of the fault, which is combined with the frequency of failure and the urgency of troubleshooting to calculate the hazard assessment value of the cross-space cascading failure. Finally, a variety of cross-space cascading failures are implemented in the simulation environment of local cyber-physical power system and their hazards are evaluated. The effectiveness of the proposed assessment method is verified.",0,1,1

Focusing on autonomous driving algorithm development, this paper proposes a novel real-time trajectory planner formulated as a Nonlinear Model Predictive Control (NMPC) algorithm. The mathematical formulation of the problem is deeply reported and discussed. The numerical solution of the NMPC problem is the result of a novel genetic algorithm strategy that represents the innovative aspect of the work proposed. The aim of this paper is also to show how genetic algorithm can be a valid approach for motion planning strategies.

Moreover, a real-time implementation for research purposes is assumed as possible by considering computational time analysis reported.",0,0,1
"Techno-economic analysis of PV-battery systems in Switzerland
This paper presents a techno-economic optimization model to analyze the economic viability of a photovoltaic battery (PVB) system for different customer groups in Switzerland clustered based on their annual electricity consumption, rooftop size, annual irradiation and location. The simulations for a static investment model are carried out for years 2020-2050 and a comprehensive sensitivity analysis is conducted to investigate the impacts of individual parameters such as costs, load profiles, electricity prices and tariffs, etc. Results show that while combining photovoltaic (PV) with batteries already results in better net present values than PV alone for some customer groups today, the payback periods fluctuate between 2020 and 2035 due to the mixed effects of policy changes, costs and electricity price developments. The optimal PV and battery sizes increase over time and in 2050 the PV investment is mostly limited by the rooftop size. The economic viability of PVB system investments varies between different customer groups and the most attractive investment (i.e., that has the shortest payback period) is mostly accessible to customer groups with higher annual irradiation and electricity demand. In addition, investment decisions are highly sensitive to payback periods, future costs, electricity prices and tariff developments. Lastly, the grid impact of the PVB system deployments are investigated by analyzing the residual Swiss system load profiles. The dynamics of residual load profiles caused by the seasonal, daily and hourly patterns of the solar generation emphasizes the need for flexible resources with fast ramping capabilities.",0,0,1

"The gig economy in Poland: evidence based on mobile big data
In this article we address the question of how to measure the size and characteristics of the platform economy. We propose a different, to sample surveys, approach based on smartphone data, which are passively collected through programmatic systems as part of online marketing. In particular, in our study we focus on two types of services: food delivery (Bolt Courier, Takeaway, Glover, Wolt and transport services (Bolt Driver, Free Now, iTaxi and Uber). Our results show that the platform economy in Poland is growing. In particular, with respect to food delivery and transportation services performed by means of applications, we observed a growing trend between January 2018 and December 2020. Taking into account the demographic structure of apps users, our results confirm findings from past studies: the majority of platform workers are young men but the age structure of app users is different for each of the two categories of services. Another surprising finding is that foreigners do not account for the majority of gig workers in Poland. When the number of platform workers is compared with corresponding working populations, the estimated share of active app users accounts for about 0.5–2% of working populations in 9 largest Polish cities.",1,1,0
"Rapid seismic damage evaluation of bridge portfolios using machine learning techniques
Abstract The damage state of a bridge has significant implications on the post-earthquake emergency traffic and recovery operations and is critical to identify the post-earthquake damage states without much delay. Currently, the damage states are identified either based on visual inspection or pre-determined fragility curves. Although these methodologies can provide useful information, the timely application of these methodologies for large scale regional damage assessments is often limited due to the manual or computational efforts. This paper proposes a methodology for the rapid damage state assessment (green, yellow, or red) of bridges utilizing the capabilities of machine learning techniques. Contrary to the existing methods, the proposed methodology accounts for bridge-specific attributes in the damage state assessment. The proposed methodology is demonstrated using two-span box-girder bridges in California. The prediction model is established using the training set, and the performance of the model is evaluated using the test set. It is noted that the machine learning algorithm called Random Forest provides better performance for the selected bridges, and its tagging accuracy ranges from 73% to 82% depending on the bridge configuration under consideration. The proposed methodology revealed that input parameters such as span length and reinforcement ratio in addition to the ground motion intensity parameter have a significant influence on the expected damage state.",0,1,1
"Cyber Risk Analysis of Combined Data Attacks Against Power System State Estimation
Understanding smart grid cyber attacks is key for developing appropriate protection and recovery measures. Advanced attacks pursue maximized impact at minimized costs and detectability. This paper conducts risk analysis of combined data integrity and availability attacks against the power system state estimation. We compare the combined attacks with pure integrity attacks—false data injection (FDI) attacks. A security index for vulnerability assessment to these two kinds of attacks is proposed and formulated as a mixed integer linear programming problem. We show that such combined attacks can succeed with fewer resources than FDI attacks. The combined attacks with limited knowledge of the system model also expose advantages in keeping stealth against the bad data detection. Finally, the risk of combined attacks to reliable system operation is evaluated using the results from vulnerability assessment and attack impact analysis. The findings in this paper are validated and supported by a detailed case study.",0,1,1
"From the Test Benches to the First Prototype of the muFly Micro Helicopter
The goal of the European project muFly is to build a fully autonomous micro helicopter, which is comparable to a small bird in size and mass. The rigorous size and mass constraints infer various problems related to energy efficiency, flight stability and overall system design. In this research, aerodynamics and flight dynamics are investigated experimentally to gather information for the design of the helicopter’s propulsion group and steering system. Several test benches are designed and built for these investigations. A coaxial rotor test bench is used to measure the thrust and drag torque of different rotor blade designs. The effects of cyclic pitching of the swash plate and the passive stabilizer bar are studied on a test bench measuring rotor forces and moments with a 6–axis force sensor. The gathered knowledge is used to design a first prototype of the muFly helicopter. The prototype is described in terms of rotor configuration, structure, actuator and sensor selection according to the project demands, and a first version of the helicopter is shown.

"SDN‐based resource allocation in MPLS networks: A hybrid approach
The highly dynamic nature of the current network traffics makes the network managers to exploit the flexibility of the state‐of‐the‐art paradigm called SDN. In this way, there has been an increasing interest in hybrid networks of SDN‐MPLS. In this paper, a new traffic engineering architecture for SDN‐MPLS network is proposed. To this end, OpenFlow‐enabled switches are applied over the edge of the network to improve flow‐level management flexibility while MPLS routers are considered as the core of the network to make the scheme applicable for existing MPLS networks. The proposed scheme re‐assigns flows to the Label‐Switched Paths (LSPs) to highly utilize the network resources. In the cases that the flow‐level re‐routing is insufficient, the proposed scheme re‐computes and re‐creates the undergoing LSPs. To this end, we mathematically formulate two optimization problems, ie, i) flow re‐routing and ii) LSP re‐creation, and propose a heuristic algorithm to improve the performance of the scheme. Our experimental results show the efficiency of the proposed hybrid SDN‐MPLS architecture in traffic engineering superiors traditionally deployed MPLS networks.",0,0,0
"Cascading failure model and robustness of heterogeneous interdependent combat network
The networked combat system-of-system (CSOS) is the trend of combat development with the innovation of technology. The achievement of combat eﬀectiveness requires CSOS to have a good ability to deal with external interference. From the perspective of complex networks, the modeling of CSOS is carried out, and the robustness of the combat network is explored based on this. Firstly, a more realistic double-layer heterogeneous interdependent combat network model is established. Then, the conditional group dependency situation is considered to design failure rules for dependent failure, and the coupling relation between the double-layer subnets is analysed for cascading failure. Furthermore, the initial load and capacity of the node are deﬁned, respectively, as well as the load redistribution strategy and the status judgment rules for the cascading failure model. Simulation experiments are carried out by changing the attack modes and diﬀerent parameters, and the results show that the robustness of the combat network can be eﬀectively improved by improving the tolerance limit of one-way dependency of the functional net, the node capacity of the functional net and the tolerance of the overload state. The conclusions of this paper can provide a useful reference for the network structure optimization and network security protection in military ﬁeld. the robustness of the combat network.

"A Mechanical System Inspired Microscopic Traffic Model: Modeling, Analysis, and Validation
In this paper, we develop a mechanical system inspired microscopic traffic model to characterize the longitudinal interaction dynamics among a chain of vehicles. In particular, we extend our prior work on mass-spring-damper-clutch based car-following model between two vehicles to multi-vehicle scenario. This model can naturally capture the driver's tendency to maintain the same speed as the vehicle ahead while keeping a (speed-dependent) desired spacing. It is also capable of characterizing the impact of the following vehicle on the preceding vehicle, which is generally neglected in existing models. A new string stability criterion is defined for the considered multi-vehicle dynamics, and stability analysis is performed on the system parameters and time delays. An efficient online parameter identification algorithm, sequential recursive least squares with inverse QR decomposition (SRLS-IQR), is developed to estimate the driving-related model parameters. These real-time estimated parameters can be employed in advanced longitudinal control systems to enable accurate prediction of vehicle trajectories for improved safety and fuel efficiency. The proposed model and the parameter identification algorithm are validated on NGSIM, a naturalistic driving dataset, as well as our own connected vehicle driving data. Promising performance is demonstrated.",0,1,1
"ERASOR: Egocentric Ratio of Pseudo Occupancy-Based Dynamic Object Removal for Static 3D Point Cloud Map Building
Scan data of urban environments often include representations of dynamic objects, such as vehicles, pedestrians, and so forth. However, when it comes to constructing a 3D point cloud map with sequential accumulations of the scan data, the dynamic objects often leave unwanted traces in the map. These traces of dynamic objects act as obstacles and thus impede mobile vehicles from achieving good localization and navigation performances. To tackle the problem, this letter presents a novel static map building method called ERASOR, Egocentric RAtio of pSeudo Occupancy-based dynamic object Removal, which is fast and robust to motion ambiguity. Our approach directs its attention to the nature of most dynamic objects in urban environments being inevitably in contact with the ground. Accordingly, we propose the novel concept called pseudo occupancy to express the occupancy of unit space and then discriminate spaces of varying occupancy. Finally, Region-wise Ground Plane Fitting (R-GPF) is adopted to distinguish static points from dynamic points within the candidate bins that potentially contain dynamic points. As experimentally verified on SemanticKITTI, our proposed method yields promising performance against state-of-the-art methods overcoming the limitations of existing ray tracing-based and visibility-based methods.",0,1,1

"AP-initiated Multi-User Transmissions in IEEE 802.11ax WLANs
Abstract Next-generation IEEE 802.11ax Wireless Local Area Networks (WLANs) will make extensive use of multi-user communications in both Downlink (DL) and Uplink (UL) directions to achieve high and efficient spectrum utilization in scenarios with many user stations per access point. It will become possible with the support of Multiuser (MU) Multiple Input, Multiple output (MIMO) and Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiple Access (OFDMA) transmissions. In this paper, we first overview the novel characteristics introduced by IEEE 802.11ax to implement AP-initiated OFDMA and multiuser MIMO (MU-MIMO) transmissions in both DL and UL directions. Namely, we describe the changes made at the Physical (PHY) layer and at the Medium Access Control (MAC) layer to support OFDMA, the use of trigger frames to schedule uplink multi-user transmissions, and the new multiuser RTS/CTS mechanism to protect large multi-user transmissions from collisions.

Results show the advantages of using MU transmissions in scenarios with many user stations.

"Microfabricated Neuroaccelerometer: Integrating Sensing and Reservoir Computing in MEMS
This study presents the design, fabrication, and test of a micro accelerometer with intrinsic processing capabilities, that integrates the functions of sensing and computing in the same MEMS. The device consists of an inertial mass electrostatically coupled to an oscillating beam through a gap of 8 $\mu \text{m}$ . The motion of the inertial mass modulates an AC electrostatic field that drives the beam in its non-linear regime. This non-linearity is used to implement machine learning in the mechanical domain, using reservoir computing with delayed feedback to process the acceleration information provided by the inertial mass. The device is microfabricated on a silicon-on-insulator substrate using conventional MEMS processes. Dynamic characterization showed good accelerometer functionalities, with an inertial mass sensitivity on the order of 100 mV/g from 250 to 1300 Hz and a natural frequency of 1.7 kHz. In order to test the device computing capabilities, two different machine learning benchmarks were implemented, with the inputs fed to the device as accelerations. The neuromorphic MEMS accelerometer was able to accurately emulate non-linear autoregressive moving average models and compute the parity of random bit streams. These results were obtained in a test system with a non-trivial transfer function, showing a robustness that is well-suited to anticipated applications. [2019-0238]",0,1,1

Additionally, ߡ-MILP leverages a heuristic to balance mission satisfaction and allows to prioritize certain missions in special scenarios including emergencies and landings. Numerical validations demonstrate that ߡ-MILP now satisfies 100% of the requested constraints and provides fair schedules amongst missions with respect to the state-of-the-art for the most oversubscribed weeks of the years 2016 and 2018.",0,1,0
"Real-World Uplift Modelling with Significance-Based Uplift Trees
This paper seeks to document the current state of the art in ‘uplift modelling’—the practice of modelling the change in behaviour that results directly from a specified treatment such as a marketing intervention. We include details of the SignificanceBased Uplift Trees that have formed the core of the only packaged uplift modelling software currently available. The paper includes a summary of some of the results that have been delivered using uplift modelling in practice, with examples drawn from demand-stimulation and customer-retention applications. It also surveys and discusses approaches to each of the major stages involved in uplift modelling—variable selection, model construction, quality measures and postcampaign evaluation—all of which require different approaches from traditional response modelling.",0,1,0
"Survival Random Forest to Predict Time to Fill
Traditionally, the time-to-fill metric is used as a scorecard for past performance. An organization may use time to fill to assess the performance of its internal recruiting team, or as a way to set service level agreements with outsourced recruiting partners. By first developing a set of quantifiable job features and then applying survival analysis to historical time-to-fill data, we build a predictor to assess the probability a job will remain open beyond its target time-to-fill date, enabling us to commit additional resources to high risk jobs at the beginning of the recruiting process.",0,1,0
"Understanding the Distributional Impacts of Vehicle Policy: Who Buys New and Used Alternative Vehicles?
This research project explores the plug-in electric vehicle (PEV) market, including both Battery Electric Vehicles (BEVs) and Plug-in Hybrid Electric Vehicles (PHEVs), and the sociodemographic characteristics of purchasing households. The authors use detailed micro-level data on PEV purchase records to answer two primary research questions. Their results confirm that low-income households exhibit a lower share of PEV purchases than they do for conventional, internal combustion engine (ICE) vehicles. Households with annual income less than $50,000 comprise 33 percent of ICE purchases and only 14 percent of PEVS. By comparison, high-income households earning more than $150,000 annually comprise only 12 percent of ICE purchases and 35 percent of PEV purchases over their sample period. Similarly, unsurprising patterns can be seen across ethnicities. For example, non-Hispanic Whites represent 41 percent of ICE purchases but 55 percent of PEV purchases, as compared to Hispanics (38 percent of ICE and 10 percent of PEVs) and African Americans (3 percent of ICEs and 2 percent of PEVS). These differences naturally raise questions about barriers to PEV adoption among low-income and minority ethnic populations. By comparing outcomes in the ICE, hybrid, and PEV markets across income and ethnic groups, the authors are able to test whether price discrimination and barriers to market access are higher in PEV markets for low-income and minority ethnic groups. The authors find that, overall, they are not, although there are mixed results for the used PEV market. In general, non-white, low-income populations face higher prices in the used PEV market, relative to a baseline, than they do in the new PEV market. While some people travel farther to buy used PEVs than they do to buy used ICE vehicles, there is not a pattern that would indicate systematic discrimination (e.g. Hispanics travel farther to buy used PHEVs but less far to buy used BEVs). While the authors admit that their empirical approach cannot control for all potential vehicle composition effects, the authors view their results as being most consistent with a market that provides access to all ethnicities and income groups.

"Reinforcement Learning based Dynamic Model Selection for Short-Term Load Forecasting
With the growing prevalence of smart grid technology, short-term load forecasting (STLF) becomes particularly important in power system operations. There is a large collection of methods developed for STLF, but selecting a suitable method under varying conditions is still challenging. This paper develops a novel reinforcement learning based dynamic model selection (DMS) method for STLF. A forecasting model pool is first built, including ten state-of-the-art machine learning based forecasting models. Then a Q-learning agent learns the optimal policy of selecting the best forecasting model for the next time step, based on the model performance. The optimal DMS policy is applied to select the best model at each time step with a moving window. Numerical simulations on two-year load and weather data show that the Q-learning algorithm converges fast, resulting in effective and efficient DMS. The developed STLF model with Q-learning based DMS improves the forecasting accuracy by approximately 50%, compared to the state-of-the-art machine learning based STLF models.",1,0,1
"Robust Quadrupedal Locomotion on Sloped Terrains: A Linear Policy Approach
In this paper, with a view toward fast deployment of locomotion gaits in low-cost hardware, we use a linear policy for realizing end-foot trajectories in the quadruped robot, Stoch $2$. In particular, the parameters of the end-foot trajectories are shaped via a linear feedback policy that takes the torso orientation and the terrain slope as inputs. The corresponding desired joint angles are obtained via an inverse kinematics solver and tracked via a PID control law. Augmented Random Search, a model-free and a gradient-free learning algorithm is used to train this linear policy. Simulation results show that the resulting walking is robust to external pushes and terrain slope variations. This methodology is not only computationally light-weight but also uses minimal sensing and actuation capabilities in the robot, thereby justifying the approach.",0,0,1
"Task-Oriented Optimal Sequencing of Visualization Charts
A chart sequence is used to describe a series of visualization charts generated in the exploratory analysis by data analysts. It provides information details in each chart as well as a logical relationship among charts. While existing research targets suggesting chart sequences that match human’s perceptions, little attention has been paid to formulate task-oriented connections between charts in a chart design space. We present a novel chart sequencing method based on reinforcement learning to capture the connections between charts in the context of three major analysis tasks, including correlation analysis, anomaly detection, and cluster analysis. The proposed method formulates a chart sequencing procedure as an optimization problem, which seeks an optimal policy to sequencing charts for the specific analysis task. In our method, a novel reward function is introduced, which takes both the analysis task and the factor of human cognition into consideration. We conducted one case study and two user studies to evaluate the effectiveness of our method under the application scenarios of visualization recommendation, sequencing charts for reasoning analysis results, and making a chart design choice. The study results showed the power of our method.",0,1,0
"Microgrid: Architecture, policy and future trends
Future electricity network must be flexible, accessible, reliable and economically viable to realise the aims of the smart grid initiative. In order to achieve these objectives and to reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, research on various configurations or architectures of microgrid (µGrid) systems is gaining greater attention. This is occurring in step with increasing penetration of Renewable Energy Sources (RES) such as solar, wind and other micro-sources. Energy storage can also be a part of the µGrid architecture to ensure more stable and sustainable operation. The techno-economic viability of the µGrid system is also a point of concern. Again, the variable and uncontrollable behaviour of RES can also introduce power quality problems. To improve the systems reliability, efficiency and power quality, different µGrid architectures are introduced. Complex control of the µGrid controller is helping to overcome these conditions. In that case, integration of Custom Power Devices is also playing an important role. Therefore, µGrid policies should also deal with these issues in the light of future trends towards the Smart Grid. This paper presents a literature review, based on various existing and/or simulated µGrid architectures. In relation to the reliability, efficiency and power quality issues, different distribution systems have been introduced. The advantages and disadvantages of these configurations are discussed here. The benefits of RES and its associated power quality problems have been identified. The benefits of energy storage systems and the development of communication systems towards the stable, flexible and efficient operation of smart grids are also reviewed. Findings have been outlined and then the policies with future trends of µGrid are also discussed.",0,1,1
"Do practitioners intentionally self-fix Technical Debt and why?
The impact of Technical Debt (TD) on software maintenance and evolution is of great concern, but recent evidence shows that a considerable amount of TD is fixed by the same developers who introduced it; this is termed self-fixed TD. This characteristic of TD management can potentially impact team dynamics and practices in managing TD. However, the initial evidence is based on low-level source code analysis; this casts some doubt whether practitioners repay their own debt intentionally and under what circumstances. To address this gap, we conducted an online survey on 17 well-known Java and Python open-source software communities to investigate practitioners' intent and rationale for self-fixing technical debt. We also investigate the relationship between human-related factors (e.g., experience) and self-fixing. The results, derived from the responses of 181 participants, show that a majority addresses their own debt consciously and often. Moreover, those with a higher level of involvement (e.g., more experience in the project and number of contributions) tend to be more concerned about self-fixing TD. We also learned that the sense of responsibility is a common self-fixing driver and that decisions to fix TD are not superficial but consider balancing costs and benefits, among other factors. The findings in this paper can lead to improving TD prevention and management strategies.",0,0,0
"Towards Algorithmic Transparency: A Diversity Perspective
As the role of algorithmic systems and processes increases in society, so does the risk of bias, which can result in discrimination against individuals and social groups. Research on algorithmic bias has exploded in recent years, highlighting both the problems of bias, and the potential solutions, in terms of algorithmic transparency (AT). Transparency is important for facilitating fairness management as well as explainability in algorithms; however, the concept of diversity, and its relationship to bias and transparency, has been largely left out of the discussion. We reflect on the relationship between diversity and bias, arguing that diversity drives the need for transparency. Using a perspective-taking lens, which takes diversity as a given, we propose a conceptual framework to characterize the problem and solution spaces of AT, to aid its application in algorithmic systems. Example cases from three research domains are described using our framework.",1,1,0
"Autonomous Charging of Electric Vehicle Fleets to Enhance Renewable Generation Dispatchability
A total 19% of generation capacity in California is offered by PV units and over some months, more than 10% of this energy is curtailed. In this research, a novel approach to reduce renewable generation curtailments and increasing system flexibility by means of electric vehicles’ charging coordination is represented. The presented problem is a sequential decision making process, and is solved by fitted Q-iteration algorithm which unlike other reinforcement learning methods, needs fewer episodes of learning. Three case studies are presented to validate the effectiveness of the proposed approach. These cases include aggregator load following, ramp service and utilization of nondeterministic PV generation. The results suggest that through this framework, EVs successfully learn how to adjust their charging schedule in stochastic scenarios where their trip times, as well as solar power generation are unknown beforehand.",0,1,1
"Industry 4.0 and Prospects of Circular Economy: A Survey of Robotic Assembly and Disassembly
Despite their contributions to the financial efficiency and environmental sustainability of industrial processes, robotic assembly and disassembly have been understudied in the existing literature. This is in contradiction to their importance in realizing the Fourth Industrial Revolution. More specifically, although most of the literature has extensively discussed how to optimally assemble or disassemble given products, the role of other factors has been overlooked. For example, the types of robots involved in implementing the sequence plans, which should ideally be taken into account throughout the whole chain consisting of design, assembly, disassembly and reassembly. Isolating the foregoing operations from the rest of the components of the relevant ecosystems may lead to erroneous inferences toward both the necessity and efficiency of the underlying procedures. In this paper we try to alleviate these shortcomings by comprehensively investigating the state-of-the-art in robotic assembly and disassembly. We consider and review various aspects of manufacturing and remanufacturing frameworks while particularly focusing on their desirability for supporting a circular economy.",0,0,0
"Inverse Design of Single- and Multi-Rotor Horizontal Axis Wind Turbine Blades using Computational Fluid Dynamics
A method for inverse design of horizontal axis wind turbines (HAWTs) is presented in this paper. The direct solver for aerodynamic analysis solves the Reynolds Averaged Navier Stokes (RANS) equations, where the effect of the turbine rotor is modeled as momentum sources using the actuator disk model (ADM); this approach is referred to as RANS/ADM. The inverse problem is posed as follows: for a given selection of airfoils, the objective is to find the blade geometry (described as blade twist and chord distributions) which realizes the desired turbine aerodynamic performance at the design point; the desired performance is prescribed as angle of attack ($\alpha$) and axial induction factor ($a$) distributions along the blade. An iterative approach is used. An initial estimate of blade geometry is used with the direct solver (RANS/ADM) to obtain $\alpha$ and $a$. The differences between the calculated and desired values of $\alpha$ and $a$ are computed and a new estimate for the blade geometry (chord and twist) is obtained via nonlinear least squares regression using the Trust-Region-Reflective (TRF) method. This procedure is continued until the difference between the calculated and the desired values is within acceptable tolerance. The method is demonstrated for conventional, single-rotor HAWTs and then extended to multi-rotor, specifically dual-rotor wind turbines. The TRF method is also compared with the multi-dimensional Newton iteration method and found to provide better convergence when constraints are imposed in blade design, although faster convergence is obtained with the Newton method for unconstrained optimization.",1,1,1
"A 60-GHz 144-Element Phased-Array Transceiver for Backhaul Application
A 144-element phased array transceiver is realized using a modular tiled approach that supports 802.11ad, MCS12 single carrier 16-quadratic-amplitude modulation (QAM) 4.6 Gbps, in the 60-GHz band. It consists of a system-on-a chip (SOC) (MAC/PHY/BB to IF) in 28-nm CMOS, and one IF-to-60-GHz transceiver master chip driving twelve 60-GHz phased array transceiver slave chips fabricated in a 40-nm CMOS. Using the master-slave configuration, the 60-GHz transceiver with 12 phase-controlled TX/RX slices is expanded to 144 phase-controlled slices. Each final TX/RX slice is then connected to two patch antennas on LTCC substrate. A tiled approach is used to create the 288 patch antenna array out of six identical tiles each with two slave 60-GHz transceivers connected to a 48-element antenna array. The single tile phased array with 48 antennas has a measured beam steering scan angle of 60° in azimuth and 10° in elevation. The full phased array transceiver with 288 antennas has a measured over the air (OTA) max effective isotropic radiated power (EIRP) of 51 dBm at saturated power (PSAT), and EIRP of 44.8 dBm with −22 dB EVM for MCS12 (16QAM-4.6 Gbps) at broadside. It has an OTA measured sensitivity of −87.3 and −80.4 dBm for MCS9 (QPSK-2.5 Gbps) and MCS12, respectively, at broadside. A packet error rate of 10−5 was measured for MCS9 and MCS12 with an OTA input power of −85 and −77.5 dBm, respectively, for the full phased array transceiver at broadside.",0,0,0

"Influence of trust and risk on peer-to-peer investment willingness: a bidirectional perspective
PurposeThe purpose of this paper is to investigate the influence of trust and perceived risk on investment willingness considering the bidirectional relationship between trust and perceived risk in peer-to-peer (P2P) lending.Design/methodology/approachData were collected from a leading Chinese P2P platform, PPDAI.com. In total, 328 valid responses were received and analyzed using structural equation modeling (SEM).FindingsThe results show that the influence of trust on investment willingness is significant, whereas that of perceived risk is insignificant. The results also indicate that platform reputation has a positive effect on trust, and the quality of alternatives is positively associated with perceived risk. In addition, the bidirectional perspective should be preferred to cope with the bidirectional relationship between trust and perceived risk in P2P lending.Originality/valueThis study extends existing research on the influence of trust and perceived risk on investment willingness from a bidirectional perspective, which has not been addressed in the P2P lending context. In addition, this research enriches the current literature about trust and perceived risk by providing more evidence that the relationship between trust and perceived risk is bidirectional and thus the bidirectional model should be preferred. For practice, the study suggests that managers can earn trust and reduce the perceived risk of lenders by continuously providing high-quality products, services and enhancing platform reputation, ultimately improving their investment willingness.",0,1,0
"Lithium-ion battery degradation: how to model it.
Predicting lithium-ion battery degradation is worth billions to the global automotive, aviation and energy storage industries, to improve performance and safety and reduce warranty liabilities. However, very few published models of battery degradation explicitly consider the interactions between more than two degradation mechanisms, and none do so within a single electrode. In this paper, the first published attempt to directly couple more than two degradation mechanisms in the negative electrode is reported. The results are used to map different pathways through the complicated path dependent and non-linear degradation space. Four degradation mechanisms are coupled in PyBaMM, an open source modelling environment uniquely developed to allow new physics to be implemented and explored quickly and easily. Crucially it is possible to see 'inside the model and observe the consequences of the different patterns of degradation, such as loss of lithium inventory and loss of active material. For the same cell, five different pathways that can result in end-of-life have already been found, depending on how the cell is used. Such information would enable a product designer to either extend life or predict life based upon the usage pattern. However, parameterization of the degradation models remains as a major challenge, and requires the attention of the international battery community.",0,1,1
"The challenges and alternatives of water supply and sanitation in flood prone area: A case study for Bhuapur in Bangladesh
Bangladesh is a riverine country and frequently affected by floods. Depending on location and sanitation conditions, drinking water sources are often contaminated during flood and many waterborne diseases like dysentery, diarrhea, typhoid etc. spread out. This research investigates potable water and sanitation condition in a flood affected area at Bhuapur in Tangail, Bangladesh. The various parameters such as colour (25 TCU), turbidity (128 NTU), total coliform (1800/100 ml) and faecal coliform (80/100 ml) for raw water collected from Halda river and during flood is much higher as compared to the Bangladesh standard limit. It is recommended that fabricated biosand filter should be used at flood prone area because it can significantly remove impurities such as turbidity over 95.28% and 87.82% for Halda river and flooded tubewell water respectively. The test results for other parameters like colour, total and faecal coliform have been compared with WHO guide lines and Bangladesh standards and found within the acceptable limits. Besides, alternative sanitary latrines have also been suggested to protect sanitation during flood.",0,0,1
"Real-time simulation of parameter-dependent fluid flows through deep learning-based reduced order models
Simulating fluid flows in different virtual scenarios is of key importance in engineering applications. However, high-fidelity, full-order models relying, e.g., on the finite element method, are unaffordable whenever fluid flows must be simulated in almost real-time. Reduced order models (ROMs) relying, e.g., on proper orthogonal decomposition (POD) provide reliable approximations to parameter-dependent fluid dynamics problems in rapid times. However, they might require expensive hyper-reduction strategies for handling parameterized nonlinear terms, and enriched reduced spaces (or Petrov–Galerkin projections) if a mixed velocity–pressure formulation is considered, possibly hampering the evaluation of reliable solutions in real-time. Dealing with fluid–structure interactions entails even greater difficulties. The proposed deep learning (DL)-based ROMs overcome all these limitations by learning, in a nonintrusive way, both the nonlinear trial manifold and the reduced dynamics. To do so, they rely on deep neural networks, after performing a former dimensionality reduction through POD, enhancing their training times substantially. The resulting POD-DL-ROMs are shown to provide accurate results in almost real-time for the flow around a cylinder benchmark, the fluid–structure interaction between an elastic beam attached to a fixed, rigid block and a laminar incompressible flow, and the blood flow in a cerebral aneurysm.",1,1,1
"Audiovisual Translation through NMT and Subtitling in the Netflix Series ‘Cable Girls’
In recent years, the emergence of streaming platforms such as Netflix, HBO or Amazon Prime Video has reshaped the field of entertainment, which increasingly relies on subtitling, dubbing or voice-over modes. However, little is known about audiovisual translation when dealing with Neural Machine Translation (NMT) engines. This work-in-progress paper seeks to examine the English subtitles of the first episode of the popular Spanish Netflix series Cable Girls and the translated version generated by Google Translate and DeepL. Such analysis will help us determine whether there are significant linguistic differences that could lead to miscomprehension or cultural shocks. To this end, the corpus compiled consists of the Spanish script, the English subtitles available in Netflix and the translated version of the script. For the analysis of the data, errors have been classified following the DQF/MQM Error typology and have been evaluated with the automatic BLEU metric. Results show that NMT engines offer good-quality translations, which in turn may benefit translators working with audiovisual entertainment resources.",0,1,0

"Review of Motion Blur Estimation Techniques
The goal of image restoration is to improve a given image in some predefined sense. Restoration attempts to recover an image by modelling the degradation function and applying the inverse process. Motion blur is a common type of degradation which is caused by the relative motion between an object and camera. Motion blur can be modeled by a point spread function consists of two parameters angle and length. Accurate estimation of these parameters is required in case of blind restoration of motion blurred images. This paper compares different approaches to estimate the parameters of a motion blur namely direction and length directly from the observed image with and without the influence of Gaussian noise. These estimated motion blur parameters can then be used in a standard nonblind deconvolution algorithm. Simulation results compare the performance of most common motion blur estimation methods.",0,0,1
"Open-switch Fault-tolerant Control of Power Converters in a Grid-connected Photovoltaic System
This paper presents the study of an open switch fault tolerant control of a grid-connected photovoltaic system. The studied system is based on the classical DC–DC boost converter and a bidirectional 6-pulse DC–AC converter. The objective is to provide an open-switch fault detection method and fault-tolerant control for both of boost converter and grid-side converter (GSC) in a grid-connected photovoltaic system. A fast fault detection method and a reliable fault-tolerant topology are required to ensure continuity of service, and achieve a faster corrective maintenance. In this work, the mean value of the error voltages is used as fault indicator for the GSC, while, for the boost converter the inductor current form is used as fault indicator. The fault-tolerant topology was achieved by adding one redundant switch to the boost converter, and by adding one redundant leg to the GSC. The results of the fault tolerant control are presented and discussed to validate the proposed approach under different scenarios and different solar irradiances.",0,1,1
"A simplified electro-chemical lithium-ion battery model applicable for in-situ monitoring and online controlling
The penetration of lithium-ion batteries (LIBs) in transport, energy and communication systems is increasing rapidly. A meticulous LIB model applicable for precise in situ monitoring and convenient online control is sought to bridge the gap between research and applications. On the basis of the classic pseudo-two-dimensional (P2D) model, a simplified electro-chemical model for LIBs that is adaptive to variant working environments and materials is proposed. Specifically, a bottom-up approach is adopted to decompose the complex P2Dmodel into decoupled sub-models, including the time-variant parameter model, solution-phase migration model, solid-phase diffusion model, reaction distribution model and output model. The simplification schemes of different sub-models are developed independently and finally reassembled. For ease of online simulation and control in real-world implementations, a discrete-time state-space realization of the proposed model is derived. A full-cycle simulation framework, including the initialization process, stabilization method and closed-loop correction scheme, is designed as well. Numerical experiments for the commonly used NCM and LFP cells in different operating scenarios demonstrate that the proposed model can accurately predict battery output along with the spatial distribution of internal states with limited computation resources, which provides opportunities for degradation analysis and meticulous management of LIBs in practice.",1,1,1
"A Survey on Ethical Principles of AI and Implementations
AI has powerful capabilities in prediction, automation, planning, targeting, and personalisation. Generally, it is assumed that AI can enable machines to exhibit human-like intelligence, and is claimed to benefit to different areas of our lives. Since AI is fueled by data and is a distinct form of autonomous and self-learning agency, we are seeing increasing ethical concerns related to AI uses. In order to mitigate various ethical concerns, national and international organisations including governmental organisations, private sectors as well as research institutes have made extensive efforts by drafting ethical principles of AI, and having active discussions on ethics of AI within and beyond the AI community. This paper investigates these efforts with a focus on the identification of fundamental ethical principles of AI and their implementations. The review found that there is a convergence around limited principles and the most prevalent principles are transparency, justice and fairness, responsibility, non-maleficence, and privacy. The investigation suggests that ethical principles need to be combined with every stages of the AI lifecycle in the implementation to ensure that the AI system is designed, implemented and deployed in an ethical manner. Similar to ethical framework used in biomedical and clinical research, this paper suggests checklist-style questionnaires as benchmarks for the implementation of ethical principles of AI.",0,0,0
"Lithium-Ion Battery Internal Resistance Measurement Application in State-of-Charge Estimation Using the Extended Kalman Filter
The lithium-ion battery is a viable power source for hybrid electric vehicles (HEVs) and, more recently, electric vehicles (EVs). Its performance, especially in terms of state of charge (SOC), plays a significant role in the energy management of these vehicles. The extended Kalman filter (EKF) is widely used to estimate online SOC as an efficient estimation algorithm. However, conventional EKF algorithms cannot accurately estimate the difference between individual batteries, which should not be ignored. However, the internal resistance of a battery can represent this difference. Therefore, this work proposes using an EKF with internal resistance measurement based on the conventional algorithm. Lithium-ion battery real-time resistances can help the Kalman filter overcome defects from simplistic battery models. In addition, experimental results show that it is useful to introduce online internal resistance to the estimation of SOC.",0,0,1
"SMA active fiber pumps inspired by the squid mantle
Squid possess a mantle that is able to quickly compress an internal fluid, thus providing a jetting locomotion that enables them to be the fastest aquatic invertebrates. The mantle possesses a complex collagen fiber and muscular system, and the primary propulsion is accomplished through circumferential muscles (90°) contracting around the mantel. In addition, jetting is enhanced through elastic energy stored in the helically-wound IM-1 collagen fibers. The angles of these fibers have been measured between 28° and 32° in different species of squid. Inspired by the muscular fiber configuration found in the mantle of squid, novel pumps that use shape memory alloy (SMA) active fibers oriented at precise angles around a cylindrical shell are investigated through experiments and analytical studies. A thermomechanical model of an SMA fiber is presented and the parameters are identified through experiments. Using the thermomechanical model of the SMA fiber, an analytical model of the SMA active fiber pump is presented and is validated through experiments. Results show that maximum pumping power and efficiency is achieved for pumps when the matrix modulus is less than the fiber modulus and the optimal fiber wind angle is ±55°. When the matrix modulus is similar to the fiber modulus, maximum pumping performance is achieved with a wind angle of ±90°, similar to the angle of the circumferential muscles in the squid mantel.",0,0,1

"Fighting Accounting Fraud Through Forensic Data Analytics
Accounting fraud is a global concern representing a significant threat to the financial system stability due to the resulting diminishing of the market confidence and trust of regulatory authorities. Several tricks can be used to commit accounting fraud, hence the need for non-static regulatory interventions that take into account different fraudulent patterns. Accordingly, this study aims to improve the detection of accounting fraud via the implementation of several machine learning methods to better differentiate between fraud and non-fraud companies, and to further assist the task of examination within the riskier firms by evaluating relevant financial indicators. Out-of-sample results suggest there is a great potential in detecting falsified financial statements through statistical modelling and analysis of publicly available accounting information. The proposed methodology can be of assistance to public auditors and regulatory agencies as it facilitates auditing processes, and supports more targeted and effective examinations of accounting reports.",0,1,0
"Uncovering near-wall blood flow from sparse data with physics-informed neural networks
Near-wall blood flow and wall shear stress (WSS) regulate major forms of cardiovascular disease, yet they are challenging to quantify with high fidelity. Patient-specific computational and experimental measurement of WSS suffers from uncertainty, low resolution, and noise issues. Physics-informed neural networks (PINN) provide a flexible deep learning framework to integrate mathematical equations governing blood flow with measurement data. By leveraging knowledge about the governing equations (herein, Navier-Stokes), PINN overcomes the large data requirement in deep learning. In this study, it was shown how PINN could be used to improve WSS quantification in diseased arterial flows. Specifically, blood flow problems where the inlet and outlet boundary conditions were not known were solved by assimilating very few measurement points. Uncertainty in boundary conditions is a common feature in patient-specific computational fluid dynamics models. It was shown that PINN could use sparse velocity measurements away from the wall to quantify WSS with very high accuracy even without full knowledge of the boundary conditions. Examples in idealized stenosis and aneurysm models were considered demonstrating how partial knowledge about the flow physics could be combined with partial measurements to obtain accurate near-wall blood flow data. The proposed hybrid data-driven and physics-based deep learning framework has high potential in transforming high-fidelity near-wall hemodynamics modeling in cardiovascular disease.",0,1,1
"Force Generation by Parallel Combinations of Fiber-Reinforced Fluid-Driven Actuators
The compliant structure of soft robotic systems enables a variety of novel capabilities in comparison to traditional rigid-bodied robots. A subclass of soft fluid-driven actuators known as fiber-reinforced elastomeric enclosures (FREEs) is particularly well suited as actuators for these types of systems. FREEs are inherently soft and can impart spatial forces without imposing a rigid structure. Furthermore, they can be configured to produce a large variety of force and moment combinations. In this letter, we explore the potential of combining multiple differently configured FREEs in parallel to achieve fully controllable multidimensional soft actuation. To this end, we propose a novel methodology to represent and calculate the generalized forces generated by soft actuators as a function of their internal pressure. This methodology relies on the notion of a state dependent fluid Jacobian that yields a linear expression for force. We employ this concept to construct the set of all possible forces that can be generated by a soft system in a given state. This force zonotope can be used to inform the design and control of parallel combinations of soft actuators. The approach is verified experimentally with the parallel combination of three carefully designed actuators constrained to a 2DOF test platform. The force predictions matched measured values with a root-mean-square error of less than 1.5 N force and  $\mathbf {8 \times 10^{-3}}$ Nm moment, demonstrating the utility of the presented methodology.",0,1,1

The fabrication cost of a design is estimated by assigning a unit cost to each truss element, meant to approximate the cost of element placement and associated connections. A regularized Heaviside step function is utilized to estimate the number of elements existing in the design domain. This makes the cost function smooth and differentiable, thus enabling the application of gradient-based optimization schemes. We demonstrate the proposed method with classic examples in structural engineering and in the design of a material lattice, illustrating the effect of the fabrication unit cost on the optimal topologies. We also show that the proposed method can be efficiently used to impose an upper bound on the allowed number of elements in the optimal design of a truss system. Importantly, compared to traditional approaches in structural topology optimization, the proposed algorithm reduces the computational time and reduces the dependency on the threshold used for element removal.",0,1,1
"Compact low cost 5G NR n78 band pass filter with silicon IPD technology
A low cost and compact 1608 size Silicon integrated passive device (IPD) band pass filter design for the new 5G New Radio (NR) n78 band is discussed in this paper. Top coupled filter topology with transmission zeroes is selected to give low insertion loss (IL) < 1.8 dB in passband 3.3 ∼ 3.8 GHz, with >30dB attenuation at 2.7 GHz and 4.9 GHz.

"A Broader View on Bias in Automated Decision-Making: Reflecting on Epistemology and Dynamics
Machine learning (ML) is increasingly deployed in real world contexts, supplying actionable insights and forming the basis of automated decision-making systems. While issues resulting from biases pre-existing in training data have been at the center of the fairness debate, these systems are also affected by technical and emergent biases, which often arise as context-specific artifacts of implementation. This position paper interprets technical bias as an epistemological problem and emergent bias as a dynamical feedback phenomenon. In order to stimulate debate on how to change machine learning practice to effectively address these issues, we explore this broader view on bias, stress the need to reflect on epistemology, and point to value-sensitive design methodologies to revisit the design and implementation process of automated decision-making systems.",0,1,0
"Computational analysis of interface evolution and droplet pinch-off mechanism in two-phase liquid flow through T-junction microfluidic system
This work has explored interface evolution and pinch-off mechanism of the droplet formation in two-phase flow through cross-flow microfluidic device. The two-dimensional mathematical model equations have been solved using the finite element method under the squeezing regime (Cac < 10−2) for wide range of flow rates (0.1 ≤ Qr ≤ 10) and fixed contact angle (θ = 135o). The droplet formation process has been classified into various instantaneous stages as initial, filling, squeezing, pinch-off and stable droplet through microscopic visualization of interface evolution in phase profiles. The dynamics of interface, and point pressure in both phases is further gained and discussed. Maximum pressure in the continuous phase varied linearly with Qr. The droplet pinch-off mechanism has been thoroughly elucidated by determining the local radius of the curvature (Rc,min) and neck width (2r) during the squeezing and pinch-off stages. At the pinch-off point, both Rc,min and 2r are non-linearly related to Qr. Further, the topological dynamics of interface has been explored by analyzing the Laplace pressure (pL), acting on the interface curvature, evaluated using (a) pressure sensors in both phases, pL = pdp − pcp, (b) local radius of curvature pL = σ (1/Rf + 1/Rr), and (c) minimum radius of curvature, pL = σ ( 1/Rc,min ) .

"Reconfigurable Intelligent Surfaces based Cognitive Radio Networks
Over the last decade, cognitive radios (CRs) have emerged as a technology for improving spectrum efficiency through dynamic spectrum access techniques. More recently, as research interest is shifting beyond 5G communications, new technologies such as reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RISs) have emerged as enablers of smart radio environments, to further improve signal coverage and spectrum management capabilities. Based on the promise of CRs and RISs, this paper seeks to investigate the concept of adopting both concepts within a network as a means of maximizing the potential benefits available. The paper considers two separate models of RIS-based networks and analyzes several performance metrics associated with the CR secondary user. Monte Carlo simulations are presented to validate the derived expressions. The results indicate the effects of key parameters of the system and the clear improvement of the CR network, in the presence of a RIS-enhanced primary network.",0,0,0
"Sampling-Based Robot Motion Planning: A Review
Motion planning is a fundamental research area in robotics. Sampling-based methods offer an efficient solution for what is otherwise a rather challenging dilemma of path planning. Consequently, these methods have been extended further away from basic robot planning into further difficult scenarios and diverse applications. A comprehensive survey of the growing body of work in sampling-based planning is given here. Simulations are executed to evaluate some of the proposed planners and highlight some of the implementation details that are often left unspecified. An emphasis is placed on contemporary research directions in this field. We address planners that tackle current issues in robotics. For instance, real-life kinodynamic planning, optimal planning, replanning in dynamic environments, and planning under uncertainty are discussed. The aim of this paper is to survey the state of the art in motion planning and to assess selected planners, examine implementation details and above all shed a light on the current challenges in motion planning and the promising approaches that will potentially overcome those problems.",0,1,1
"Probing local nonlinear viscoelastic properties in soft materials
Abstract Minimally invasive experimental methods that can measure local rate dependent mechanical properties are essential in understanding the behaviour of soft and biological materials in a wide range of applications. Needle based measurement techniques such as Cavitation Rheology (Zimberlin et al., 2007) and Volume Controlled Cavity Expansion (VCCE, Raayai-Ardakani et al. (2019a)), allow for minimally invasive local mechanical testing, but have been limited to measuring the elastic material properties. Here, we propose several enhancements to the VCCE technique to adapt it for characterization of viscoelastic response at low to medium stretch rates (10 − 2 –1 s − 1 ). Through a carefully designed loading protocol, the proposed technique performs several cycles of expansion-relaxation at controlled stretch rates in a cavity expansion setting and then employs a large deformation viscoelastic model to capture the measured material response. Application of the technique to soft PDMS rubber reveals significant rate dependent material response with high precision and repeatability, while isolating equilibrated states that are used to directly infer the quasistatic elastic modulus. The technique is further established by demonstrating its ability to capture changes in the rate dependent material response of a tuneable PDMS system. The measured viscoelastic properties of soft PDMS samples are used to explain earlier reports of rate insensitive material response by needle based methods: it is demonstrated that the conventional use of constant volumetric rate cavity expansion can induce high stretch rates that lead to viscoelastic stiffening and an illusion of rate insensitive material response. We thus conclude with a cautionary note on possible overestimation of the quasistatic elastic modulus in previous studies and suggest that the stretch rate controlled expansion protocol, proposed in this work, is essential for accurate estimation of both quasistatic and dynamic material parameters.",0,0,1
"An approach for the identification of production process variables in cross-process chain production processes like battery cell production
Europe is currently not competitive in battery cell production. In order to increase competitiveness, battery cell production must be made more efficient. A major factor in improving efficiency is the reduction of waste. This requires understanding the many dependencies between the production process variables within battery cell manufacturing. For clarifying these dependencies, knowledge of the variables is essential. The challenge here is to completely determine them. For this purpose, different tools and methods are applied. But, in the case of cross-process chain production processes like battery cell production, they quickly reach their limits because these tools are not suitable for the structure and properties of the respective processes. The aim of the approach presented here is to support a complete identification of all process variables of battery cell production in the best possible way.",0,1,0
"Incentive Mechanism Design for ROI-constrained Auto-bidding
Auto-bidding plays an important role in online advertising and has become a crucial tool for advertisers and advertising platforms to meet their performance objectives and optimize the efficiency of ad delivery. Advertisers employing auto-bidding only need to express high-level goals and constraints, and leave the bid optimization problem to the advertising platforms. As auto-bidding has obviously changed the bidding language and the way advertisers participate in the ad auction, fundamental investigation into mechanism design for auto-bidding environment should be made to study the interaction of auto-bidding with advertisers. In this paper, we formulate the general problem of incentive mechanism design for ROI-constrained auto-bidding, and carry out analysis of strategy-proof requirements for the revenue-maximizing and profit-maximizing advertisers. In addition, we provide a mechanism framework and a practical solution to guarantee the incentive property for different types of advertisers.",0,1,0
"Knowledge Graphs in Manufacturing and Production: A Systematic Literature Review
Knowledge graphs in manufacturing and production aim to make production lines more efficient and flexible with higher quality output. This makes knowledge graphs attractive for companies to reach Industry 4.0 goals. However, existing research in the field is quite preliminary, and more research effort on analyzing how knowledge graphs can be applied in the field of manufacturing and production is needed. Therefore, we have conducted a systematic literature review as an attempt to characterize the state-of-the-art in this field, i.e., by identifying existing research and by identifying gaps and opportunities for further research. We have focused on finding the primary studies in the existing literature, which were classified and analyzed according to four criteria: bibliometric key facts, research type facets, knowledge graph characteristics, and application scenarios. Besides, an evaluation of the primary studies has also been carried out to gain deeper insights in terms of methodology, empirical evidence, and relevance. As a result, we can offer a complete picture of the domain, which includes such interesting aspects as the fact that knowledge fusion is currently the main use case for knowledge graphs, that empirical research and industrial application are still missing to a large extent, that graph embeddings are not fully exploited, and that technical literature is fast-growing but still seems to be far from its peak.",0,1,0
"Modeling and Control for Cooling Management of Data Centers With Hot Aisle Containment
In traditional raised-floor data center design with hot aisle and cold aisle separation, the cooling efficiency suffers from recirculation resulting from the mixing of cool air from the Computer Room Air Conditioning (CRAC) units and the hot exhaust air exiting from the back of the server racks. To minimize recirculation and hence increase cooling efficiency, hot aisle containment has been employed in an increasing number of data centers. Based on the underlying heat transfer principles, we present in this paper a dynamic model for cooling management in both open and contained environment, and propose decentralized model predictive controllers (MPC) for control of the CRAC units. One approach to partition a data center into overlapping CRAC zones of influence is discussed. Within each zone, the CRAC unit blower speed and supply air temperature are adjusted by a MPC controller to regulate the rack inlet temperatures, while minimizing the cooling power consumption. The proposed decentralized cooling control approach is validated in a production data center with hot aisles contained by plastic strips. Experimental results demonstrate both its stability and ability to reject various disturbances.Copyright © 2011 by ASME",0,1,1

"A time-fractional dual-phase-lag framework to investigate transistors with TMTC channels (TiS3, In4Se3) and size-dependent properties
In this study, a time fractional dual-phase-lag model with temperature jump boundary condition as a choice for the Fourier’s law replacement in thermal modeling of transistors, is utilized. In more details, the numerical simulation of heat transfer in newly proposed TMTC field effect transistors using fractional DPL equation has been investigated. Moreover, the Caputo fractional derivative is employed to formulate the finite difference scheme for discretization of the fractional DPL model. In order to obtain more precise results for the peak temperature rise, the temperature and heat flux profiles, the sizedependent thermal properties are taken into account. Also, the temperature jump boundary condition has been also applied by means of a mixed-type boundary condition. It is obtained that considering size-dependent thermal characteristics for transistors under study, results in an increase of the peak temperature rise. As an instance, considering the film dependent thermal properties for a 1-D silicone MOSFET with uniform heat generation at the upper part, makes the maximum temperature increase up to 250 percent. Furthermore, considering constant bulk thermal properties for the silicon MOSFET, certain oscillations are observed in the time-variation of the peak temperature rise for α= 0.7, 0.9 and 1. This presents the so-called negative bias temperature instability appearing in electronic nano-semiconductor devices.

"A Hybrid DC Fault Primary Protection Algorithm for Multi-Terminal HVdc Systems
Protection against dc faults is one of the main technical hurdles faced when operating converter-based HVdc systems. Protection becomes even more challenging for multi-terminal dc (MTdc) systems with more than two terminals/converter stations. In this paper, a hybrid primary fault detection algorithm for MTdc systems is proposed to detect a broad range of failures. Sensor measurements, i.e., line currents and dc reactor voltages measured at local terminals, are first processed by a top-level context clustering algorithm. For each cluster, the best fault detector is selected among a detector pool according to a rule resulting from a learning algorithm. The detector pool consists of several existing detection algorithms, each performing differently across fault scenarios. The proposed hybrid primary detection algorithm: i) offers superior performance compared to an individual detector through a data-driven approach; ii) detects all major fault types including pole-to-pole (P2P), pole-to-ground (P2G), and external dc faults; iii) identifies faults with various fault locations and impedances; iv) is more robust to noisy sensor measurements compared to existing methods; v) does not require exhaustive simulation and sampling for training the model. Performance and effectiveness of the proposed algorithm are evaluated and verified based on time-domain simulations in the PSCAD/EMTDC software environment. The results confirm satisfactory operation, accuracy, and detection speed of the proposed algorithm under various fault scenarios.",1,1,1
"Exploring Interactions Between Trust, Anthropomorphism, and Relationship Development in Voice Assistants
Modern conversational agents such as Alexa and Google Assistant represent significant progress in speech recognition, natural language processing, and speech synthesis. But as these agents have grown more realistic, concerns have been raised over how their social nature might unconsciously shape our interactions with them. Through a survey of 500 voice assistant users, we explore whether users' relationships with their voice assistants can be quantified using the same metrics as social, interpersonal relationships; as well as if this correlates with how much they trust their devices and the extent to which they anthropomorphise them. Using Knapp's staircase model of human relationships, we find that not only can human-device interactions be modelled in this way, but also that relationship development with voice assistants correlates with increased trust and anthropomorphism.",0,0,0

Our evaluation shows that visually estimated building condition can serve as a proxy for condition estimates by appraisers.",0,0,1
"INTERFERENCE AND FADE MITIGATION TECHNIQUES FOR KA AND Q/V BAND SATELLITE COMMUNICATION SYSTEMS
Up to the past few months, geostationary telecommunication satellite systems have kept taking advantage of the satellite natural wide area coverage capability, of their rather rapid deployment and efficient capability to provide a telecommunication infrastructure in areas where the terrestrial ones were deficient or did not exist. In a context where “broadband” was the major, if not the only driving factor for the development of telecommunication infrastructures, satellites have imposed themselves as natural carriers for broadcast services while remaining an alternative carrier for point-to-point oriented services. But the situation has changed, and the mid to long term perspectives for geostationary satellites are challenged by their capability to remain competitive, in terms of capacity versus cost and supported services, with regards to the evolution of existing terrestrial technology and the emergence of new ones. For the satellite to keep playing a major role as a carrier for broadcast/multicast services while offering a competitive complementary telecommunication means for the provision of point to point oriented services, it should offer wide capacity, good availability, high flexibility, and guarantee the required quality of service in a cost efficient way.",0,0,0
"Adaptive Kalman Filtering for INS/GPS
Abstract. After reviewing the two main approaches of adaptive Kalman filtering, namely, innovation-based adaptive estimation (IAE) and multiple-model-based adaptive estimation (MMAE), the detailed development of an innovation-based adaptive Kalman filter for an integrated inertial navigation system/global positioning system (INS/GPS) is given. The developed adaptive Kalman filter is based on the maximum likelihood criterion for the proper choice of the filter weight and hence the filter gain factors. Results from two kinematic field tests in which the INS/GPS was compared to highly precise reference data are presented. Results show that the adaptive Kalman filter outperforms the conventional Kalman filter by tuning either the system noise variance–covariance (V–C) matrix `Q' or the update measurement noise V–C matrix `R' or both of them.",0,0,1
"Design and stiffness analysis of a pitch-varying folded flexure hinge (PFFH)
Abstract Based on the theory and characteristics of the coil spring, we proposed a pitch-varying folded flexure hinge (PFFH), which is formed by a series of folded flexure units of variable pitches. With the increase of deformation, different pitch segments are contacted in order to achieve the purpose of variable stiffness. After giving an example design of the hinge structure, a theoretical calculation model of its equivalent spring constant is then derived accordingly. The hinge's stiffness characteristics are discussed and analyzed through both theoretical calculation and finite element analysis (FEA). The results showed that the stiffness of the hinge is varying, and the theoretical calculations results are well-matched with the results of FEA. In addition, the influence of different pitches on the stress and the trend of its stress changes are also analyzed.",0,0,1

"Analyst Forecast Bias, Investors’ Heterogeneous Beliefs and Stock Price Crash Risk
The existing literature has confirmed that analyst bias can exacerbate stock price crash risk, but it is not clear how analyst bias affects stock price crash risk. Considering the impact of information asymmetry and investors’ own differences, this paper argues that the increase of analyst forecast bias will improve investors’ heterogeneous beliefs; under the condition of short selling restriction, the improvement of investors’ heterogeneous beliefs will boost stock price to a higher level, thus exacerbating stock price crash risk. Therefore, the impact of analyst forecast bias on stock price crash risk is likely to be mediated by investors’ heterogeneous beliefs. To test this theoretical prediction, this paper selects China’s A-share listed companies from 2008 to 2019 as research samples, constructs a mediating effect model, and makes an empirical analysis to study the role of investors’ heterogeneous beliefs in the impact of analyst forecast bias on stock price crash risk. The results show that:（1）Analyst forecast bias has a positive impact on investors’ heterogeneous beliefs. The larger the analyst forecast bias in the previous period, the greater the investors’ heterogeneous beliefs in the current period.（2）Investors’ heterogeneous beliefs can significantly enhance stock price crash risk. The increase of investors’ heterogeneous beliefs will exacerbate stock price crash risk.（3）Analyst forecast bias will improve investors’ heterogeneous beliefs, and then exacerbate stock price crash risk. Investors’ heterogeneous beliefs play a partial mediating role in the impact of analyst forecast bias on stock price crash risk. This conclusion basically validates the above theoretical analysis.The contributions of this paper mainly include two aspects: First, it constructs a complete impact path and transmission mechanism. Although many scholars have studied the relationship between analyst bias and stock price crash risk, they have not further analyzed the detailed mechanism. They often put the investor behavior outside the research framework. In this paper, analysts, investors and stock prices of listed companies are included in the research framework at the same time. The impact path starts with analyst forecast bias, mediates investors’ heterogeneous beliefs, and ends with stock price crash risk. Second, it covers a number of market participants, and the research conclusion has important practical significance. Listed companies should strive to improve information transparency, decrease analyst bias, so as to reduce investors’ heterogeneous beliefs. It is one of the effective ways to avoid the stock price crash. At the same time, it also has important reference significance for securities industry practitioners, investors, regulatory authorities and the government to effectively realize and prevent stock price crash risk.",0,0,0

"Two Matrix-Type Projection Neural Networks for Matrix-Valued Optimization with Application to Image Restoration
In recent years, matrix-valued optimization algorithms have been studied to enhance the computational performance of vector-valued optimization algorithms.

"Electricity Tariff Design via Lens of Energy Justice
Distributed Energy Resources (DERs) can significantly affect the net social benefit in power systems, raising concerns pertaining to distributive justice, equity, and fairness. Electricity tariff and DERs share a symbiotic relationship whereby the design of the former directly impacts the economic efficiency and equity in the system. Current tariff design approaches suffer from opaque efficiency-equity trade-offs and are also agnostic of the externalities that affect both economic efficiency and equity. Therefore, this paper develops a justice-cognizant tariff design framework that improves the economic efficiency of tariff without sacrificing its distributional equity, and encompasses economic welfare, social costs of environmental and public health impacts, and socio-economic and demographic characteristics of electricity consumers. The proposed framework is based on a Single Leader Single Follower (SLSF) game incorporating a multi-objective optimization problem, and is evaluated on four different tariff structures. The SLSF game is reformulated as a Multi-Objective Problem with Equilibrium Constraints (MOPEC) and is solved by integrating the objective sum method for multi-objective optimization and Scholtes’s relaxation technique for equilibrium constraints. We compare the economic efficiency and equity of the proposed framework using the 11-zone New York ISO and 7-bus Manhattan power networks. The results demonstrate that spatiallyand temporally-granular tariffs ensure equity and economic efficiency at a lower energy burden to consumers. NOMENCLATURE A.

"Dynamic locomotion synchronization of bipedal robot and human operator via bilateral feedback teleoperation
A bilateral teleoperation system facilitates locomotion synchronization of a human operator and a small bipedal robot. Despite remarkable progress in artificial intelligence, autonomous humanoid robots are still far from matching human-level manipulation and locomotion proficiency in real applications. Proficient robots would be ideal first responders to dangerous scenarios such as natural or man-made disasters. When handling these situations, robots must be capable of navigating highly unstructured terrain and dexterously interacting with objects designed for human workers. To create humanoid machines with human-level motor skills, in this work, we use whole-body teleoperation to leverage human control intelligence to command the locomotion of a bipedal robot. The challenge of this strategy lies in properly mapping human body motion to the machine while simultaneously informing the operator how closely the robot is reproducing the movement. Therefore, we propose a solution for this bilateral feedback policy to control a bipedal robot to take steps, jump, and walk in synchrony with a human operator. Such dynamic synchronization was achieved by (i) scaling the core components of human locomotion data to robot proportions in real time and (ii) applying feedback forces to the operator that are proportional to the relative velocity between human and robot. Human motion was sped up to match a faster robot, or drag was generated to synchronize the operator with a slower robot. Here, we focused on the frontal plane dynamics and stabilized the robot in the sagittal plane using an external gantry. These results represent a fundamental solution to seamlessly combine human innate motor control proficiency with the physical endurance and strength of humanoid robots.",0,0,1

"Energy Regenerative Damping in Variable Impedance Actuators for Long-Term Robotic Deployment
Energy efficiency is a crucial issue towards long-term deployment of compliant robots in the real world. In the context of variable impedance actuators (VIAs), one of the main focuses has been on improving energy efficiency through reduction of energy consumption. However, the harvesting of dissipated energy in such systems remains under-explored. This study proposes a variable damping module design enabling energy regeneration in VIAs by exploiting the regenerative braking effect of dc motors. The proposed damping module uses four switches to combine regenerative and dynamic braking, in a hybrid approach that enables energy regeneration without a reduction in the range of damping achievable. A physical implementation on a simple VIA mechanism is presented in which the regenerative properties of the proposed module are characterized and compared against theoretical predictions. To investigate the role of variable regenerative damping in terms of energy efficiency of long-term operation, experiments are reported in which the VIA, equipped with the proposed damping module, performs sequential reaching to a series of stochastic targets. The results indicate that the combination of variable stiffness and variable regenerative damping results in a $\text{25}\%$ performance improvement on metrics incorporating reaching accuracy, settling time, energy consumption and regeneration over comparable schemes, where either stiffness or damping are fixed.",1,1,1

I propose a theoretical framework for understanding the role of affect in key aspects of entrepreneurship (e.g., opportunity recognition, resource acquisition).",0,0,0
"Under Frequency Load Shedding based on PMU Estimates of Frequency and ROCOF
The paper describes a local under-frequency load shedding and load restoration scheme, that exploits frequency and Rate-of-Change-of-Frequency (ROCOF) measurements produced by Phasor Measurement Units (PMUs) as detectors of a large contingency. The paper further discusses the appropriateness of using the synchrophasor model for estimating ROCOF during fast transients following a severe generation-load imbalance. The performance of the proposed relaying scheme is compared with a frequency-only based strategy, by means of a real-time digital simulator implementing the time-domain full- replica model of the IEEE 39 bus system.",0,0,1
"Accurate Tracking of Aggressive Quadrotor Trajectories Using Incremental Nonlinear Dynamic Inversion and Differential Flatness
In this paper, we propose a novel control law for accurate tracking of aggressive (i.e., high-speed and high-acceleration) quadcopter trajectories. The proposed method tracks position and yaw angle with their derivatives of up to fourth order, specifically, the position, velocity, acceleration, jerk, and snap along with the yaw angle, yaw rate and yaw acceleration. Two key aspects of the proposed method are the following. First, the controller exploits the differential flatness of the quadcopter dynamics to generate feedforward inputs for attitude rate and attitude acceleration in order to track the jerk and snap references. The tracking is enabled by direct control of body torque using closed-loop control of all four propeller speeds based on optical encoders attached to the motors. Second, the controller utilizes the incremental nonlinear dynamic inversion (INDI) method for accurate tracking of linear and angular accelerations despite external disturbances. Hence, no prior modeling of aerodynamic effects is required. We evaluate the proposed control law in experiments under motion capture. Using a 1-kg quadcopter, we are able to track a complex 3D trajectory, reaching speeds up to 8.2 m/s and accelerations up to 2g, while keeping the root-mean-square tracking error down to 4.0 cm, in a flight volume that is roughly 6.5 m long, 6.5 m wide, and 1.5 m tall.",1,1,1
"A Sport Tournament Scheduling by Genetic Algorithm with Swapping Method
A sport tournament problem is considered the Traveling Tournament Problem (TTP). One interesting type is the mirrored Traveling Tournament Problem (mTTP). The objective of the problem is to minimize either the total number of traveling or the total distances of traveling or both. This research aims to find an optimized solution of the mirrored Traveling Tournament Problem with minimum total number of traveling. The solutions consisting of traveling and scheduling tables are solved by using genetic algorithm (GA) with swapping method. The number of traveling of all teams from obtained solutions are close to the lower bound theory of number of traveling. Moreover, this algorithm generates better solutions than known results for most cases.",0,1,0
"Contract Lifecycle Management
Contract management depends on document-driven processes that, in a paper-based environment, can be laborious and inefficient. The time it takes to approve a contract can be as significant as the content preparation of the contract. Slow, manual contract processing reflects negatively on an organization's ability to provide excellent service. The contract lifecycle is defined differently from an organization to organization or even form department to another. The number of contracts and the associated documents are ramping up in this era of digital transformation. An automated, digital contract lifecycle management (CLM) can reduce the administrative burden on employees and allows legal, financial, sales, and other professionals to make better use of their expertise. This chapter shows how automation can change the organizations' behaviors to view contracts as opportunities for operational improvement and competitive advantage. It shows also how CLM can be integrated with business intelligence (BI) and data analytics systems to provide contract insights and dashboards.",0,1,0

"Explainable AI for B5G/6G: Technical Aspects, Use Cases, and Research Challenges
When 5G began its commercialisation journey around 2020, the discussion on the vision of 6G also surfaced. Researchers expect 6G to have higher bandwidth, coverage, reliability, energy efficiency, lower latency, and, more importantly, an integrated “human-centric” network system powered by artificial intelligence (AI). Such a 6G network will lead to an excessive number of automated decisions made every second. These decisions can range widely, from network resource allocation to collision avoidance for self-driving cars. However, the risk of losing control over decision-making may increase due to high-speed data-intensive AI decision-making beyond designers and users’ comprehension. The promising explainable AI (XAI) methods can mitigate such risks by enhancing the transparency of the black box AI decision-making process. This survey paper highlights the need for XAI towards the upcoming 6G age in every aspect, including 6G technologies (e.g., intelligent radio, zero-touch network management) and 6G use cases (e.g., industry 5.0). Moreover, we summarised the lessons learned from the recent attempts and outlined important research challenges in applying XAI for building 6G systems. This research aligns with goals 9, 11, 16, and 17 of the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (UN-SDG) , promoting innovation and building infrastructure, sustainable and inclusive human settlement, advancing justice and strong institutions, and fostering partnership at the global level.",0,0,0
"Neural Design Network: Graphic Layout Generation with Constraints
Graphic design is essential for visual communication with layouts being fundamental to composing attractive designs. Layout generation differs from pixel-level image synthesis and is unique in terms of the requirement of mutual relations among the desired components. We propose a method for design layout generation that can satisfy user-specified constraints. The proposed neural design network (NDN) consists of three modules. The first module predicts a graph with complete relations from a graph with user-specified relations. The second module generates a layout from the predicted graph. Finally, the third module fine-tunes the predicted layout. Quantitative and qualitative experiments demonstrate that the generated layouts are visually similar to real design layouts. We also construct real designs based on predicted layouts for a better understanding of the visual quality. Finally, we demonstrate a practical application on layout recommendation.",0,0,0

"Extended Kalman Filtering Applied to a Two-Axis Robotic Arm with Flexible Links
An industrial robot today uses measurements of its joint positions and models of its kinematics and dynamics to estimate and control its end-effector position. Substantially better end-effector position estimation and control performance would be obtainable if direct measurements of its end-effector position were also used. The subject of this paper is extended Kalman filtering for precise estimation of the position of the end-effector of a robot using, in addition to the usual measurements of the joint positions, direct measurements of the end-effector position. The estimation performances of extended Kalman filters are compared in applications to a planar two-axis robotic arm with very flexible links. The comparisons shed new light on the dependence of extended Kalman filter estimation performance on the quality of the model of the arm dynamics that the extended Kalman filter operates with.",0,1,1
"On the Risk of Quiet Vehicles to Pedestrians and Drivers
Technology has enabled the mass production of hybrid and electric vehicles. Interest in these alternative-energy vehicles has been heightened due to air quality concerns in urban areas. However, these vehicles are capable of very quiet operation, which could have negative side effects on pedestrian and driver safety because of the lack of sound cues. A survey of 380 people was conducted to explore interest and concerns about electrically powered vehicles. The data show that there is substantial positive interest in driving quiet hybrid and electric cars. However, in the role of pedestrian, participants expressed concern over the reduced auditory cues to the presence of a moving vehicle. Implications of quiet vehicles are discussed including the additional consideration of reduced driver awareness of their speed.

"A Review of Lithium-Ion Battery Models in Techno-economic Analyses of Power Systems
The penetration of the lithium-ion battery energy storage system (BESS) into the power system environment occurs at a colossal rate worldwide. This is mainly because it is considered as one of the major tools to decarbonize, digitalize, and democratize the electricity grid. The economic viability and technical reliability of projects with batteries require appropriate assessment because of high capital expenditures, deterioration in charging/discharging performance and uncertainty with regulatory policies. Most of the power system economic studies employ a simple power-energy representation coupled with an empirical description of degradation to model the lithium-ion battery. This approach to modelling may result in violations of the safe operation and misleading estimates of the economic benefits. Recently, the number of publications on technoeconomic analysis of BESS with more details on the lithium-ion battery performance has increased. The aim of this review paper is to explore these publications focused on the grid-scale BESS applications and to discuss the impacts of using more sophisticated modelling approaches. First, an overview of the three most popular battery models is given, followed by a review of the applications Email addresses: anton.vykhodtsev@ucalgary.ca (Anton V.

"Sustainable Green Management System (SGMS) – An integrated approach towards organisational sustainability
Abstract The current drive towards sustainability are putting pressure on organizations worldwide to implement procedures to manage the elements of sustainability for an organisation that include emissions, effluent discharge, waste disposal and energy efficiency. Even though these green elements can be managed, monitored and analysed in an integrated manner using some common resources and information, they are typically handled piecemeal under different types of management standards; and quite often, as ad-hoc projects as opposed to programs. This paper reviews the current management systems that relate to sustainability, and proposes the development an integrated green management framework called the Sustainable Green Management System (SGMS). A systematic, integrated and efficient approach for collecting, monitoring, analysing and managing information and resources via the SGMS will not only lead to organisational sustainability, but also have the potential to save ample resources, remove significant redundancies, promote cleaner production and enhance the profitability and efficiency of an organisation. An application of the proposed SGMS framework is demonstrated on a facility management case study that uses a unified GI as an indicator for an organizational sustainability.",0,0,0
"A capacitive touch controller robust to display noise for ultrathin touch screen displays
Capacitive touch screens have become widely adopted in mobile applications. Capacitive touch-screen display modules have conventionally been assembled by bonding two separate modules: 1) a touch-screen module with touch panel glass or film attached to the cover window, and 2) a display module, with a small air gap between them. An important role of the air gap is to decrease capacitive coupling of display noise to the sensors, and it is very effective since permittivity of air is more than 4χ lower than that of glass.",0,1,1
"Optimal Scheduling of Isolated Microgrids Using Automated Reinforcement Learning-Based Multi-Period Forecasting
In order to reduce the negative impact of the uncertainty of load and renewable energies outputs on microgrid operation, an optimal scheduling model is proposed for isolated microgrids by using automated reinforcement learning-based multi-period forecasting of renewable power generations and loads. Firstly, a prioritized experience replay automated reinforcement learning (PER-AutoRL) is designed to simplify the deployment of deep reinforcement learning (DRL)-based forecasting model in a customized manner, the single-step multi-period forecasting method based on PER-AutoRL is proposed for the first time to address the error accumulation issue suffered by existing multi-step forecasting methods, then the prediction values obtained by the proposed forecasting method are revised via the error distribution to improve the prediction accuracy; secondly, a scheduling model considering demand response is constructed to minimize the total microgrid operating costs, where the revised forecasting values are used as the dispatch basis, and a spinning reserve chance constraint is set according to the error distribution; finally, by transforming the original scheduling model into a readily solvable mixed integer linear programming via the sequence operation theory (SOT), the transformed model is solved by using CPLEX solver. The simulation results show that compared with the traditional scheduling model without forecasting, this approach manages to significantly reduce the system operating costs by improving the prediction accuracy.",0,0,1
"A Low-Cost and High-Gain 60-GHz Differential Phased Array Antenna in PCB Process
A broadband, low-cost, high-gain, multilayer differential antenna without air cavity is proposed for the 60-GHz phased array system. By using the standard low-cost printed circuit board process, a 60-GHz phased array antenna element and a 16-element phased array antenna prototype are implemented. To improve the bandwidth and antenna gain, a superstrate and a float rectangular ring are designed. The float ring can enhance the antenna vertical radiation, suppressing the antenna horizontal radiation and reducing the mutual coupling. Without any embedded air cavity, the proposed antenna is robust against the process variation, which is verified in the measurement. For the antenna element, the measured results demonstrate a peak gain of 8.9 dBi and a 10-dB return-loss bandwidth of more than 12 GHz, and the simulated radiation efficiency is above 90% at 60-GHz band. For the phased array antenna, two beam-fixed (0° and 30°) array antennas are tested to verify the beam scanning performance, which achieve gains of 16.3 and 13.6 dBi, respectively.",0,1,0

"A Broader View on Bias in Automated Decision-Making: Reflecting on Epistemology and Dynamics
Machine learning (ML) is increasingly deployed in real world contexts, supplying actionable insights and forming the basis of automated decision-making systems. While issues resulting from biases pre-existing in training data have been at the center of the fairness debate, these systems are also affected by technical and emergent biases, which often arise as context-specific artifacts of implementation. This position paper interprets technical bias as an epistemological problem and emergent bias as a dynamical feedback phenomenon. In order to stimulate debate on how to change machine learning practice to effectively address these issues, we explore this broader view on bias, stress the need to reflect on epistemology, and point to value-sensitive design methodologies to revisit the design and implementation process of automated decision-making systems.",0,1,0
"Broadband doa estimation using convolutional neural networks trained with noise signals
A convolution neural network (CNN) based classification method for broadband DOA estimation is proposed, where the phase component of the short-time Fourier transform coefficients of the received microphone signals are directly fed into the CNN and the features required for DOA estimation are learned during training. Since only the phase component of the input is used, the CNN can be trained with synthesized noise signals, thereby making the preparation of the training data set easier compared to using speech signals. Through experimental evaluation, the ability of the proposed noise trained CNN framework to generalize to speech sources is demonstrated. In addition, the robustness of the system to noise, small perturbations in microphone positions, as well as its ability to adapt to different acoustic conditions is investigated using experiments with simulated and real data.",0,1,1

"Building a biofoundry.
A biofoundry provides automation and analytics infrastructure to support the engineering of biological systems. It allows scientists to perform synthetic biology and aligned experimentation on a high-throughput scale, massively increasing the solution space that can be examined for any given problem or question. However, establishing a biofoundry is a challenging undertaking, with numerous technical and operational considerations that must be addressed. Using collated learnings, here we outline several considerations that should be addressed prior to and during establishment. These include drivers for establishment, institutional models, funding and revenue models, personnel, hardware and software, data management, interoperability, client engagement and biosecurity issues. The high cost of establishment and operation means that developing a long-term business model for biofoundry sustainability in the context of funding frameworks, actual and potential client base, and costing structure is critical. Moreover, since biofoundries are leading a conceptual shift in experimental design for bioengineering, sustained outreach and engagement with the research community are needed to grow the client base. Recognition of the significant, long-term financial investment required and an understanding of the complexities of operationalization is critical for a sustainable biofoundry venture. To ensure state-of-the-art technology is integrated into planning, extensive engagement with existing facilities and community groups, such as the Global Biofoundries Alliance, is recommended.",0,0,1

"Artificial Neural Networks and Adaptive Neuro-fuzzy Models for Prediction of Remaining Useful Life
The U.S. water distribution system contains thousands of miles of pipes constructed from different materials, and of various sizes, and age. These pipes suffer from physical, environmental, structural and operational stresses, causing deterioration which eventually leads to their failure. Pipe deterioration results in increased break rates, reduced hydraulic capacity, and detrimental impacts on water quality. Therefore, it is crucial to use accurate models to forecast deterioration rates along with estimating the remaining useful life of the pipes to implement essential interference plans in order to prevent catastrophic failures. This paper discusses a computational model that forecasts the RUL of water pipes by applying Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) as well as Adaptive Neural Fuzzy Inference System (ANFIS). These models are trained and tested acquired field data to identify the significant parameters that impact the prediction of RUL. It is concluded that, on average, with approximately 10\% of wall thickness loss in existing cast iron, ductile iron, asbestos-cement, and steel water pipes, the reduction of the remaining useful life is approximately 50%",0,0,1

"Public Drone: Attitude Towards Drone Capabilities in Various Contexts
Drone technologies represent a new category of mobile devices that are increasingly present in public spaces. They are becoming increasingly autonomous, featuring a wide range of capabilities from detecting objects to monitoring situations. Yet, little is known about the characteristics that influence their acceptability in public spaces. In this work, we investigate how people’s attitude towards drone capabilities is influenced by the context in which they are operating. We present three user studies: first, a participatory design study (N=5) in which we investigated people’s expectations towards drone capabilities and contexts of use; second, a pre-study (N=18) performed to select 6 contexts of use for public drones with three different severity levels; and third, a survey-based study (N=26) where we evaluated people’s attitude towards 10 drone capabilities in 6 contexts of varying severity levels. Our results demonstrate that people’s attitude towards drone capabilities is more positive for severe contexts. In addition, we found positive correlations for all capabilities between attitude and perceived severity of context. This work contributes to the design of context-sensitive human-drone interactions and to the future integration of public drones.",0,1,0
"Big Data in Real Estate? From Manual Appraisal to Automated Valuation
Real estate is the third-largest asset class for institutional investors, but determining the value of commercial real estate assets remains elusively hard. In this article, the authors provide a practical application of big data by employing a unique set of data on U.S. multifamily assets, in combination with sophisticated modeling techniques, to develop an automated, machine-based valuation model for the commercial real estate sector. The authors find strong evidence of the superiority of automated valuation models over traditional appraisals: The absolute error of the automated model is 9%, which compares favorably against the accuracy of traditional appraisals, and the model can produce an instant value at every moment in time at a very low cost. The authors also provide evidence of the importance of using hyperlocal information on the location of an asset. The model developed in this article is directly applicable for real estate lenders and investors and has important implications for the traditional appraisal industry.",0,1,0
"How emotions influence behavior in financial markets: a conceptual analysis and emotion-based account of buy-sell preferences
We develop a conceptual analysis and account of how emotions influence behavior in financial markets. To motivate our approach and to establish the need for such research, we first review the increasingly important literature on emotions in financial markets. While emotions influence investors in financial markets, there is a lack of precision concerning the exact nature of these influences. To remedy this, we identify and address a number of issues deriving from the current state of the finance literature. One issue concerns the lack of clarity in defining different emotion constructs. Another is the lack of a general emotion-based account of financial behavior. Our contribution is a classification of emotion-related phenomena and an emotion-based account of how anticipatory and anticipated emotions interact to determine investors’ buy and sell preferences in asset markets.

"OTA: Optimal Transport Assignment for Object Detection
Recent advances in label assignment in object detection mainly seek to independently define positive/negative training samples for each ground-truth (gt) object. In this paper, we innovatively revisit the label assignment from a global perspective and propose to formulate the assigning procedure as an Optimal Transport (OT) problem – a well-studied topic in Optimization Theory. Concretely, we define the unit transportation cost between each demander (anchor) and supplier (gt) pair as the weighted summation of their classification and regression losses. After formulation, finding the best assignment solution is converted to solve the optimal transport plan at minimal transportation costs, which can be solved via Sinkhorn-Knopp Iteration. On COCO, a single FCOS-ResNet-50 detector equipped with Optimal Transport Assignment (OTA) can reach 40.7% mAP under 1× scheduler, outperforming all other existing assigning methods. Extensive experiments conducted on COCO and CrowdHuman further validate the effectiveness of our proposed OTA, especially its superiority in crowd scenarios.

Case studies are used to compare MCS attacks with other network-based and electric-based attacks. The vulnerability of the MCS elements results higher than found for elements identified employing electrically extended measures.",0,0,1
"Material selection for MEMS devices
As MEMS design matures and migrates from process centric design to performance based design, MEMS designers would need a rational method for selecting an appropriate material that is not based on ease of processing alone. While there is a growing number of thin film materials that can be used in micromachining for MEMS devices, the selection of a particular material is rarely based on quantifiable criterion that relates directly to the optimum performance of the device. In this study, we present a methodology for creating material related device: performance indices that can be used for selecting best possible material for a device. This study is inspired by the Ashby approach and its extension to the microworld in recent studies, where materials are graded on material performance indices and the most appropriate material is selected from the Ashby charts so created. We extend this concept further in this paper and create device performance indices that can be used to grade MEMS materials in performance parameter space. We first create and discuss a material index for thermoelastic damping, an important index for vacuum packed dynamic MEMS devices that has been missing from the list of performance indices previously considered. We present two case studies of material selection, for a MEMS gyroscope and a MEMS ultrasound transducer, to illustrate the methodology and show two different approaches for creating optimality criterion in the presence of several competing performance indices.",0,0,1
"Why you should stop predicting customer churn and start using uplift models
Abstract Uplift modeling has received increasing interest in both the business analytics research community and the industry as an improved paradigm for predictive analytics for data-driven operational decision-making. The literature, however, does not provide conclusive empirical evidence that uplift modeling outperforms predictive modeling. Case studies that directly compare both approaches are lacking, and the performance of predictive models and uplift models as reported in various experimental studies cannot be compared indirectly since different evaluation measures are used to assess their performance. Therefore, in this paper, we introduce a novel evaluation metric called the maximum profit uplift (MPU) measure that allows assessing the performance in terms of the maximum potential profit that can be achieved by adopting an uplift model. This measure, developed for evaluating customer churn uplift models, extends the maximum profit measure for evaluating customer churn prediction models. While introducing the MPU measure, we describe the generally applicable liftup curve and liftup measure for evaluating uplift models as counterparts of the lift curve and lift measure that are broadly used to evaluate predictive models. These measures are subsequently applied to assess and compare the performance of customer churn prediction and uplift models in a case study that applies uplift modeling to customer retention in the financial industry. We observe that uplift models outperform predictive models and lead to improved profitability of retention campaigns.",0,1,0

"Repetitive motion of redundant robots planned by three kinds of recurrent neural networks and illustrated with a four-link planar manipulator's straight-line example
In this paper, a dual neural network, LVI (linear variational inequalities)-based primal-dual neural network and simplified LVI-based primal-dual neural network are presented for online repetitive motion planning (RMP) of redundant robot manipulators (with a four-link planar manipulator as an example). To do this, a drift-free criterion is exploited in the form of a quadratic performance index. In addition, the repetitive-motion-planning scheme could incorporate the joint physical limits such as joint limits and joint velocity limits simultaneously. Such a scheme is finally reformulated as a quadratic program (QP). As QP real-time solvers, the aforementioned three kinds of neural networks all have piecewise-linear dynamics and could globally exponentially converge to the optimal solution of strictly-convex quadratic-programs. Furthermore, the neural-network based RMP scheme is simulated based on a four-link planar robot manipulator. Computer-simulation results substantiate the theoretical analysis and also show the effective remedy of the joint angle drift problem of robot manipulators.",0,1,1

"Exoskeleton Knee Compliance Improves Gait Velocity and Stability in a Spinal Cord Injured User: A Case Report
Spinal cord injuries frequently impair the ability to walk. Powered lower limb exoskeletons offer a promising solution to restore walking ability. However, they are currently restricted to even ground. We hypothesized that compliant exoskeleton knees could decrease required effort to maneuver on uneven terrain, and increase gait velocity and stability. We describe a case study of a motor-complete spinal cord injury user (AIS A, Th12) walking with a powered exoskeleton on even and uneven ground over multiple sessions after extensive training. Measurements with compliant or rigid exoskeleton knee joints were performed on three different days for each configuration. Body motion and crutch ground interaction forces were recorded to assess gait performance. We observed higher walking speeds with a compliant exoskeleton knee configuration (mean: 0.116 m/s on uneven and 0.145 m/s on even ground) compared to a rigid configuration (mean: 0.083 m/s and 0.100 m/s). Crutch force impulse was significantly reduced in the compliant configuration. Lastly, gait was more symmetric when the knee joints were compliant. In conclusion, compliant exoskeleton knee joints can help maneuver uneven ground faster and with less user effort than rigid joints. Based on our findings, exoskeleton designers should consider introducing compliance into their design to increase gait robustness and performance, and render exoskeletons more suitable for daily life use.",0,0,1
"In‐line interference mitigation techniques for spectral coexistence of GEO and NGEO satellites
The interest towards the deployment of Low Earth Orbit (LEO)/Medium Earth Orbit (MEO) satellite systems in several frequency bands is increasing due to the requirement of low latency for real‐time systems and high demand of broadband data. When the number of usable Non‐Geostationary (NGEO) satellites, that is, LEO/MEO in space, increases, the frequency coexistence between the NGEO satellite systems with the already existing geostationary (GEO) satellite networks becomes a requisite. In this context, it is crucial to explore interference mitigation techniques between GEO and NGEO systems in order to allow their spectral coexistence. More specifically, in the coexistence scenario of GEO and NGEO satellite networks, in‐line interference may be a serious problem, especially in the equatorial region. In this paper, we provide several frequency sharing studies in the context of the coexistence of an NGEO satellite link with another NGEO/GEO satellite link. Furthermore, we carry out interference analysis between GEO and MEO satellite systems considering the case of the O3b satellite system and propose an adaptive power control technique for both the uplink and downlink scenarios in order to mitigate the in‐line interference. Moreover, we suggest several cognitive solutions for mitigating the in‐line interference and provide future research issues. Copyright © 2014 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.",0,0,0

"Alternative Dispute Resolution Process in the Tribunal for Consumer Claims of Malaysia: A Way Forward
The Tribunal for Consumer Claims of Malaysia (TCC) is a quasi-judicial body which provides alternative dispute resolutions to consumers which provides the consumers with alternative dispute resolutions mechanism in the form of negotiation and hearing. The objectives of this article are to review the negotiation process at the TCC; to analyze its weaknesses; and to suggest an alternative mechanism in lieu of negotiation, that is mediation. The finding of this research shows that the negotiation conducted at the TCC fails to settle most of the consumer claims. The writers have identified weaknesses associated with the negotiation process conducted at the TCC. Among the weaknesses are, the negotiation is conducted without the help or presence of a third party; the imbalance of bargaining power between the dealers/manufacturers/suppliers of services or goods; and the difficulty to reach a settlement by the parties. To overcome these weaknesses, the writers are proposing mediation as an alternative dispute settlement at the TCC.",0,1,0
"Measurement of arterial oxygen saturation (SpO2) using PPG optical sensor
The pulse oximeters are used to measure the heart rate and arterial oxygen saturation (SpO2). The photoplethysmographic (PPG) signals from pulse oximeters are highly influenced by the noise generated due to movement. The signal is also affected by the ambience light signal. It is essential to obtain a clean signal for the measurement of arterial oxygen saturation (SpO2). In this paper, an Adaptive Noise Cancelling (ANC) technique is being used to remove noise from the signal. A tri-axial based accelerometer data is also taken during the data acquisition time. Normalized Least Mean Square (NLMS) based adaptive filter algorithm is adopted. Tri-axis accelerometer data gives the directional data along the entire three axes. They are summed up and they are fed into the adaptive filter as reference noise signal. In the filter, the coefficients are updated based on the error signal and they are updated till the error becomes minimum. From the obtained clean signal oxygen saturation is calculated by finding the normalized ratio of ratios. Accelerometer based adaptive noise cancellation is found to reduce the errors in arterial oxygen saturation. The mean result for the mentioned algorithm is around 0.2409. The result is also found to be in correlation with the reference pulse oximeter.",0,0,1
"Commercial Vehicle Travel Time Estimation in Urban Networks using GPS Data from 1
1 Realistic travel time estimation for urban commercial vehicle movements is challenging due to 2 limited observed data, large number of Origin-Destination (OD) pairs, and high variability of 3 travel times due to congestion. Moreover most traditional data collection methods can only 4 provide information in an aggregated form which is not sufficient for micro-level analysis. On 5 the other hand, the usage of Global Positioning Systems (GPS) data for traffic monitoring and 6 planning has been continuously growing with significant technological advances in the last two 7 decades. 8 In this paper we provide a comprehensive review of the current usage of GPS data in 9 transportation planning applications and present a practical integrated methodology for using a 10 robust source of GPS data, for commercial vehicle travel time prediction. A comparison with 11 observed truck travel times collected from a limited source of truck-GPS data reveals that travel 12 times obtained from taxi-GPS data approximate those of trucks, and can be used to supplement 13 truck-GPS travel time data on a wider scale. While the amount of truck-GPS data is limited to a 14 small number of trucks serving very few OD pairs, taxi-GPS provide citywide penetration and 15 can estimate travel times between most OD pairs in a city. The provided methodology leads to 16 simple and effective travel time estimations using taxi-GPS data without a need for an extra data 17 collection effort. 18 TRB 2013 Annual Meeting Paper revised from original submittal.

Specifically, the aim of the research was to investigate the uses of yeah and mm as back‐channelling utterances to show engaged listenership. The research focused on the different back‐channel functions that can be identified and the loc ations at which they occur. Data was analysed from the Griffith Corpus of Spoken Australian English (GCSAusE) and some data collected by the researcher.

"Uplift Modeling : Predicting incremental gains
Marketing strategies directed to random customers often generate huge costs and a weak response. Sometime, such campaigns tend to unnecessarily annoy customers and make them less likely to react to any communication. Uplift Modelling has turned out to be very successful technique in understanding difference between the behaviour of a treated and a control population and this has been used as the basis for targeted direct marketing activity. Uplift modelling has wide applications in customer relationship management for up-sell, cross-sell and retention modelling. It has also been applied to political election and personalized medicine. We tried to approach this problem with 2 different perspective, predictive response modelling and uplift modelling. For predictive response modelling and uplift modelling, we used 4 models: Logistic Regression (with and without bagging), three layered neural network along with decision tree to apply on a real world example. Three layered neural network demonstrated significant advantages of uplift modeling over traditional, response based targeting.",0,1,0
"Piezoelectric Energy Harvesting: A Systematic Review of Reviews
In the last decade, an enormous amount of attention has been paid to piezoelectric harvesters due to their flexibility in design and the increasing need for small-scale energy generation. As a result, various energy review papers have been presented by many researchers to cover different aspects of piezoelectric-based energy harvesting, including piezo-materials, modeling approaches, and design points for various applications. Most of these papers have tried to shed light on recent progress in related interdisciplinary fields, and to pave the road for future prospects in the development of these technologies. However, there are some missing parts, overlaps, and even some contradictions in these review papers. In the present review of these review articles, recommendations for future research directions suggested by the review papers have been systematically summed up under one umbrella. In the final section, topics for missing review papers, concluding remarks on outlooks and possible research topics, as well as potentially misleading strategies, have been presented.

"Species and Memory Enhanced Differential Evolution for Optimal Power Flow Under Double-Sided Uncertainties
Considering the uncertainty of power generations, in addition to the uncertainty of loads, is more and more important because of the increasing use of renewable energy sources. Most existing works on dynamic optimal power flow (DOPF) have only focused on either the uncertainty of loads (called demand-side uncertainty) or the uncertainty of power generations (called supply-side uncertainty). As far as we know, only a little work on the dynamic OPF problems considered both uncertainties simultaneously. It might be because the combination of variable uncertainties could lead to a huge problem size for existing methods. In this paper, inspired by the ideas in the field of evolutionary dynamic optimization (EDO), we attempt to deal with uncertain parameters from the perspective of tracking the moving optimum. A species and memory enhanced differential evolutionary algorithm (called SMDE) is specially designed to solve the DOPF with double-sided uncertainties. Specifically, in order to deal with the double-sided uncertainties, a modified memory strategy and an improved multi-population strategy were introduced, where the multi-population strategy includes two versions. The experimental results on the modified IEEE 57-bus and 118-bus systems show that the proposed algorithms perform much better than the comparison algorithms for most cases.",0,1,1
"High-Efficiency Thrust Vector Control Allocation
A generalized approach to the allocation of redundant thrust vector slew commands for multi-actuated launch vehicles is presented, where deflection constraints are expressed as omniaxial or elliptical deflection limits in gimbal axes. More importantly than in the aircraft control allocation problem, linear allocators (pseudoinverses) are preferred for large booster applications to facilitate accurate prediction of the control-structure interaction resulting from thrust vectoring effects. However, strictly linear transformations for the allocation of redundant controls cannot, in general, access all of the attainable moments for which there is a set of control effector positions that satisfies the constraints. In this paper, the control allocation efficiency of a certain class of linear allocators subject to multiple quadratic constraints is analyzed, and a novel single-pass control allocation scheme is proposed that augments the pseudoinverse near the boundary of the attainable set. The controls are deter...",0,1,1
"Algorithms for Piecewise Constant Signal Approximations
We consider the problem of finding optimal piece-wise constant approximations of one-dimensional signals. These approximations should consist of a specified number of segments (samples) and minimise the mean squared error to the original signal. We formalise this goal as a discrete nonconvex optimisation problem, for which we study two algorithms. First we reformulate a recent adaptive sampling method by Dar and Bruckstein in a compact and transparent way. This allows us to analyse its limitations when it comes to violations of its three key assumptions: signal smoothness, local linearity, and error balancing. As a remedy, we propose a direct optimisation approach which does not rely on any of these assumptions and employs a particle swarm optimisation algorithm. Our experiments show that for nonsmooth signals or low sample numbers, the direct optimisation approach offers substantial qualitative advantages over the Dar-Bruckstein method. As a more general contribution, we disprove the optimality of the principle of error balancing for optimising data in the $\ell^{2}$ norm.",0,1,0

A sport tournament problem is considered the Traveling Tournament Problem (TTP). One interesting type is the mirrored Traveling Tournament Problem (mTTP). The objective of the problem is to minimize either the total number of traveling or the total distances of traveling or both. This research aims to find an optimized solution of the mirrored Traveling Tournament Problem with minimum total number of traveling. The solutions consisting of traveling and scheduling tables are solved by using genetic algorithm (GA) with swapping method. The number of traveling of all teams from obtained solutions are close to the lower bound theory of number of traveling. Moreover, this algorithm generates better solutions than known results for most cases.",0,0,0
"Optimum synthesis of mechanisms for path generation using a new curvature based: deflection based objective
This paper proposed a new curvature based path description method for path generation of planar mechanism, in which the position vector of a point on coupler, which follows most closely a predefined path, is directly calculated as a function of coupler motion properties. In addition this curvature based method makes it possible to define an objective function independent of rotation and translation transformations. 
 
Therefore, in this method, initial position, orientation, and coupler point vector parameters are not the optimization variable. These five parameters could be calculated as a function of other design parameters and they are found when these optimal values are obtained. Reducing five parameters of the optimal variables leads to a smaller design space and so less computation time to find the optimal result. 
 
Application of the method is also shown and its computation time and accuracy are compared with the result reported in the literature. It is found that this method is superior as it converges faster without loosing any accuracy.",0,1,1
"Impact of transport electrification on critical metal sustainability with a focus on the heavy-duty segment
The majority of transport electrification studies, examining the demand and sustainability of critical metals, have focused on light-duty vehicles. Heavy-duty vehicles have often been excluded from the research scope due to their smaller vehicle stock and slower pace of electrification. This study fills this research gap by evaluating the lithium resource impacts from electrification of the heavy-duty segment at the global level. Our results show that a mass electrification of the heavy-duty segment on top of the light-duty segment would substantially increase the lithium demand and impose further strain on the global lithium supply. The significant impact is attributed to the large single-vehicle battery capacity required by heavy-duty vehicles and the expected battery replacement needed within the lifetime of heavy-duty vehicles. We suggest that the ambition of mass electrification in the heavy-duty segment should be treated with cautions for both policy makers and entrepreneurs. Resource impacts from the electrification of transport sector in terms of heavy-duty vehicles are understudied. Here the authors find that a mass deployment of plug-in electric vehicles in the heavy-duty segment at the global level can substantially increase the lithium demand.",0,0,1
"RISE controller tuning and system identification through machine learning for human lower limb rehabilitation via neuromuscular electrical stimulation
Neuromuscular electrical stimulation (NMES) has been eﬀectively applied in many rehabilitation treatments of individuals with spinal cord injury (SCI). In this context, we introduce a novel, robust, and intelligent control-based methodology to closed-loop NMES systems. Our approach utilizes a robust control law to guarantee system stability and machine learning tools to optimize both the controller parameters and system identiﬁcation. Regarding the latter, we introduce the use of past rehabilitation data to build more realistic data-driven identiﬁed models. Furthermore, we apply the proposed methodology for the rehabilitation of lower limbs using a control technique named the robust integral of the sign of the error (RISE), an oﬄine improved genetic algorithm optimizer, and neural network models. Although in the literature, the RISE controller presented good results on healthy subjects, without any ﬁne-tuning method, a trial and error approach would quickly lead to muscle fatigue for individuals with SCI. In this paper, for the ﬁrst time, the RISE controller is evaluated with two paraplegic subjects in one stimulation session and with seven healthy individuals in at least two and at most ﬁve sessions. The results showed that the proposed approach provided a better control performance than empirical tuning, which can avoid premature fatigue on NMES-based clinical procedures.",0,1,1
"The importance of conflict resolution techniques in autonomous agile teams
Today, software companies usually organize their work in teams. Social science research on team development has shown that for a team to reach a productive and autonomous stage, it has to be able to manage internal conflicts and disagreements efficiently. To better facilitate the team development process, we argue that software engineers needs additional training in negotiation skills and conflict resolution. In this position paper, we outline ideas for what aspects to consider in such training. As an example, we argue that a majority of the conflicts originate from team-level factors and that they, therefore, should be managed on the team-level instead of in relation to dyads.",0,1,0
"Qini-based uplift regression
Uplift models provide a solution to the problem of isolating the marketing effect of a campaign. For customer churn reduction, uplift models are used to identify the customers who are likely to respond positively to a retention activity only if targeted, and to avoid wasting resources on customers that are very likely to switch to another company. We introduce a Qini-based uplift regression model to analyze a large insurance company's retention marketing campaign. Our approach is based on logistic regression models. We show that a Qini-optimized uplift model acts as a regularizing factor for uplift, much as a penalized likelihood model does for regression. This results in interpretable parsimonious models with few relevant xplanatory variables. Our results show that performing Qini-based parameters estimation significantly improves the uplift models performance.",0,0,0
"Simultaneous contact and aerodynamic force estimation (s-CAFE) for aerial robots
In this article, we consider the problem of multirotor flying robots physically interacting with the environment under influence of wind. The results are the first algorithms for simultaneous online estimation of contact and aerodynamic wrenches acting on the robot based on real-world data, without the need for dedicated sensors. For this purpose, we investigated two model-based techniques for discriminating between aerodynamic and interaction forces. The first technique is based on aerodynamic and contact torque models, and uses the external force to estimate wind speed. Contacts are then detected based on the residual between estimated external torque and expected (modeled) aerodynamic torque. Upon detecting contact, wind speed is assumed to change very slowly. From the estimated interaction wrench, we are also able to determine the contact location. This is embedded into a particle filter framework to further improve contact location estimation. The second algorithm uses the propeller aerodynamic power and angular speed as measured by the speed controllers to obtain an estimate of the airspeed. An aerodynamics model is then used to determine the aerodynamic wrench. Both methods rely on accurate aerodynamics models. Therefore, we evaluate data-driven and physics-based models as well as offline system identification for flying robots. For obtaining ground-truth data, we performed autonomous flights in a 3D wind tunnel. Using this data, aerodynamic model selection, parameter identification, and discrimination between aerodynamic and contact forces could be performed. Finally, the developed methods could serve as useful estimators for interaction control schemes with simultaneous compensation of wind disturbances.",0,0,1

Regarding circular FMCW SAR signal processing, the movement during the transmission of a pulse is expected to be one of the major problems. The platform movement during the pulse leads to the emergence of range migration error.

It compensates for the temperature effect on mobility μ and threshold voltage VTH of MOSFETs and generates a reference current that is insensitive to temperature and supply voltage. Theoretical analyses and experimental results showed that the circuit generates a stable reference current of 100 nA.

"Inertia Pricing in Stochastic Electricity Markets
—Maintaining the stability of renewable-dominant power systems requires the procurement of virtual inertia services from non-synchronous resources (e.g., batteries, wind turbines) in addition to inertia traditionally provided by synchronous resources (e.g., thermal generators). However, the pricing of inertia provision has not been studied in a stochastic electricity market, where the uncertainty characteristics of renewable energy sources (RES) are considered. To ﬁll in this research gap, this paper formulates a chance-constrained stochastic unit commitment model with inertia requirements and computes equilibrium energy, reserve and inertia prices using convex duality. Numerical experiments on an illustrative system and a modiﬁed IEEE 118-bus system show the performance of the proposed pricing mechanism. By allowing new virtual inertia providers to contribute to system inertia requirements, the total operating cost reduces. Moreover, the proposed stochastic electricity market internalizes RES uncertainty, which yields additional cost reductions by co-optimizing energy, reserve and inertia procurement.",0,1,1
"Direction of arrival estimation using a multiple-input-multiple-output radar with applications to automobiles
The thesis at hand investigates the direction of arrival (DOA) estimation using a Multiple-InputMultiple-Output (MIMO) radar system. The application of MIMO radars in automobiles is studied. A MIMO radar consists of several transmitting (Tx) and receiving (Rx) antennas. We focus on a time division multiplexed (TDM) MIMO radar with colocated Tx and Rx antennas. The motivation is the use of a radar as a security system in automotive applications, e. g. to identify a dangerous situation and react automatically. Security systems must be very reliable. Hence, besides a good estimation of the distance and velocity, a high performance in DOA estimation is necessary. This is a demanding task, since only a small number of antennas is used and the radar is limited to a small geometrical size. Compared to the corresponding Single-Input-Multiple-Output (SIMO) radar, a MIMO radar with colocated antennas can achieve a higher accuracy in DOA estimation due to its larger virtual aperture. Therefore it is a promising technique for the use in automobiles. The obtained results of this thesis enable us to find optimal TDM schemes which yield a very high DOA accuracy for targets which are stationary as well as for targets which are moving relative to the radar system. The results are not confined to MIMO radars in automobiles, but can be used in other applications as well. In Chapter 2 we introduce the basics of radar systems, which are important for this thesis. First we present three different kinds of radars, the pulse Doppler radar, the frequency modulated continuous wave (FMCW) radar, and the chirp sequence radar. After that, the performance measures of a radar system, which are used in the following chapters, are introduced. For that purpose, the concept of parameter estimators are presented. Thereafter, the accuracy is defined and a definition for the resolution is given. Chapter 3 gives an overview on the two types of MIMO radars: The MIMO radar with widely separated antennas and the colocated MIMO radar. A survey on the research already done on MIMO radars is presented. Thereafter, the different multiplexing techniques are discussed, which can be used in a MIMO radar to separate the signals of the different Tx antennas. The last part of Chapter 3 focuses on the application of MIMO radars in automobiles. It shows why TDM MIMO radars are suitable for the use in automotive applications. In Chapter 4 we study the DOA estimation for stationary targets, i. e. the targets are not moving relative to the radar. We investigate SIMO and MIMO radars and compute the deterministic CramerRao Bound (CRB) of the DOA for both types of systems. With these results we can determine the maximal achievable DOA accuracy. We compare both CRBs and show under which conditions",0,1,0

"Epitaxially grown pyroelectric infrared sensor array for human body detection
Abstract A high performance pyroelectric infrared sensor array based on epitaxially grown Pt and La-modified PbTiO3 (PLT) thin films is fabricated by RF magnetron sputtering and micromachining technology. A single detector element forms a ferroelectric thin film capacitor epitaxially grown on a single crystal MgO substrate. The heat loss and the noise level are minimized by etching the substrate that leads to reduced thermal mass. Micromachining technology is used to support the fragile MgO substrate membrane by coating polyimide on top of the detector elements. The sensor array is mounted on a dip-type package sealed by a Silicon filter with anti-reflection coating to transmit 8–10 μm wavelength infrared radiation from a human body.

"An Electronically Tunable Delay Line With Continuous Control of Slope and Peak Delay
This article presents a continuously tunable dispersive delay line (DDL). The slope as well as peak value of delay can be controlled electronically. The basic unit consists of a stepped-impedance section and two variable resistors in the form of p-i-n diodes. The slope and peak delay are controlled by changing the bias current of the p-i-n diodes. A transmission line model is used for theoretical analysis. Design equations are derived. Three prototypes with variable delay profiles are fabricated to validate the proposed technique. In all the cases, good agreement is obtained among the predicted and measured results.

"A Quadratic Programming Approach to Manipulation in Real-Time Using Modular Robots
Motion planning in high-dimensional space is a challenging task. In order to perform dexterous manipulation in an unstructured environment, a robot with many degrees of freedom is usually necessary, which also complicates its motion planning problem. Real-time control brings about more difficulties in which robots have to maintain the stability while moving towards the target. Redundant systems are common in modular robots that consist of multiple modules and are able to transform into different configurations with respect to different needs. Different from robots with fixed geometry or configurations, the kinematics model of a modular robotic system can alter as the robot reconfigures itself, and developing a generic control and motion planning approach for such systems is difficult, especially when multiple motion goals are coupled. A new manipulation planning framework is developed in this paper. The problem is formulated as a sequential linearly constrained quadratic program (QP) that can be solved efficiently. Some constraints can be incorporated into this QP, including a novel way to approximate environment obstacles. This solution can be used directly for real-time applications or as an off-line planning tool, and it is validated and demonstrated on the CKBot and the SMORES-EP modular robot platforms.",0,0,1
"A Fractional-Order Normalized Bouc–Wen Model for Piezoelectric Hysteresis Nonlinearity
This article presents a new fractional-order normalized Bouc–Wen (BW) (FONBW) model to describe the asymmetric and rate-dependent hysteresis nonlinearity of piezoelectric actuators (PEAs). In view of the fact that the classical BW (CBW) model is only efficient for the symmetric and rate-independent hysteresis description, the FONBW model is devoted to characterizing the asymmetric and rate-dependent behaviors of the hysteresis in PEAs by adopting an $N$th-order polynomial input function and two fractional operators, respectively. Different from the traditional modified BW models, the proposed FONBW model also eliminates the redundancy of parameters in the CBW model via the normalization processing. By this way, the developed FONBW model has a relatively simple mathematic expression with fewer parameters to simultaneously characterize the asymmetric and rate-dependent hysteresis behaviors of PEAs. Model parameters are identified by the self-adaptive differential evolution algorithm. To validate the effectiveness of the proposed model, a series of model verification and inverse-multiplicative-structure-based feedforward control experiments are carried out on a PEA system. Results show that the proposed model is superior to the CBW model and traditional modified BW model in modeling accuracy and hysteresis compensation.",0,0,1
"5G New Radio Unlicensed: Challenges and Evaluation

"Multi-scale Aggregation of Phase Information for Complexity Reduction of CNN Based DOA Estimation
In a recent work on direction-of-arrival (DOA) estimation of multiple speakers with convolutional neural networks (CNNs), the phase component of short-time Fourier transform (STFT) coefficients of the microphone signal is given as input and small filters are used to learn the phase relations between neighboring microphones. Due to the chosen filter size, M -1 convolution layers are required to achieve the best performance for a microphone array with M microphones. For arrays with large number of microphones, this requirement leads to a high computational cost making the method practically infeasible. In this work, we propose to expand the receptive field of the filters to reduce the computational cost of our previously proposed method. To realize this expansion, we use systematic dilations of the filters in each of the convolution layers. Different systematic dilation strategies for a specific microphone array are explored. Experimental analysis of the different strategies, shows that an aggressive expansion strategy results in a considerable reduction in computational cost while a relatively gradual expansion of the receptive field exhibits the best DOA estimation performance along with reduction in the computational cost.",1,0,1

Literature on disaster detection and analysis of related multimedia content on the basis of the nature of the content can be categorized into three groups, namely (i) disaster detection in text; (ii) analysis of disaster-related visual content from social media; and (iii) disaster detection in satellite imagery. We extensively review different approaches proposed in these three domains. Furthermore, we also review benchmarking datasets available for the evaluation of disaster detection frameworks. Moreover, we provide a detailed discussion on the insights obtained from the literature review, and identify future trends and challenges, which will provide an important starting point for the researchers in the field.",0,1,0
"Muscle Fatigue Analysis Using OpenSim
In this research, attempts are made to conduct concrete muscle fatigue analysis of arbitrary motions on OpenSim, a digital human modeling platform. A plug-in is written on the base of a muscle fatigue model, which makes it possible to calculate the decline of force-output capability of each muscle along time. The plug-in is tested on a three-dimensional, 29 degree-of-freedom human model. Motion data is obtained by motion capturing during an arbitrary running at a speed of 3.96 m/s. Ten muscles are selected for concrete analysis. As a result, the force-output capability of these muscles reduced to 60–70% after 10 min running, on a general basis. Erector spinae, which loses 39.2% of its maximal capability, is found to be more fatigue-exposed than the others. The influence of subject attributes (fatigability) is evaluated and discussed.",0,0,1

"Target Wake Time: Scheduled Access in IEEE 802.11ax WLANs
The increasing interest in ubiquitous networking, and the tremendous popularity gained by IEEE 802.11 WLANs in recent years, is leading to very dense deployments where high levels of channel contention may prevent meeting the increasing user demands. To mitigate the negative effects of channel contention, the TWT mechanism included in the IEEE 802.11ax amendment can have a significant role, as it provides an extremely simple but effective mechanism to schedule transmissions in time. Moreover, in addition to reducing the contention between stations, the use of TWT may also contribute to taking full advantage of other novel mechanisms in the IEEE 802.11 universe, such as multiuser transmissions, multi-AP cooperation, spatial reuse and coexistence in high-density WLAN scenarios. Overall, we believe TWT may be a first step toward a practical collision-free and deterministic access in future WLANs.",0,0,0
"Modelling Thermo-Electro-Mechanical Effects in Orthotropic Cardiac Tissue
In this paper we introduce a new mathematical model for the active contraction of cardiac muscle, featuring different thermo-electric and nonlinear conductivity properties. The passive hyperelastic response of the tissue is described by an orthotropic exponential model, whereas the ionic activity dictates active contraction incorporated through the concept of orthotropic active strain. We use a fully incompressible formulation, and the generated strain modifies directly the conductivity mechanisms in the medium through the pull-back transformation. We also investigate the influence of thermo-electric effects in the onset of multiphysics emergent spatiotemporal dynamics, using nonlinear diffusion. It turns out that these ingredients have a key role in reproducing pathological chaotic dynamics such as ventricular fibrillation during inflammatory events, for instance. The specific structure of the governing equations suggests to cast the problem in mixed-primal form and we write it in terms of Kirchhoff stress, displacements, solid pressure, electric potential, activation generation, and ionic variables. We also propose a new mixed-primal finite element method for its numerical approximation, and we use it to explore the properties of the model and to assess the importance of coupling terms, by means of a few computational experiments in 3D.",0,0,1
"Identifying and responding to outlier demand in revenue management
Revenue management strongly relies on accurate forecasts. Thus, when extraordinary events cause outlier demand, revenue management systems need to recognise this and adapt both forecast and controls. State-of-the-art systems rely on analyst expertise to identify outlier demand both online (within the booking horizon) and offline (in hindsight). In light of the partial nature of revenue management data and censoring effects from inventory controls, so far, there exists little research on automating the detection of outlier demand. To remedy this, we propose a novel approach, which detects outliers using functional data analysis in combination with extrapolation via time-series forecasting. We evaluate the approach in a simulation framework, which generates outliers by manipulating the demand model. By evaluating the full feedback-driven system of forecast and optimisation, we generate insight on the asymmetric effects of positive and negative demand outliers in light of revenue management heuristics that do or do not account for customer choice. Furthermore, we quantify the value of both online and offline outlier detection. We show that identifying instances of outlier demand using our methodology, and adjusting the forecast in a timely fashion, substantially increases revenue compared to what is earned when ignoring outliers.",0,0,0
"A compact planar UWB MIMO diversity antenna with Hilbert fractal neutralization line for isolation improvement and dual band notch characteristics
In this communication a compact printed CPW-fed dual band-notched Ultra Wideband (UWB) Multiple Input Multiple Output (MIMO) antenna is exhibited. The UWB MIMO antenna consists of two planar identical monopole elements PPM1 and PPM2 respectively and a novel modified 2nd order Hilbert fractal shaped neutralization line (NL) is introduced along with a modified circular defect in the common ground plane. Modified Minkowski boundary fractal geometry is introduced on the top edges of the respective monopoles for reinforcing the isolation of the MIMO system. The fractal shaped neutralization line serves two purposes isolation improvement as well as band notching the Wi-Max band. Notch bands encompassing 3.3-3.8 GHz Wi-MAX and 3.7-4.2 GHz C-Band are acquired by the introduction of the Hilbert fractal neutralization line and etching rectangular slots on the ground structures. The antennas Ultra wide bandwidth ranges from 3.05 GHz to 13.5 GHz (VSWR ≤ 2). The radiator and ground plane of the antenna are realized with an overall size of 26.75 mm × 32.94 mm. It can be also observed that the spacing between the elements is astonishingly reduced to 0.52 mm which is least as per the knowledge of the authors in UWB MIMO antenna designs proposed in the existing literature. The agreement between the various simulation results advocates that the intended antenna can be a worthy candidate for various UWB communication systems. All the simulated results depict that the proposed UWB MIMO antenna is a promising candidate for portable UWB as well as UWB MIMO systems.",0,0,0

"Flow-Aware Platoon Formation of Connected Automated Vehicles
Connected Automated Vehicles (CAVs) bring promise of increasing traﬃc capacity and energy eﬃ- ciency by forming platoons with short headways on the road. However at low CAV penetration, the capacity gain will be small because the CAVs that randomly enter the road will be sparsely distributed, diminishing the probability of forming long platoons. Many researchers propose to solve this issue by platoon organization strategies, where the CAVs search for other CAVs on the road and change lanes if necessary to form longer platoons. However, the current literature does not analyze a potential risk of platoon organization in disrupting the ﬂow and reducing the capacity by inducing more lane changes. In this research, we use driving model of Cooperative Adaptive Cruise Control (CACC) vehicles and human-driven vehicles that are validated with ﬁeld experiments and ﬁnd that platoon or- ganization can indeed drop the capacity with more lane changes. But when the traﬃc demand is well below capacity, platoon organization forms longer CAV platoons without reducing the ﬂow. Based on this ﬁnding, we develop the Flow-Aware platoon organization strategy , where the CAVs perform platoon organization conditionally on the local traﬃc state, i.e., a low ﬂow and a high speed. We simulate the Flow-Aware platoon organization on a realistic freeway network and show that the CAVs successfully form longer platoons, while ensuring a maximal traﬃc ﬂow.",0,0,0
"A Systematic Review of Productivity Factors in Software Development
Analysing and improving productivity has been one of the main goals of software engineering research since its beginnings. A plethora of studies has been conducted on various factors that resulted in several models for analysis and prediction of productivity. However, productivity is still an issue in current software development and not all factors and their relationships are known. This paper reviews the large body of available literature in order to distill a list of the main factors influencing productivity investigated so far. The measure for importance here is the number of articles a factor is mentioned in.

"Continuous-Curvature Target Tree Algorithm for Path Planning in Complex Parking Environments
Rapidly-exploring random tree (RRT) has been applied for autonomous parking due to quickly solving highdimensional motion planning and easily reflecting constraints. However, planning time increases by the low probability of extending toward narrow parking spots without collisions. To reduce the planning time, the target tree algorithm was proposed, substituting a parking goal in RRT with a set (target tree) of backward parking paths. However, it consists of circular and straight paths, and an autonomous vehicle cannot park accurately because of curvature-discontinuity. Moreover, the planning time increases in complex environments; backward paths can be blocked by obstacles. Therefore, this paper introduces the continuous-curvature target tree algorithm for complex parking environments. First, a target tree includes clothoid paths to address such curvature-discontinuity. Second, to reduce the planning time further, a cost function is defined to construct a target tree that considers obstacles. Integrated with optimalvariant RRT and searching for the shortest path among the reached backward paths, the proposed algorithm obtains a nearoptimal path as the sampling time increases. Experiment results in real environments show that the vehicle more accurately parks, and continuous-curvature paths are obtained more quickly and with higher success rates than those acquired with other sampling-based algorithms.",0,1,0

An image based visual servo (IBVS) controller has been designed to perform the alignment task by using the visual features of the power port in image plane. Decoupled features have been selected which eliminate the need to use image jacobian during the control design. This not only reduces the computational cost but also removes the hassle of dealing with image jacobian singularities during the visual servo. The findings have been validated both by performing simulations and designing an experiment which uses an industrial manipulator.",0,1,1

"A Comprehensive Review on the NILM Algorithms for Energy Disaggregation
The housing structures have changed with urbanization and the growth due to the construction of highrise buildings all around the world requires end-use appliance energy conservation and management in real time. This shift also came along with smart-meters which enabled the estimation of appliancespecific power consumption from the building’s aggregate power consumption reading.

"Deep Reinforcement Learning for Tropical Air Free-Cooled Data Center Control
Air free-cooled data centers (DCs) have not existed in the tropical zone due to the unique challenges of year-round high ambient temperature and relative humidity (RH). The increasing availability of servers that can tolerate higher temperatures and RH due to the regulatory bodies’ prompts to raise DC temperature setpoints sheds light upon the feasibility of air free-cooled DCs in the tropics. However, due to the complex psychrometric dynamics, operating the air free-cooled DC in the tropics generally requires adaptive control of supply air condition to maintain the computing performance and reliability of the servers. This article studies the problem of controlling the supply air temperature and RH in a free-cooled tropical DC below certain thresholds. To achieve the goal, we formulate the control problem as Markov decision processes and apply deep reinforcement learning (DRL) to learn the control policy that minimizes the cooling energy while satisfying the requirements on the supply air temperature and RH. We also develop a constrained DRL solution for performance improvements. Extensive evaluation based on real data traces collected from an air free-cooled testbed and comparisons among the unconstrained and constrained DRL approaches as well as two other baseline approaches show the superior performance of our proposed solutions.",0,1,1

"Prediction of aerodynamic flow fields using convolutional neural networks
An approximation model based on convolutional neural networks (CNNs) is proposed for flow field predictions. The CNN is used to predict the velocity and pressure field in unseen flow conditions and geometries given the pixelated shape of the object. In particular, we consider Reynolds Averaged Navier–Stokes (RANS) flow solutions over airfoil shapes as training data. The CNN can automatically detect essential features with minimal human supervision and is shown to effectively estimate the velocity and pressure field orders of magnitude faster than the RANS solver, making it possible to study the impact of the airfoil shape and operating conditions on the aerodynamic forces and the flow field in near-real time. The use of specific convolution operations, parameter sharing, and gradient sharpening are shown to enhance the predictive capabilities of the CNN. We explore the network architecture and its effectiveness in predicting the flow field for different airfoil shapes, angles of attack, and Reynolds numbers.",0,1,1
"A wavelet-based dynamic mode decomposition for modeling mechanical systems from partial observations
Dynamic mode decomposition (DMD) has emerged as a popular data-driven modeling approach to identifying spatio-temporal coherent structures in dynamical systems, owing to its strong relation with the Koopman operator. For dynamical systems with external forcing, the identified model should not only be suitable for a specific forcing function but should generally approximate the input-output behavior of the underlying dynamics. A novel methodology for modeling those classes of dynamical systems is proposed in the present work, using wavelets in conjunction with the input-output dynamic mode decomposition (ioDMD). The wavelet-based dynamic mode decomposition (WDMD) builds on the ioDMD framework without the restrictive assumption of full state measurements. Our nonintrusive approach constructs numerical models directly from trajectories of the full model’s inputs and outputs, without requiring the full-model operators. These trajectories are generated by running a simulation of the full model or observing the original dynamical systems’ response to inputs in an experimental framework. Hence, the present methodology is applicable for dynamical systems whose internal state vector measurements are not available. Instead, data from only a few output locations are only accessible, as often the case in practice. The present methodology’s applicability is explained by modeling the input-output response of an Euler-Bernoulli finite element beam model. The WDMD provides a linear state-space representation of the dynamical system using the response measurements and the corresponding input forcing functions. The developed state-space model can then be used to simulate the beam’s response towards different types of forcing functions. The method is further validated on a real (experimental) data set using modal analysis on a simple free-free beam, demonstrating the efficacy of the proposed methodology as an appropriate candidate for modeling ∗Address all correspondence to this author †Affliated with Department of Mechanical Engineering, Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University ar X iv :2 11 0. 12 99 0v 1 [ ee ss .S P] 2 5 O ct 2 02 1 Wavelet-based DMD A Preprint practical dynamical systems despite having no access to internal state measurements and treating the full model as a black-box.",0,1,1
"A Maximum Independent Set Method for Scheduling Earth Observing Satellite Constellations
Operating Earth observing satellites requires efficient planning methods that coordinate activities of multiple spacecraft. The satellite task planning problem entails selecting actions that best satisfy mission objectives for autonomous execution. Task scheduling is often performed by human operators assisted by heuristic or rule-based planning tools. This approach does not efficiently scale to multiple assets as heuristics frequently fail to properly coordinate actions of multiple vehicles over long horizons. Additionally, the problem becomes more difficult to solve for large constellations as the complexity of the problem scales exponentially in the number of requested observations and linearly in the number of spacecraft. It is expected that new commercial optical and radar imaging constellations will require automated planning methods to meet stated responsiveness and throughput objectives. This paper introduces a new approach for solving the satellite scheduling problem by generating an infeasibility-based graph representation of the problem and finding a maximal independent set of vertices for the graph. The approach is tested on a scenarios of up to 10,000 requested imaging locations for the Skysat constellation of optical satellites as well as simulated constellations of up to 24 satellites. Performance is compared with contemporary graph-traversal and mixed-integer linear programming approaches. Empirical results demonstrate improvements in both the solution time along with the number of scheduled collections beyond baseline methods. For large problems, the maximum independent set approach is able find a feasible schedule with 8% more collections in 75% less time.",1,1,0

"Approximation error method for imaging the human head by electrical impedance tomography
This work considers electrical impedance tomography imaging of the human head, with the ultimate goal of locating and classifying a stroke in emergency care. One of the main difficulties in the envisioned application is that the electrode locations and the shape of the head are not precisely known, leading to significant imaging artifacts due to impedance tomography being sensitive to modeling errors. In this study, the natural variations in the geometry of the head and skull are modeled based on a library of head anatomies. The effect of these variations, as well as that of misplaced electrodes, on (absolute) impedance tomography measurements is in turn modeled by the approximation error method. This enables reliably reconstructing the conductivity perturbation caused by the stroke in an average head model, instead of the actual head, relative to its average conductivity levels. The functionality of a certain edge-preferring reconstruction algorithm for locating the stroke is demonstrated via numerical experiments based on simulated three-dimensional data.",0,1,1

"3-D Transonic Flow in a Compressor Cascade With Shock-Induced Corner Stall
An experimental and numerical study of the transonic flow through a linear compressor cascade with endwalls was conducted. The cascade with a low aspect ratio of 1.34 was tested at an inlet Mach number of 1.09 and a Reynolds number of 1.9 310 6 . Detailed flow visualizations on the surfaces and five-hole probe measurements inside the blading and in the wake region showed clearly a three-dimensional boundary layer separation on the blade surface and the sidewall, and a severe corner stall induced by a strong 3-D shock system at blade passage entrance. The experimental data have been used to validate and improve the 3-D Navier-Stokes code TRACE. Results showed an excellent resolution of the complex flow field. Surface pressure distributions on the entire blade surface and the endwalls, flow angle and total pressure contours within the blade passage and the wake are compared with the experimental results. An analysis of the secondary flow of this highly staggered cascade did not show the classical corner vortex. Instead, a severe flow deviation and partly reverse flow near the walls is seen. The flow solver helped to identify a weak ring vortex that originates from the passage sidewall. Surface oil flow pictures on the blade contour and the sidewall are in qualitatively good agreement to numerical surface streaklines. A considerable improvement of the numerical results could be achieved by a gradual grid refinement, especially in the corner region and by successive code development.@DOI: 10.1115/1.1460913#",0,0,1
"Uncertainty Measures in Neural Belief Tracking and the Effects on Dialogue Policy Performance
The ability to identify and resolve uncertainty is crucial for the robustness of a dialogue system. Indeed, this has been confirmed empirically on systems that utilise Bayesian approaches to dialogue belief tracking. However, such systems consider only confidence estimates and have difficulty scaling to more complex settings. Neural dialogue systems, on the other hand, rarely take uncertainties into account. They are therefore overconfident in their decisions and less robust. Moreover, the performance of the tracking task is often evaluated in isolation, without consideration of its effect on the downstream policy optimisation. We propose the use of different uncertainty measures in neural belief tracking. The effects of these measures on the downstream task of policy optimisation are evaluated by adding selected measures of uncertainty to the feature space of the policy and training policies through interaction with a user simulator. Both human and simulated user results show that incorporating these measures leads to improvements both of the performance and of the robustness of the downstream dialogue policy. This highlights the importance of developing neural dialogue belief trackers that take uncertainty into account.",0,1,0
"Transmit Beamspace DDMA Based Automotive MIMO Radar
The time division multiple access (TDMA) technique has been applied in automotive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) radar. However, it suffers from the transmit energy loss, and as a result the parameter estimation performance degradation when the number of transmit elements increases. To tackle these problems, a transmit beamspace (TB) Doppler division multiple access (DDMA) approach is proposed. First, a phase modulation matrix with empty Doppler spectrum is introduced. By exploiting the empty Doppler spectrum, a test function based on sequential detection is developed to mitigate the Doppler ambiguity in DDMA waveform. Then, a discrete Fourier transform (DFT)-based TB in slow-time is formed. The proposed method can achieve waveform diversity in Doppler domain and generate a TB in slow-time that concentrates the transmitted power in a fixed spatial region to improve the transmit energy distribution for automotive MIMO radar, which is favored by medium/long range radar (MRR/LRR) applications. As compared to the conventional TDMA technique, the proposed TB DDMA approach can fully exploit the transmission capabilities of all transmit elements to ensure that the emitted power is efficiently used and inherits easy implementation.Moreover, the proposed TB DDMA method avoids the trade-off between the active time for each transmit antenna element and the frame time due to Doppler ambiguity mitigation. Simulation results verify the effectiveness of the proposed TB DDMA approach for automotive MIMO radar.",0,0,0
"Data-driven predictive control with reduced computational effort and improved performance using segmented trajectories
A class of data-driven control methods has recently emerged based on Willems’ fundamental lemma. Such methods can ease the modelling burden in control design but can be sensitive to disturbances acting on the system under control. In this paper, we extend these methods to incorporate segmented prediction trajectories. The proposed segmentation enables longer prediction horizons to be used in the presence of unmeasured disturbance. Furthermore, a computation time reduction can be achieved through segmentation by exploiting the problem structure, with computation time scaling linearly with increasing horizon length. The performance characteristics are illustrated in a set-point tracking case study in which the segmented formulation enables more consistent performance over a wide range of prediction horizons. The computation time for the segmented formulation is approximately half that of an unsegmented formulation for a horizon of 100 samples. The method is then applied to a building energy management problem, using a detailed simulation environment, in which we seek to minimise the discomfort and energy of a 6-room apartment. With the segmented formulation, a 72% reduction in discomfort and 5% financial cost reduction is achieved, compared to an unsegmented formulation using a one-day-ahead prediction horizon.",0,1,1
"Revisiting the origin to bridge a gap between topology and topography optimisation of fluid flow problems
This paper revisits the origin of topology optimisation for fluid flow problems, namely the Poiseuillebased frictional resistance term used to parametrise regions of solid and fluid. The traditional model only works for true topology optimisation, where it is used to approximate solid regions as areas with very small channel height and, thus, very high frictional resistance. It will be shown that if the channel height is allowed to vary continuously and/or the minimum channel height is relatively large and/or meaning is attributed to intermediate design field values, then the predictions of the traditional model are wrong. To remedy this problem, this work introduces an augmentation of the mass conservation equation to allow for continuously varying channel heights. The proposed planar model accurately describes fully-developed flow between two plates of varying channel height. It allows for a significant reduction in the number of degrees-of-freedom, while generally ensuring a high accuracy for low-to-moderate Reynolds numbers in the laminar regime. The accuracy and limitations of both the traditional and proposed models are explored using in-depth parametric studies. The proposed model is used to optimise the height of the fluid channel between two parallel plates and, thus, the topography of the plates for a flow distribution problem. Lastly, it is observed that the proposed model actually produces better topological designs than This paper is dedicated to two pioneers of fluid flow topology optimisation: Joakim Petersson (1968-2002) and Allan Roulund Gersborg (1976-2020).

"Quartierstrom - Implementation of a real world prosumer centric local energy market in Walenstadt, Switzerland
Prosumers in many regions are facing reduced feed-in tariffs and currently have no possibility to influence the level of remuneration for the locally produced solar energy. Peer-to-peer communities may offer an alternative to the feed-in tariff model by enabling prosumers to directly sell their solar energy to local consumers (possibly at a rate that is beneficial for both consumer and prosumer). The Quartierstrom project investigates a transactional energy system that manages the exchange and remuneration of electricity between consumers, prosumers and the local electric grid provider in the absence of intermediaries. This whitepaper describes the prototypical real-world system being implemented in the town of Walenstadt, Switzerland, with 37 participating households. The community members of this pilot project pay a reduced tariff for grid usage if the electricity produced by a prosumer is sold to another community member, which is located on the same voltage or grid level downstream a substation1. Such a tariff structure incentivizes local balancing, i.e. locally produced energy can be consumed locally whenever possible to avoid costs from higher grid levels. The blockchain is a novel technology suitable to log the produced and consumed units of energy within a community, making it possible to implement market places. In those marketplaces, both prosumers and consumers can indicate a price at which they are willing to sell / buy locally produced solar energy without the intermediation of a utility. The key goals of this project are the assessment of A) the technical, economical and ecological feasibility of a blockchain-based community energy system regarding local utilization of solar energy, grid quality and energy efficiency and B) resulting dynamics regarding local market prices and user acceptance.",0,1,1

We propose a novel reliability model for composing energy service requests. The proposed model is based on consumers’ behavior and history of energy requests. The reliability model ensures the maximum incentives to providers. Incentives are used as a green solution to increase IoT users’ participation in a crowdsourced energy sharing environment. Additionally, adaptive and priority scheduling compositions are proposed to compose the most reliable energy requests while maximizing providers’ incentives.

"Credit price optimisation within retail banking
The willingness of a customer to pay for a product or service is mathematically captured by a price elasticity model. The model relates the responsiveness of customers to a change in the quoted price. In addition to overall price sensitivity, adverse selection could be observed whereby certain customer segments react differently towards price changes. In this paper the problem of determining optimal prices to quote prospective customers in credit retail is addressed such that the interest income to the lender will be maximised while taking price sensitivity and adverse selection into account. For this purpose a response model is suggested that overcomes non-concavity and unrealistic asymptotic behaviour which allows for a linearisation approach of the non-linear price optimisation problem. A two-stage linear stochastic programming formulation is suggested for the optimisation of prices while taking uncertainty in future price sensitivity into account. Empirical results are based on real data from a financial institution.",0,0,0
"MiniV2G: An Electric Vehicle Charging Emulator
The impact of global warming and the imperative to limit climate change have stimulated the need to develop new solutions based on renewable energy sources. One of the emerging trends in this endeavor are Electric Vehicles (EVs), which use electricity instead of traditional fossil fuels as a power source, relying on the Vehicle-to-Grid (V2G) paradigm. The novelty of such a paradigm requires careful analysis to avoid malicious attempts. An attacker can exploit several surfaces, such as the remote connection between the Distribution Grid and Charging Supply or the authentication system between the charging Supply Equipment and the Electric Vehicles. However, V2G architecture's high cost and complexity in implementation can restrain this field's research capability. In this paper, we approach this limitation by proposing MiniV2G, an open-source emulator to simulate Electric Vehicle Charging (EVC) built on top of Mininet and RiseV2G. MiniV2G is particularly suitable for security researchers to study and test real V2G charging scenarios. MiniV2G can reproduce with high fidelity a V2G architecture to easily simulate an EV charging process. Finally, we present a MiniV2G application and show how MiniV2G can be used to study V2G communication and develop attacks and countermeasures that can be applied to real systems. Since we believe our tool can help research in this field, we also made it freely available.",0,1,1
"Opportunity for improving fab effectiveness by predictive overall equipment effectiveness (POEE)
The evolution of intelligent fab automation raises the opportunity of improving fab effectiveness such as product yield and machine efficiency by predicting their possible losses and taking proper actions in advance. With the huge amount of real-time data being collected in modern fab, the conventional standards and indexes defined for the yield and the productivity shall be inevitably altered in accordance with more predictable functions. Starting from the calculation for the tool productivity, this paper proposes the Predictive Overall Equipment Effectiveness (POEE) to evaluate and monitor the forthcoming effectiveness of a single tool. The POEE is composed of two parts: i) the deterministic effectiveness such as the preventive maintenance, engineering experiments, and job scheduling and dispatching, and ii) the predictive effectiveness in terms of the extra production time due to the abnormal tool condition and undesired product quality. In the diagnostic perspective, POEE serves as a consolidated index to be inspected and controlled. When the POEE is low, the practitioner can intuitively identify the critical causes beforehand in the three fundamental dimensions: tool availability, tool performance, and product quality. Through scheduling optimization, tool availability will be increased. By looking into the tool performance and product quality, abnormal tool conditions which impact on the process efficiency and product yield can be addressed and resolved. By monitoring the POEE over a set of tools in the same group, the high priority jobs can be dispatched to the tools with high POEE to avoid the yield loss and the long cycle time due to unscheduled machine breakdown. A Chemical Vapor Deposition (CVD) tool is taken as the study vehicle to demonstrate the proposed method in this research.",0,0,0

In this paper, the performance of IEEE 802.11b and 802.11g wireless local area networks (WLANs) performance under barrage jamming is evaluated theoretically and using measurements. Single WLAN ad-hoc link performance is measured when receiver station is jammed. WLAN link vulnerability assessment is based on throughput and packet error rate (PER), which depends on different physical (PHY) layer characteristic. WLAN system is found to be more tolerant to narrow-band jamming than to wideband-band jamming. In 802.11b WLAN, processing gain increases the tolerance to jamming whereas coding and different modulations are used to improve the link performance in 802.11g WLAN. Measured link throughputs are far from theoretical values, especially when high data rate modes are used.",0,1,0
"Mechanisms and Attributes of Echo Chambers in Social Media
Echo chambers may exclude social media users from being exposed to other opinions, therefore, can cause rampant negative effects. Among abundant evidence are the 2016 and 2020 US presidential elections conspiracy theories and polarization, as well as the COVID-19 disinfodemic. To help better detect echo chambers and mitigate its negative effects, this paper explores the mechanisms and attributes of echo chambers in social media. In particular, we first illustrate four primary mechanisms related to three main factors: human psychology, social networks, and automatic systems. We then depict common attributes of echo chambers with a focus on the diffusion of misinformation, spreading of conspiracy theory, creation of social trends, political polarization, and emotional contagion of users. We illustrate each mechanism and attribute in a multi-perspective of sociology, psychology, and social computing with recent case studies. Our analysis suggest an emerging need to detect echo chambers and mitigate their negative effects.",0,1,0

"Design and Analysis of 8 T / 10 T SRAM cell using Charge Recycling Logic
Normally charge recycling (CR) logic is used to reduce power in SRAM memory cells.The read access time of 8T SRAM cell is slightly degraded in read “0’‘ operation. When the cell is in zero state, the bitline discharge along BT takes longer due to lower conductance of NMOS transistor.Two 4X4 SRAM macros have been implemented in a standard 180 nm CMOS process using the 8T and the 10T cells. Both macros have identical address decoders, data-line drivers and sense amplifier design. Extensive Read/Write operations have been simulated at 25,50,75 and 100° C to evaluate the performance of the proposed design. All the circuits simulations are designed with 250 MHz and 300 MHz operating frequency with supply voltage of 3.3 mV. It is apparent that at both operating frequencies, the proposed 10T SRAM design has significantly less read power consumption. This is because only one cell is turned on instead of all the cells in one row in the conventional design. The static and dynamic power also calculated for the two SRAM design with various temperature ranges. Keywords-SRAM cell ;8T/10T memory cell;CR logic;CMOS Technology",0,1,1

Simulation results show that the proposed controller has simpler structure than that of conventional robust controller, and the stability margin obtained indicates the robustness of the proposed controller.",0,1,1
"Review of wafer dicing techniques for via-middle process 3DI/TSV ultrathin silicon device wafers
Dicing of ultrathin (e.g. <; 75um thick) “via-middle” 3DI/TSV semiconductor wafers proves to be challenging because the process flow requires the dicing step to occur after wafer thinning and back side processing. This eliminates the possibility of using any type of “dice-before-grind” techniques. In addition, the presence of back side alignment marks, TSVs, or other features in the dicing street can add challenges for the dicing process. In this presentation, we will review different dicing processes used for 3DI/TSV via-middle products. Examples showing the optimization process for a 3DI/TSV memory device wafer product are provided.",0,0,1
"Biomechanical model of batoid (skates and rays) pectoral fins predicts the influence of skeletal structure on fin kinematics: implications for bio-inspired design
Growing interest in the development of bio-inspired autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) has motivated research in understanding the mechanisms behind the propulsion systems of marine animals. For example, the locomotive behavior of rays (Batoidea) by movement of the pectoral fins is of particular interest due to their superior performance characteristics over contemporary AUV propulsion systems. To better understand the mechanics of pectoral fin propulsion, this paper introduces a biomechanical model that simulates how batoid skeletal structures function to achieve the swimming locomotion observed in nature. Two rays were studied, Dasyatis sabina (Atlantic ray), and Rhinoptera bonasus (cownose ray). These species were selected because they exhibit very different swimming styles (undulation versus oscillation), but all use primarily their pectoral fins for propulsion (unlike electric rays or guitarfishes). Computerized tomography scans of each species were taken to image the underlying structure, which reveal a complex system of cartilaginous joints and linkages. Data collected from these images were used to quantify the complete skeletal morphometry of each batoid fin. Morphological differences were identified in the internal cartilage arrangement between each species including variations in the orientation of the skeletal elements, or radials, and the joint patterns between them, called the inter-radial joint pattern. These data were used as the primary input into the biomechanical model to couple a given ray skeletal structure with various swimming motions. A key output of the model is an estimation of the uniaxial strain that develops in the skeletal connective tissue in order for the structure to achieve motions observed during swimming. Tensile load tests of this connective tissue were conducted to further investigate the implications of the material strain predictions. The model also demonstrates that changes in the skeletal architecture (e.g., joint positioning) will effect fin deformation characteristics. Ultimately, the results of this study can be used to guide the design of optimally performing bio-inspired AUVs.",0,0,1

"Crowdfunding for Design Innovation: Prediction Model With Critical Factors
Online reward-based crowdfunding campaigns have emerged as an innovative approach for validating demands, discovering early adopters, and seeking learning and feedback in the design processes of innovative products. However, crowdfunding campaigns for innovative products are faced with a high degree of uncertainty and suffer meager rates of success to fulfill their values for design. To guide designers and innovators for crowdfunding campaigns, this article presents a data-driven methodology to build a prediction model with critical factors for crowdfunding success, based on public online crowdfunding campaign data. Specifically, the methodology filters 26 candidate factors in the real-win-worth framework and identifies the critical ones via stepwise regression to predict the amount of crowdfunding. We demonstrate the methods via deriving prediction models and identifying essential factors from three-dimensional printer and smartwatch campaign data on Kickstarter and Indiegogo. The critical factors can guide campaign developments, and the prediction model may evaluate crowdfunding potential of innovations in contexts, to increase the chance of crowdfunding success of innovative products.",0,0,0
"Role of skin friction drag during flow-induced reconfiguration of a flexible thin plate
Abstract We investigate drag reduction due to the flow-induced reconfiguration of a flexible thin plate in presence of skin friction drag at low Reynolds Number. The plate is subjected to a uniform free stream and is tethered at one end. We extend existing models in the literature to account for the skin friction drag. The total drag on the plate with respect to a rigid upright plate decreases due to flow-induced reconfiguration and further reconfiguration increases the total drag due to increase in skin friction drag. A critical value of Cauchy number ( C a ) exists at which the total drag on the plate with respect to a rigid upright plate is minimum at a given Reynolds number. The reconfigured shape of the plate for this condition is unique, beyond which the total drag increases on the plate even with reconfiguration. The ratio of the skin friction drag coefficient for a horizontal rigid plate and form drag coefficient for an upright rigid plate ( λ ) determines the critical Cauchy number ( C a c r ). We propose modification in the drag scaling with free stream velocity ( F x ∝ U n ) in presence of the skin friction drag. The following expressions of n are found for 0 . 01 ≤ R e ≤ 1 , n = 4 ∕ 5 + λ ∕ 5 for 1 ≤ C a C a c r and n = 1 + λ ∕ 5 for C a c r ≤ C a ≤ 300 , where R e is Reynolds number. We briefly discuss the combined effect of the skin friction drag and buoyancy on the drag reduction. An assessment of the feasibility of experiments is presented in order to translate the present model to physical systems.",0,0,1
"Speed Control of Load Torque Feedforward Compensation Based on Linear Active Disturbance Rejection for Five-Phase PMSM
This study focuses on the speed control problem of a five-phase permanent magnet synchronous motor (PMSM) in the presence of a variable load torque and unknown model parameters. To overcome the mutual transmission of motor torque ripple and load disturbance when the five-phase PMSM directly drives the load, a control method of load torque feedforward compensation based on linear auto disturbance rejection controller (LADRC) is proposed. First, the load torque observer is introduced to observe the load torque which is used as feedforward compensation to eliminate the effects of load torque changes. Second, an LADRC in the outer speed loop is presented to estimate the disturbance, and the stability of LADRC is analyzed. Third, the proposed torque feedforward method based on the LADRC is compared with the traditional proportional integral (PI) torque feedforward method. The PI regulators for current loops are designed. Finally, the simulation models are built and the control algorithms are both implemented using a TMS320F28335 DSP. The simulation and experiment results show that the proposed load torque feedforward compensation based on the LADRC produces excellent dynamic performance, such as smaller overshoot and faster response time. The proposed control scheme is robust and has a strong anti-disturbance ability, even in the case of large load torque disturbances.",0,1,1
"Blockchain-Based Charging Coordination Mechanism for Smart Grid Energy Storage Units
Energy storage units (ESUs) enable several attractive features of modern smart grids such as enhanced grid resilience, effective demand response, and reduced bills. However, uncoordinated charging of ESUs stresses the power system and can lead to a blackout. In this paper, we leverage the blockchain and smart contracts to build a decentralized charging coordination mechanism without the need for a centralized charging coordinator. First ESUs should use tokens for anonymously authenticate themselves to the blockchain. Then each ESU sends a charging request that contains its State-of-Charge (SoC), Time-to-complete-charge (TCC) and amount of required charging to the smart contract address on the blockchain. The smart contract will then run the charging coordination mechanism in a self-executed manner such that ESUs with the highest priorities are charged in the present time slot while charging requests of lower priority ESUs are deferred to future time slots. In this way, each ESU can make sure that charging schedules are computed correctly. Finally, we have implemented the proposed mechanism on the Ethereum test-bed blockchain, and our analysis shows that execution cost can be acceptable in terms of gas consumption while enabling decentralized charging coordination with increased transparency, reliability, and privacy preserving.",0,0,1
"A Lagrangian method for constrained dynamics in tensegrity systems with compressible bars
This paper presents a Lagrangian approach to simulating multibody dynamics in a tensegrity framework with an ability to tackle holonomic constraint violations in an energy-preserving scheme. Governing equations are described using non-minimum coordinates to simplify descriptions of the structure’s kinematics. To minimize constraint drift arising from this redundant system, the direct correction method has been employed in conjunction with a novel energy-correcting scheme that treats the total mechanical energy of the system as a supplementary constraint. The formulation has been extended to allow tensegrity structures with compressible bars, allowing for further discussion on potential choices for softer bar materials. The benchmark example involving a common tensegrity structure demonstrates the superiority of the presented formulation over Simscape Multibody in terms of motion accuracy as well as energy conservation. The effectiveness of the energy correction scheme is found to be increasing with the extent of deformations in the structure.",0,1,1

Finally, we discuss some of the challenges faced when building uplift models and suggest some key challenges for future research.",0,1,0
"Performance Analysis of Adaptive Neuro Fuzzy Inference System Control for MEMS Navigation System
Characterized by small volume, low cost, and low power, MEMS inertial sensors are widely concerned and applied in navigation research, environmental monitoring, military, and so on. Notably in indoor and pedestrian navigation, its easily portable feature seems particularly indispensable and important. However, MEMS inertial sensor has inborn low precision and is impressionable and sometimes goes against accurate navigation or even becomes seriously unstable when working for a period of time and the initial alignment and calibration are invalid. A thought of adaptive neuro fuzzy inference system (ANFIS) is relied on, and an assistive control modulated method is presented in this paper, which is newly designed to improve the inertial sensor performance by black box control and inference. The repeatability and long-time tendency of the MEMS sensors are tested and analyzed by ALLAN method. The parameters of ANFIS models are trained using reasonable fuzzy control strategy, with high-precision navigation system for reference as well as MEMS sensor property. The MEMS error nonlinearity is measured and modulated through the peculiarity of the fuzzy control convergence, to enhance the MEMS function and the whole MEMS system property. Performance of the proposed model has been experimentally verified using low-cost MEMS inertial sensors, and the MEMS output error is well compensated. The test results indicate that ANFIS system trained by high-precision navigation system can efficiently provide corrections to MEMS output and meet the requirement on navigation performance.",0,0,1

"Who Funds Misinformation? A Systematic Analysis of the Ad-related Profit Routines of Fake News sites
Fake news is an age-old phenomenon, widely assumed to be associated with political propaganda published to sway public opinion. Yet, with the growth of social media it has become a lucrative business for web publishers. Despite many studies performed and countermeasures deployed from researchers and stakeholders, unreliable news sites have increased their share of engagement among the top performing news sources in last years. Indeed, stifling fake news impact depends on the efforts from the society, and the market, in limiting the (economic) incentives of fake news producers. In this paper, we aim at enhancing the transparency around these exact incentives and explore the following main questions: Who supports the existence of fake news websites via paid ads, either as an advertiser or an ad seller? Who owns these websites and what other Web business are they into? What tracking activity do they perform in these websites? Aiming to answer these questions, we are the first to systematize the auditing process of fake news revenue flows. We develop a novel ad detection methodology to identify the companies that advertise in fake news websites and the intermediary companies responsible for facilitating those ad revenues. We study more than 2400 popular fake and real news websites and show that well-known legitimate ad networks, such as of Google, IndexExchange, and AppNexus, have a direct advertising relation with more than 40% of these fake news websites, and a re-seller advertising relation with more than 60% of them. Using a graph clustering approach on an extended set of 114.5K sites connected with 443K edges, we show that entities who own fake news websites, also own (or operate) other types of websites for entertainment, business, and politics, pointing to the fact that owning a fake news website is part of a broader business operation.",1,1,0
"Cyber Insurance Against Cyberattacks on Electric Vehicle Charging Stations
Cyberattacks in the energy sector are commonplace. Load-altering cyberattacks launched via the manipulations of high-wattage appliances and assets are particularly alarming, as they are not continuously monitored by electric power utilities. Public Electric Vehicle Charging Stations (EVCSs) are among such high-wattage assets. Even EVCSs monitored by the electric power utilities and protected by state-of-the-art defense mechanisms are vulnerable to cyberattacks. Such cyberattacks cause financial losses to the EVCSs. In this paper, we propose cyber insurance for EVCSs to hedge the economic loss due to such cyberattacks and develop a data-driven cyber insurance design model for public EVCSs. Under mild modeling assumptions, we derive an optimal cyber insurance premium. Then, we ensure the robustness of this optimal premium and investigate the risk of insuring the EVCSs using a suitable risk assessment metric (Conditional Value-at-Risk). A case study with data from EVCSs in Manhattan, New York illustrates our results. Our results demonstrate that risk assessment is crucial for designing insurance premiums. Furthermore, the premium increases in proportion to the loss coverage offered for the EVCSs. This work informs the stakeholders involved in the roll-out and operation of public EVCSs about the benefits of cyber insurance and suggests that insurance premiums can be reduced by deploying state-of-the-art defense mechanisms.",0,0,1
"What brand extensions need to fully benefit from their parental heritage
It is well established that consumer acceptance of a brand extension depends on how strongly it fits with its parental origins. Less appreciated is how this acceptance also depends on the mental association created in consumers’ minds between the extension and its parent brand. Our investigation considers the gateway role played by this association’s mental accessibility in allowing extensions to fully benefit from their parental heritage. Six studies examine the effect of reinstating an extension’s association with its parent brand on extension evaluations. When reinstatement enhances the parental association’s accessibility, it strengthens the parent brand’s influence, leading to more or less favorable extension evaluations contingent upon the extension’s fit with its parental origins. These reinstatement effects carry important implications for brand-extension managers and researchers.",0,1,0
"Development of a wearable haptic device that presents haptics sensation of the finger pad to the forearm
While many wearable tactile displays for the fingers, such as fingertip-type and glove-type displays, have been developed, their weight and size typically hinder the free movement of fingers, especially when considering the multi-finger scenario. We propose a method of presenting the haptics sensation of the fingertip on the forearm, not on the fingertip, to address this issue. A five-bar linkage mechanism was adopted to present a two-degree-of-freedom force. We conducted two experiments. In the first experiment, we presented a pressure sensation and a horizontal friction sensation perceived by the index finger to multiple sites of the forearm to search for a proper location of presentation, finding that the volar part of the wrist is optimal. On the basis of this result, we developed a device for the index finger and thumb, and conducted a second experiment to present the grasping force in a virtual reality environment. The realism of the experience in virtual reality was better when using the designed device than for no haptics cue or for vibration conditions.",0,0,1
"Complex cepstrum-based decomposition of speech for glottal source estimation
Homomorphic analysis is a well-known method for the separation of non-linearly combined signals. More particularly, the use of complex cepstrum for source-tract deconvolution has been discussed in various articles. However there exists no study which proposes a glottal flow estimation methodology based on cepstrum and reports effective results. In this paper, we show that complex cepstrum can be effectively used for glottal flow estimation by separating the causal and anticausal components of a windowed speech signal as done by the Zeros of the Z-Transform (ZZT) decomposition. Based on exactly the same principles presented for ZZT decomposition, windowing should be applied such that the windowed speech signals exhibit mixed-phase characteristics which conform the speech production model that the anticausal component is mainly due to the glottal flow open phase. The advantage of the complex cepstrum-based approach compared to the ZZT decomposition is its much higher speed. Index Terms: Speech Analysis, Homomorphic Processing, Glottal Source Estimation",0,0,1
"Design and Analysis of Modular Pipe Climber-III with a Multi-Output Differential Mechanism
This paper presents the design of an in-pipe climbing robot that operates using a novel ‘Three-output open differential’(3-OOD) mechanism to traverse complex networks of pipes. Conventional wheeled/tracked in-pipe climbing robots are prone to slip and drag while traversing in pipe bends. The 3-OOD mechanism helps in achieving the novel result of eliminating slip and drag in the robot tracks during motion. The proposed differential realizes the functional abilities of the traditional two-output differential, which is achieved the first time for a differential with three outputs. The 3-OOD mechanism mechanically modulates the track speeds of the robot based on the forces exerted on each track inside the pipe network, by eliminating the need for any active control. The simulation of the robot traversing in the pipe network in different orientations and in pipe-bends without slip shows the proposed design’s effectiveness.",0,1,1
"The Discourse of Online Content Moderation: Investigating Polarized User Responses to Changes in Reddit’s Quarantine Policy
Recent concerns over abusive behavior on their platforms have pressured social media companies to strengthen their content moderation policies. However, user opinions on these policies have been relatively understudied. In this paper, we present an analysis of user responses to a September 27, 2018 announcement about the quarantine policy on Reddit as a case study of to what extent the discourse on content moderation is polarized by users’ ideological viewpoint. We introduce a novel partitioning approach for characterizing user polarization based on their distribution of participation across interest subreddits. We then use automated techniques for capturing framing to examine how users with different viewpoints discuss moderation issues, finding that right-leaning users invoked censorship while left-leaning users highlighted inconsistencies on how content policies are applied. Overall, we argue for a more nuanced approach to moderation by highlighting the intersection of behavior and ideology in considering how abusive language is defined and regulated.",0,0,0
"National Center for Intermodal Transportation & Economic Development Effects of Safety Culture & Leadership on Accident Rates Among Transportation Workers NCITEC Project: 2012_22
Workplace accidents have a devastating effect on the transportation industry. Corporate safety culture has inspired interest because it is thought to influence the performance of employees. However, the implementation and measurement of safety culture interventions are challenged by a lack of theoretically supported measures. The purpose of this project is to discuss the design and validation of the Safety Culture Scale (SCS) and its utility in improving roadway safety through community involvement and assessment. The SCS was developed by creating consistent with the three themes (values, meaning, and behavioral expectations). The survey instrument was administered to a large sample of employees of a large public transportation agency (N=1909) participants were obtained. Confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) compared the fit of likely models. One-way between groups analysis of variance, and post hoc tests provided initial evidence of the validity and reliability of the SCS as a measure for the transportation industry in that the scale was able to significantly differentiate (p<.05) between persons who had been involved in more accidents and safety violations thus demonstrating the relationship between safety culture and accident rates.. Implications of these findings are that the safety culture survey could be used to assess safety awareness and safety culture of trucking or transport companies, small communities, and other organizations involved in transport. By carefully monitoring scores on the SCS efforts could be made in various communities and organizations to improve attitudes towards safety and ultimately to reduce accidents and improve road safety.

Whether one considers marketing as a managerial process or as a formalized field of inquiry, it is clear that it is interdisciplinary in nature, spanning a variety of academic fields, including the behavioural and social sciences, communications and economics.These disciplinary links serve to enrich the marketing enterprise, providing it with empirically-grounded theories and concepts that lie at the heart of the pluralistic perspective typically employed by marketers to ply their trade. The purpose of this chapter is to focus on the psychological foundations of marketing – a daunting task in light of the breadth of contributions of psychology to the marketing discipline, but one that nonetheless is essential to carry out in order to gain a fuller understanding of what marketing is and how the marketing process functions. Psychology’s contributions to marketing are perhaps most evident in the study of consumer behaviour, which serves as the focus of Chapter 12; however, a broader perspective reveals psychology’s relevance to each of marketing’s various activities, including product design, promotion, pricing, and the like.",0,0,0

"Title Measurements of POI-based mixed use and their relationshipswith neighbourhood vibrancy
Although mixed use is an emerging strategy that has been widely accepted in urban planning for promoting neighbourhood vibrancy, there is no consensus on how to quantitatively measure the mix and the effects of mixed use on neighbourhood vibrancy. Shannon entropy, the most commonly used diversity measurement in assessing mixed use, has been found to be inadequate in measuring the multifaceted, multidimensional characteristics of mixed use. And lack of data also makes it difficult to find the relationship between mixed use and neighbourhood vibrancy. However, the recent availability of new sources including mobile phone data and Point of Interest (POI) data have made it possible to develop new indices of mixed use and neighbourhood vibrancy to analyse their relationships. Taking advantage of these emerging new data sources, this study used the numbers of mobile phone users in a 24-hour period as a proxy of neighbourhood vibrancy and used POIs from a navigation database to develop a series of mixed-use indicators that can better reflect the multifaceted, multidimensional characteristics of mixed-use neighbourhoods. The Hill numbers, a unified form of diversity measurement used in ecological literature that includes richness, entropy, and the Simpson index, are used to measure the degrees of mixed use. Using such fine-grained data sets and the Hill numbers allowed us to obtain better insights into the relationship between mixed use and neighbourhood vibrancy. Four models varying in POI measurements that reflect different dimensions of mixed use were presented. The results showed that either POI density or entropy can explain approximately 1% of neighbourhood vibrancy, while POI richness contributes significantly in improving neighbourhood vibrancy. The results also revealed that the entropy has limitations as a measure for representing mixed use and demonstrated the necessity of adopting a set of more appropriate measurements for mixed use. Increasing the number of POIs has limited power to improve neighbourhood vibrancy compared with encouraging the mixing of complementary POIs. These exploratory findings may be useful for adjusting mixeduse assessments and to help guide urban planning and neighbourhood design.

"Pseudo-Complementary FET Logic : a Low-Power logic family in GaAs
This paper describes an efficient low-power static logic family in GaAs. Its behaviour mimics the one of CMOS, by compensating the lack of complementary transistors by the use of complementary logic signals. This Pseudo-Complementary FET Logic (PCFL) is fully compatible with Direct Coupled FET Logic. An original bootstrapping technique compensates the level degradation due to the use of enhancement-mode MESFETs only. The power consumption of an inverter is of the order of 10¿W at 100MHz. Preliminary measurement results on an inverter chain are reported.",0,1,1
"Sigma-Point Kalman Filters for Integrated Navigation
Core to integrated navigation systems is the concept of fusing noisy observations from GPS, Inertial Measurement Units (IMU), and other available sensors. The current industry standard and most widely used algorithm for this purpose is the extended Kalman filter (EKF) [6]. The EKF combines the sensor measurements with predictions coming from a model of vehicle motion (either dynamic or kinematic), in order to generate an estimate of the current navigational state (position, velocity, and attitude). This paper points out the inherent shortcomings in using the EKF and presents, as an alternative, a family of improved derivativeless nonlinear Kalman filters called sigma-point Kalman filters (SPKF). We demonstrate the improved state estimation performance of the SPKF by applying it to the problem of loosely coupled GPS/INS integration. A novel method to account for latency in the GPS updates is also developed for the SPKF (such latency compensation is typically inaccurate or not practical with the EKF). A UAV (rotor-craft) test platform is used to demonstrate the results. Performance metrics indicate an approximate 30% error reduction in both attitude and position estimates relative to the baseline EKF implementation.",0,1,1
"BagNet: Berkeley Analog Generator with Layout Optimizer Boosted with Deep Neural Networks
The discrepancy between post-layout and schematic simulation results continues to widen in analog design due in part to the domination of layout parasitics. This paradigm shift is forcing designers to adopt design methodologies that seamlessly integrate layout effects into the standard design flow. Hence, any simulation-based optimization framework should take into account time-consuming post-layout simulation results. This work presents a learning framework that learns to reduce the number of simulations of evolutionary-based combinatorial optimizers, using a DNN that discriminates against generated samples, before running simulations. Using this approach, the discriminator achieves at least two orders of magnitude improvement on sample efficiency for several large circuit examples including an optical link receiver layout.",0,1,0

"Leadership Through Influence: What Mechanisms Allow Leaders to Steer a Swarm?
Collective migration of cells and animals often relies on a specialised set of “leaders”, whose role is to steer a population of naive followers towards some target. We formulate a continuous model to understand the dynamics and structure of such groups, splitting a population into separate follower and leader types with distinct orientation responses. We incorporate leader influence via three principal mechanisms: a bias in the orientation of leaders towards the destination (orientation-bias), a faster movement of leaders when moving towards the target (speed-bias), and leaders making themselves more clear to followers when moving towards the target (conspicuousness-bias). Analysis and numerical computation are used to assess the extent to which the swarm is successfully shepherded towards the target. We find that successful leadership can occur for each of these three mechanisms across a broad region of parameter space, with conspicuousness-bias emerging as the most robust. However, outside this parameter space we also find various forms of unsuccessful leadership. Forms of excessive influence can result in either swarm-splitting, where the leaders break free and followers are left rudderless, or a loss of swarm cohesion that leads to its eventual dispersal. Forms of low influence, on the other hand, can even generate swarms that move away from the target direction. Leadership must therefore be carefully managed to steer the swarm correctly.",0,1,0

"A Simple Method to Determine Critical Coagulation Concentration from Electrophoretic Mobility
Critical coagulation concentration (CCC) is a key parameter of particle dispersions, since it provides the threshold limit of electrolyte concentrations, above which the dispersions are destabilized due to rapid particle aggregation. A computational method is proposed to predict CCC values using solely electrophoretic mobility data without the need to measure aggregation rates of the particles. The model relies on the DLVO theory; contributions from repulsive double-layer forces and attractive van der Waals forces are included. Comparison between the calculated and previously reported experimental CCC data for the same particles shows that the method performs well in the presence of mono and multivalent electrolytes provided DLVO interparticle forces are dominant. The method is validated for particles of various compositions, shapes, and sizes.",0,0,1
"Minimum snap trajectory generation and control for quadrotors
We address the controller design and the trajectory generation for a quadrotor maneuvering in three dimensions in a tightly constrained setting typical of indoor environments. In such settings, it is necessary to allow for significant excursions of the attitude from the hover state and small angle approximations cannot be justified for the roll and pitch. We develop an algorithm that enables the real-time generation of optimal trajectories through a sequence of 3-D positions and yaw angles, while ensuring safe passage through specified corridors and satisfying constraints on velocities, accelerations and inputs. A nonlinear controller ensures the faithful tracking of these trajectories. Experimental results illustrate the application of the method to fast motion (5–10 body lengths/second) in three-dimensional slalom courses.",0,1,1
"Aggregate Confusion: The Divergence of ESG Ratings

Based on data from six prominent rating agencies - namely, KLD (MSCI Stats), Sustainalytics, Vigeo Eiris (Moody's), RobecoSAM (SP Global), Asset4 (Refinitiv), and MSCI IVA- we decompose the divergence into three sources: different scope of categories, different measurement of categories, and different weights of categories. We find that scope and measurement divergence are the main drivers, while weights divergence is less important. In addition, we detect a rater effect where a rater's overall view of a firm influences the assessment of specific categories.",0,1,0
"On the MOSFET Threshold Voltage Extraction by Transconductance and Transconductance-to-Current Ratio Change Methods: Part II—Effect of Drain Voltage
In this paper, we study the effect of the drain voltage on the threshold voltage extraction in long-channel MOSFETs by the transconductance change and transconductance-to-current ratio change methods, using analytical modeling and experimental data obtained on advanced UTB SOI MOSFETs. It is shown that, although these two methods have the same physical background, they feature radically different behaviors with respect to the drain voltage effect. In particular, the transconductance change method yields a threshold voltage value, which regularly increases with drain voltage, and interpretation, as well as analytical expression for this dependence, is provided. In contrast, for the transconductance-to-current ratio change method, the increase of the extracted threshold voltage value with drain voltage is smaller and rapidly saturates; hence, the threshold voltage extraction is more stable and reliable. Modeling derivations are found to be in excellent agreement with measurements on long-channel UTB SOI MOSFETs as well as 2-D simulations.",0,1,1
"Electrochemical membrane microactuator with a millisecond response time
Abstract Lack of fast and strong actuators to drive microsystems is well recognized. Electrochemical actuators are considered attractive for many applications but they have long response time (minutes) due to slow gas termination. Here an electrochemical actuator is presented for which the response time can be as short as 1 ms. The alternating polarity water electrolysis is used to drive the device. In this process only nanobubbles are formed. The gas in nanobubbles can be terminated fast due to surface assisted reaction between hydrogen and oxygen that happens at room temperature. The working chamber of the actuator contains concentric titanium electrodes; it has a diameter of 500 μm and a height of 8 μm. The chamber is sealed by a polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) membrane of 30 μm thick. The device is characterized by an interferometer and a fast camera. Cyclic operation at frequency up to 667 Hz with a stroke of about 30% of the chamber volume is demonstrated. The cycles repeat themselves with high precision providing the volume strokes in picoliter range. Controlled explosions in the chamber can push the membrane up to 90 μm.",0,0,1
"Coordinating Clearance Markdown Sales of Seasonal Products in Retail Chains

We formulate a stochastic dynamic programming problem and develop heuristic solutions that approximate optimal solutions satisfactorily. To compare this methodology with current practices in the industry, we conducted two sets of experiments using the expertise of a product manager of a large retail company in Chile. In the first case, we contrast the performance of the proposed methodology with the revenues obtained during the 1995 autumn-winter season. In the second case, we compare it with the performance of the experienced product manager in a ""simulation-game"" setting. In both cases, our methodology provides significantly better results than those obtained by current practices.",0,1,0
"Relaminarization of Pipe Flow by Means of 3D-Printed Shaped Honeycombs
Based on a novel control scheme, where a steady modification of the streamwise velocity profile leads to complete relaminarization of initially fully turbulent pipe flow, we investigate the applicability and usefulness of custom-shaped honeycombs for such control. The custom-shaped honeycombs are used as stationary flow management devices which generate specific modifications of the streamwise velocity profile. Stereoscopic particle image velocimetry and pressure drop measurements are used to investigate and capture the development of the relaminarizing flow downstream these devices. We compare the performance of straight (constant length across the radius of the pipe) honeycombs with custom-shaped ones (variable length across the radius) and try to determine the optimal shape for maximal relaminarization at minimal pressure loss. The optimally modified streamwise velocity profile is found to be M-shaped, and the maximum attainable Reynolds number for total relaminarization is found to be of the order of 10,000. Consequently, the respective reduction in skin friction downstream of the device is almost by a factor of 5. The break-even point, where the additional pressure drop caused by the device is balanced by the savings due to relaminarization and a net gain is obtained, corresponds to a downstream stretch of distances as low as approximately 100 pipe diameters of laminar flow.",1,1,1
"Reliability Enhancement of MEMS Lateral Comb Resonators Under Fault Conditions
The delicate structure of microelectromechanical systems (MEMS) limits their reliability in cases of fault occurrence. Control systems can enhance their reliability of operation by providing fault robust systems. This paper illustrates a method for the safe operation of lateral comb resonators (LCR) under faulty conditions. Different types of fault are fabricated at chip level and experimentally tested in order to demonstrate the effectiveness of the reliability enhancement of operation in LCRs. Mass change and folded spring structural defects influence the device's behavior and reduce its reliability of operation. Here, model reference adaptive controllers (MRACs) are effectively used to enhance the reliability of faulty devices. Reliable operation of a +5% additional mass considering environmental conditions and asymmetries on the device, demand almost 80% higher control effort whereas +20% in case of broken trusses or +46% in case of adhesion point fault on a beam of folded springs. The simulation and experiment results demonstrate successful application of MRAC for reliable operation of LCRs by providing a fault-robust system.",0,1,1
"Deep Reinforcement Learning and Optimization Approach for Multi-echelon Supply Chain with Uncertain Demands
Deep Reinforcement Learning (RL) has been used recently in many areas achieving successful results. A multi-period supply chain operation can be viewed as a sequential decision-making problem for which Deep RL may be appropriate. Previous uses of such approach on related problems consider only serial or two-echelon supply chains with limited decision possibilities. In this research a four-echelon supply chain with two nodes per echelon and stochastic customer demands is considered. An MDP formulation and a Non-Linear Programming model of the problem are presented. Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO2) is used in order to find a good policy to operate the entire supply chain and minimize total operating costs. An agent based on a linearized model is used as a baseline. Experimental results indicate that PPO2 is a suitable and competitive approach for the proposed problem.",0,1,0
"Stress-stress fluctuation formula for elastic constants in the NPT ensemble.
Several fluctuation formulas are available for calculating elastic constants from equilibrium correlation functions in computer simulations, but the ones available for simulations at constant pressure exhibit slow convergence properties and cannot be used for the determination of local elastic constants. To overcome these drawbacks, we derive a stress-stress fluctuation formula in the NPT ensemble based on known expressions in the NVT ensemble. We validate the formula in the NPT ensemble by calculating elastic constants for the simple nearest-neighbor Lennard-Jones crystal and by comparing the results with those obtained in the NVT ensemble. For both local and bulk elastic constants we find an excellent agreement between the simulated data in the two ensembles. To demonstrate the usefulness of the formula, we apply it to determine the elastic constants of a simulated lipid bilayer.",0,0,1
"Review article: locomotion systems for ground mobile robots in unstructured environments
Abstract. The world market of mobile robotics is expected to increase substantially in the next 20 yr, surpassing the market of industrial robotics in terms of units and sales. Important fields of application are homeland security, surveillance, demining, reconnaissance in dangerous situations, and agriculture. The design of the locomotion systems of mobile robots for unstructured environments is generally complex, particularly when they are required to move on uneven or soft terrains, or to climb obstacles. This paper sets out to analyse the state-of-the-art of locomotion mechanisms for ground mobile robots, focussing on solutions for unstructured environments, in order to help designers to select the optimal solution for specific operating requirements. The three main categories of locomotion systems (wheeled – W, tracked – T and legged – L) and the four hybrid categories that can be derived by combining these main locomotion systems are discussed with reference to maximum speed, obstacle-crossing capability, step/stair climbing capability, slope climbing capability, walking capability on soft terrains, walking capability on uneven terrains, energy efficiency, mechanical complexity, control complexity and technology readiness.

"The Impacts of Convex Piecewise Linear Cost Formulations on AC Optimal Power Flow
Despite strong connections through shared application areas, research efforts on power market optimization (e.g., unit commitment) and power network optimization (e.g., optimal power flow) remain largely independent. A notable illustration of this is the treatment of power generation cost functions, where nonlinear network optimization has largely used polynomial representations and market optimization has adopted piecewise linear encodings. This work combines state-of-the-art results from both lines of research to understand the best mathematical formulations of the nonlinear AC optimal power flow problem with piecewise linear generation cost functions. An extensive numerical analysis of non-convex models, linear approximations, and convex relaxations across fifty-four realistic test cases illustrates that nonlinear optimization methods are surprisingly sensitive to the mathematical formulation of piecewise linear functions. The results indicate that a poor formulation choice can slow down algorithm performance by a factor of ten, increasing the runtime from seconds to minutes. These results provide valuable insights into the best formulations of nonlinear optimal power flow problems with piecewise linear cost functions, a important step towards building a new generation of energy markets that incorporate the nonlinear AC power flow model.",0,1,1
"Dynamic Metasurface Antennas for 6G Extreme Massive MIMO Communications
Next generation wireless base stations and access points will transmit and receive using an extremely massive numbers of antennas. A promising technology for realizing such massive arrays in a dynamically controllable and scalable manner with reduced cost and power consumption utilizes surfaces of radiating metamaterial elements, known as metasurfaces. To date, metasurfaces are mainly considered in the context of wireless communications as passive reflecting devices, aiding conventional transceivers in shaping the propagation environment. This article presents an alternative application of metasurfaces for wireless communications as active reconfigurable antennas with advanced analog signal processing capabilities for next generation transceivers. We review the main characteristics of metasurfaces used for radiation and reception, and analyze their main advantages as well as their capability to reliably communicate in wireless networks.

"Storage space allocation in container terminals
Container terminals are essential intermodal interfaces in the global transportation network. Efficient container handling at terminals is important in reducing transportation costs and keeping shipping schedules. In this paper, we study the storage space allocation problem in the storage yards of terminals. This problem is related to all the resources in terminal operations, including quay cranes, yard cranes, storage space, and internal trucks. We solve the problem using a rolling-horizon approach. For each planning horizon, the problem is decomposed into two levels and each level is formulated as a mathematical programming model. At the first level, the total number of containers to be placed in each storage block in each time period of the planning horizon is set to balance two types of workloads among blocks. The second level determines the number of containers associated with each vessel that constitutes the total number of containers in each block in each period, in order to minimize the total distance to transport the containers between their storage blocks and the vessel berthing locations. Numerical runs show that with short computation time the method significantly reduces the workload imbalance in the yard, avoiding possible bottlenecks in terminal operations.",0,0,0
"Fundamental Perceptual Characterization of an Integrated Tactile Display with Electrovibration and Electrical Stimuli
Tactile displays have been widely studied for many decades. Although multiple tactile stimuli are more effective to improve the quality of the presented tactile sensation, most tactile displays provide a single tactile stimulus. An integrated tactile display with electrovibration and electrical stimuli is proposed herein. It is expected that vibrational friction, pressure and vibration can be presented at the same time through the tactile display. Also, these stimuli only require electrodes for stimulation. Therefore, the tactile display can be easily miniaturized and densely arrayed on a substrate. In this study, a tactile display is designed and fabricated using the micro-fabrication process. Furthermore, the display is evaluated. First, the relationship between a single stimulus and the perception is investigated. The electrovibration and electrical stimuli have a frequency dependence on perception. Second, whether the multiple stimuli with the electrovibration and electrical stimuli are perceivable by the subjects is also evaluated. The results indicate that the multiple tactile stimuli are perceivable by the subjects. Also, the possibility that the electrovibration and electrical stimuli affect each other is confirmed.",0,1,1
"Identifying Damaged Buildings in Aerial Images Using the Object Detection Method
The collapse of buildings caused by the earthquake seriously threatened human lives and safety. So, the quick detection of collapsed buildings from post-earthquake images is essential for disaster relief and disaster damage assessment. Compared with the traditional building extraction methods, the methods based on convolutional neural networks perform better because it can automatically extract high-dimensional abstract features from images. However, there are still many problems with deep learning in the extraction of collapsed buildings. For example, due to the complex scenes after the earthquake, the collapsed buildings are easily confused with the background, so it is difficult to fully use the multiple features extracted by collapsed buildings, which leads to time consumption and low accuracy of collapsed buildings extraction when training the model. In addition, model training is prone to overfitting, which reduces the performance of model migration. This paper proposes to use the improved classic version of the you only look once model (YOLOv4) to detect collapsed buildings from the post-earthquake aerial images. Specifically, the k-means algorithm is used to optimally select the number and size of anchors from the image. We replace the Resblock in CSPDarkNet53 in YOLOv4 with the ResNext block to improve the backbone’s ability and the performance of classification. Furthermore, to replace the loss function of YOLOv4 with the Focal-EOIU loss function. The result shows that compared with the original YOLOv4 model, our proposed method can extract collapsed buildings more accurately. The AP (average precision) increased from 88.23% to 93.76%. The detection speed reached 32.7 f/s. Our method not only improves the accuracy but also enhances the detection speed of the collapsed buildings. Moreover, providing a basis for the detection of large-scale collapsed buildings in the future.",0,0,1

"COCrIP: Compliant OmniCrawler in-pipeline robot
This paper presents a modular in-pipeline climbing robot with a novel compliant foldable OmniCrawler mechanism. The robot has a series of 3 compliant foldable OmniCrawler modules interconnected by links via passive joints. The circular cross-section of the module enables a holonomic motion to facilitate the alignment of the robot in the direction of bends. Additionally, the crawler mechanism provides a fair amount of traction, even on slippery pipe surfaces. These advantages of crawler modules have been further augmented by incorporating active compliance in the module, which helps to negotiate sharp bends in small diameter pipes. Introducing compliance in the crawler module with a single chain-lugs assembly is the the key novelty of this design. For the desirable pipe diameter and curvature of the bends, the spring stiffness value for each passive joint is determined by formulating a constrained optimization problem using the quasi-static model of the robot. Moreover, a minimum friction coefficient value between the module-pipe surface which can be vertically climbed by the robot without slipping is estimated. The numerical simulation results have further been validated by experiments on real robot prototype.",1,1,1
"An Online De-icing Method Based on Single-Phase Grounding Fault Current for Distribution Lines
Distribution lines can continue to work for a period of time when a single-phase grounding fault occurs in non-effective grounding systems, because the current circulating through the fault point is small.

An arc suppression coil inductance set value is calculated by using single-phase ground fault current and load current. Adjusting the arc suppression coil inductance is bigger than or equal to set value. And a single-phase ground fault is set artificially at the end of distribution line, so that the generated fault current is bigger than the critical de-icing current to realize online de-icing without line outage.

"The Strategic Development Process
The strategic development process is defined here to embrace the management processes that inform, shape and support the strategic decisions confronting an organisation. We have adopted the term ‘strategic development’ for a number of reasons. Firstly, we see strategy formulation and implementation as inseparable activities in which every organisation engages on a continuous basis, so the idea of ongoing development is central to our thinking. Secondly, the widely used term ‘strategic planning’ has become debased by association with the creation of deterministic, one-shot 5and 10-year plans: for us this suggests an unhelpful rigidity in thinking about the future. Thirdly, ‘strategic management’ is too loose a term to describe the emphasis that we wish to place here upon reflective engagement and analytical questioning that characterises the approaches introduced in this book: nor does that term suggest the same focus upon the development of the organisation. Strategic decisions, the focus of the strategic development process, do not form a distinct category at one extreme of some imagined spectrum leading from tactical, through operational to strategic decisions. Rather, there is a set of characteristics that lead towards a decision being labelled as ‘strategic’. These characteristics include the following:",0,1,0
"An empirical approach to the relationship between emotion and music production quality
In music production, the role of the mix engineer is to take recorded music and convey the expressed emotions as professionally sounding as possible. We investigated the relationship between music production quality and musically induced and perceived emotions. A listening test was performed where 10 critical listeners and 10 non-critical listeners evaluated 10 songs. There were two mixes of each song, the low quality mix and the high quality mix. Each participant's subjective experience was measured directly through questionnaire and indirectly by examining peripheral physiological changes, change in facial expressions and the number of head nods and shakes they made as they listened to each mix. We showed that music production quality had more of an emotional impact on critical listeners. Also, critical listeners had significantly different emotional responses to non-critical listeners for the high quality mixes and to a lesser extent the low quality mixes. The findings suggest that having a high level of skill in mix engineering only seems to matter in an emotional context to a subset of music listeners.",0,1,0

"Is the PHY layer dead?
This article originates from a panel with the above title, held at IEEE VTC Spring 2009, in which the authors took part. The enthusiastic response it received prompted us to discuss for a wider audience whether research at the physical layer (PHY) is still relevant to the field of wireless communications. Using cellular systems as the axis of our exposition, we exemplify areas where PHY research has indeed hit a performance wall and where any improvements are expected to be marginal. We then discuss whether the research directions taken in the past have always been the right choice and how lessons learned could influence future policy decisions. Several of the raised issues are subsequently discussed in greater details, e.g., the growing divergence between academia and industry. With this argumentation at hand, we identify areas that are either under-developed or likely to be of impact in coming years - hence corroborating the relevance and importance of PHY research.",0,1,0
"Explainable AI for B5G/6G: Technical Aspects, Use Cases, and Research Challenges
When 5G began its commercialisation journey around 2020, the discussion on the vision of 6G also surfaced. Researchers expect 6G to have higher bandwidth, coverage, reliability, energy efficiency, lower latency, and, more importantly, an integrated “human-centric” network system powered by artificial intelligence (AI). Such a 6G network will lead to an excessive number of automated decisions made every second. These decisions can range widely, from network resource allocation to collision avoidance for self-driving cars. However, the risk of losing control over decision-making may increase due to high-speed data-intensive AI decision-making beyond designers and users’ comprehension. The promising explainable AI (XAI) methods can mitigate such risks by enhancing the transparency of the black box AI decision-making process. This survey paper highlights the need for XAI towards the upcoming 6G age in every aspect, including 6G technologies (e.g., intelligent radio, zero-touch network management) and 6G use cases (e.g., industry 5.0). Moreover, we summarised the lessons learned from the recent attempts and outlined important research challenges in applying XAI for building 6G systems. This research aligns with goals 9, 11, 16, and 17 of the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (UN-SDG) , promoting innovation and building infrastructure, sustainable and inclusive human settlement, advancing justice and strong institutions, and fostering partnership at the global level.",0,0,0

"Reinforcement Learning for Safety-Critical Control under Model Uncertainty, using Control Lyapunov Functions and Control Barrier Functions
In this paper, the issue of model uncertainty in safety-critical control is addressed with a data-driven approach. For this purpose, we utilize the structure of an input-ouput linearization controller based on a nominal model along with a Control Barrier Function and Control Lyapunov Function based Quadratic Program (CBF-CLF-QP). Specifically, we propose a novel reinforcement learning framework which learns the model uncertainty present in the CBF and CLF constraints, as well as other control-affine dynamic constraints in the quadratic program. The trained policy is combined with the nominal model-based CBF-CLF-QP, resulting in the Reinforcement Learning-based CBF-CLF-QP (RL-CBF-CLF-QP), which addresses the problem of model uncertainty in the safety constraints. The performance of the proposed method is validated by testing it on an underactuated nonlinear bipedal robot walking on randomly spaced stepping stones with one step preview, obtaining stable and safe walking under model uncertainty.",0,1,1
"An Optimized Standard Cell Design Methodology Targeting Low Parasitics and Small Area for Complementary FETs (CFETs)
The Complementary FET (CFET) is known to be a potential device to continue the feature size scaling. However, studies forecast that increased parasitic RC neutralizes the area reduction advantage that CFETs can provide. In this paper, (1) we report that RC increase by CFETs is not that significant (only +4.25% compared to 5 track FinFET INV), and (2) propose a design methodology that optimizes the parasitics of CFET standard cells to make this happen. Our methodology shows improvements in parasitics by up to 8.15% for capacitance and 32.73% for resistance when comparing the two types of CFET structures.",0,1,1
"Online Advertising Security: Issues, Taxonomy, and Future Directions
Online advertising has become the backbone of the Internet economy by revolutionizing business marketing. It provides a simple and efficient way for advertisers to display their advertisements to specific individual users, and over the last couple of years has contributed to an explosion in the income stream for several Web-based businesses. For example, Google’s income from advertising grew 51.6% between 2016 and 2018, to $\$ $ 136.8 billion. This exponential growth in advertising revenue has motivated fraudsters to exploit the weaknesses of the online advertising model to make money, and researchers to discover new security vulnerabilities in the model, to propose countermeasures and to forecast future trends in research. Motivated by these considerations, this paper presents a comprehensive review of the security threats to online advertising systems. We begin by introducing the motivation for online advertising system, explain how it differs from traditional advertising networks, introduce terminology, and define the current online advertising architecture. We then devise a comprehensive taxonomy of attacks on online advertising to raise awareness among researchers about the vulnerabilities of online advertising ecosystem. We discuss the limitations and effectiveness of the countermeasures that have been developed to secure entities in the advertising ecosystem against these attacks. To complete our work, we identify some open issues and outline some possible directions for future research towards improving security methods for online advertising systems.",0,1,0
"Modeling thermodynamic trends of rotating detonation engines
The formation of a number of co- and counter-rotating coherent combustion wave fronts is the hallmark feature of the Rotating Detonation Engine (RDE). The engineering implications of wave topology are not well understood nor quantified, especially with respect to parametric changes in combustor geometry, propellant chemistry, and injection and mixing schemes. In this article, a modeling framework that relates the time and spacial scales of the RDE to engineering performance metrics is developed and presented. The model is built under assumptions of backpressure-insensitivity and nominally choked gaseous propellant injection. The Euler equations of inviscid, compressible fluid flow in one dimension are adapted to model the combustion wave dynamics along the circumference of an annular-type rotating detonation engine. These adaptations provide the necessary mass and energy input and output channels to shape the traveling wave fronts and decaying tails. The associated unit processes of injection, mixing, combustion, and exhaust are all assigned representative time scales necessary for successful wave propagation. We find that the separation, or lack of, these time scales are responsible for the behavior of the system, including wave co- and counter-propagation and bifurcations between these regimes and wave counts. Furthermore, as there is no imposition of wave topology, the model output is used to estimate the net available mechanical work output and thermodynamic efficiency from the closed trajectories through pressure-volume and temperature-entropy spaces. These metrics are investigated with respect to variation in the characteristic scales for the RDE unit physical processes.",1,1,1
"Combining system identification with reinforcement learning-based MPC
In this paper we propose and compare methods for combining system identification (SYSID) and reinforcement learning (RL) in the context of data-driven model predictive control (MPC). Assuming a known model structure of the controlled system, and considering a parametric MPC, the proposed approach simultaneously: a) Learns the parameters of the MPC using RL in order to optimize performance, and b) fits the observed model behaviour using SYSID. Six methods that avoid conflicts between the two optimization objectives are proposed and evaluated using a simple linear system. Based on the simulation results, hierarchical, parallel projection, nullspace projection, and singular value projection achieved the best performance.",1,1,1
"Wideband Tapered Slot Antenna for D-Band Applications
This paper presents a wideband tapered slot antenna for D-band (110–170 GHz) applications. The antenna is fed by a substrate integrated waveguide (SIW) and achieves a simulated gain of 11.1 dBi at 170 GHz. The in-band gain variation is less than 3 dB. The designed SIW is based on a thin aluminium nitride (AlN) substrate with hollow plated vias working as the vertical conductor walls. The substrate is extended and inserted into a tapered slot antenna. The concept of designing SIW-fed tapered slot antenna is described in detail. The assembly structure is illustrated and the antenna radiation pattern is shown. The proposed SIW-fed tapered slot antenna also provides a wideband matching at D-band. The simulated return loss remains better than 18 dB from 110 GHz to 170 GHz which corresponds to a bandwidth of 43% at 140 GHz.",0,1,0
"Millimetre-wave FMCW MIMO radar system development using broadband SIW antennas
In this paper, a novel millimetre-wave radar for collision avoidance and automotive applications is presented. The system uses frequency modulated continuous-wave (FMCW) transmission based on multiple input multiple output (MIMO) substrate-integrate waveguide (SIW) antennas operating in the K-band regime. The continuous sawtooth time-domain wave transmitted from two SIW antennas, by time-domain multiple access (TDMA), is detected with a half-lambda spaced four-element SIW receiver array at a distance of 4 meters in a calibrated anechoic chamber and verified with simulations. The high bandwidth and omnidirectionality of the SIW antennas in the horizontal plane, together with digital-beamforming for the achieved MIMO virtual array, offers an overall field-of-view of 130 degrees for the radar system. Also, the MIMO radar achieves an angular resolution of 14 degrees and offers a range resolution of 10 cm at a cost of only 6 transmitter and receiver elements in total.",0,0,0
"Bottom-up Markov Chain Monte Carlo approach for scenario based residential load modelling with publicly available data
In the residential sector, with the introduction of electric vehicles and photovoltaics, developments are taking place which have an impact on residential load curves. In order to assess the integration of these new types of technologies on both the generation and load side, as well as to develop mitiga- tion strategies like demand side management, detailed information is required about the load curve of a household. To gain knowledge about this load curve a residential load model is developed based on publicly available data. The model utilises a Markov Chain Monte Carlo method to model the occupancy in a household based on time use surveys, which together with weather variables, neighbourhood char- acteristics and behavioural data are used to model the switching pattern of appliances. The modelling approach described in this paper is applied for the situation in the Netherlands. The resulting load curve probability distributions are validated with smart meter measurements for 100 Dutch households for a week. The validation shows that the model presented in this paper can be employed for further studies on demand side management approaches and integration issues of new appliances in distribution grids.",0,0,1
"Utilizing Players’ Playtime Records for Churn Prediction: Mining Playtime Regularity
Churn prediction is an important topic in the free online game industry. Reducing the churn rate of a game significantly helps with the success of the game. Churn prediction helps a game operator identify possible churning players and keep them engaged in the game via appropriate operational strategies, marketing strategies, and/or incentives. Playtime-related features are some of the widely used universal features for most churn prediction models. In this article, we consider developing new universal features for churn predictions for long-term players based on playtime. In particular, we measure playtime regularity using the notion of entropy and cross-entropy from information theory. After computing playtime regularity of players from the datasets of six free online games of different types, we leverage information from the playtime regularity in the form of universal features for churn prediction. Experiments show that the proposed features are better at predicting churners compared to the baseline features, implying that the proposed features could utilize the information extracted from playtime more effectively than the related baseline playtime features.",0,0,0
"Agrivoltaic Farm Design: Vertical Bifacial vs. Tilted Monofacial Photovoltaic Panels
An unprecedented demand for Food, Energy, and Water (FEW) over coming decades require integrated FEW innovations with least environmental footprint. Collocating solar photovoltaic (PV) technology with agriculture is a promising approach towards dual land productivity that could locally fulfil growing food and energy demands. This 'agrivoltaic' (AV) solution can be highly suitable for hot and arid climates where an optimized solar panel coverage could prevent excessive thermal stress thereby increasing the crop yield and lowering the water budget. One of the concerns with using standard fixed tilt solar array structure that faces north/south (N/S) direction for AV farming is the spatial heterogeneity in the daily sunlight distribution for crops and soil water contents, both of which could affect crop yield. Dynamic tilt control through a tracking system can eliminate this problem but could increase the system cost and complexity. Here, we investigate east/west (E/W) faced vertical bifacial panel structure for AV farming and show that this could provide a much better spatial homogeneity for daily sunlight distribution relative to the fixed tilt N/S faced PV structure implying a better suitability for monoculture cropping. By modeling PV energy and crop yield under varying density (row to row pitch) for PV arrays and shade tolerances for crops, we show that E/W vertical bifacial panels can provide ~5% better land productivity as compared to N/S faced fixed tilt panels for Lahore (31.520N, 74.358E) when PV array density is slightly lower than that of a standard solar farm. In contrast, when PV arrays are denser than the standard, land productivity for E/W vertical bifacial panels degrades due to mutual shading. These results, together with high inherent resilience to soiling (dust accumulation) losses for E/W vertical bifacial panels, indicate their attractive prospects for AV applications.",0,0,1

"Angular Momentum about the Contact Point for Control of Bipedal Locomotion: Validation in a LIP-based Controller
In the control of bipedal locomotion, linear velocity of the center of mass has been widely accepted as a primary variable for summarizing a robot's state vector. The ubiquitous massless-legged linear inverted pendulum (LIP) model is based on it. In this paper, we argue that angular momentum about the contact point has several properties that make it superior to linear velocity for feedback control. So as not to confuse the benefits of angular momentum with any other control design decisions, we first reformulate the standard LIP controller in terms of angular momentum. We then implement the resulting feedback controller on the 20 degree-of-freedom bipedal robot, Cassie Blue, where each leg accounts for nearly one-third of the robot's total mass of 35~Kg. Under this controller, the robot achieves fast walking, rapid turning while walking, large disturbance rejection, and locomotion on rough terrain. The reasoning developed in the paper is applicable to other control design philosophies, whether they be Hybrid Zero Dynamics or Reinforcement Learning.",0,0,1
"Doppler Influence on Waveform Orthogonality in 79 GHz MIMO Phase-Coded Automotive Radar
Utilization of phase-coded waveforms in automotive MIMO radars for short to medium range applications is studied. Performances of three most-promising binary code families (Gold, APAS and ZCZ sequences) are compared. Design trade-offs of practical implementation of phased-coded waveforms for MIMO radar are analyzed for the first time for a possible future System on Chip implementation. Orthogonality of the waveforms in case of moving targets is analyzed. The implications of the code properties for the Range-Doppler map, as well as the Range-Angular map, are pointed out. Doppler frequency shift impact on such performance indicators as the target peak power and range sidelobe levels in the range-Doppler plane, as well as the range and azimuth sidelobe behavior, and the angular error in the azimuthal plane have been comprehensively studied for the first time. It is shown that the time-staggered transmit scheme with autocorrelation properties only (while introducing azimuthal errors) results in improved performance compared to code division multiplexing with auto- and cross-correlation properties.",0,0,0

"Dispatch of Virtual Inertia and Damping: Numerical Method with SDP and ADMM
Abstract Power grids are evolving toward 100% renewable energy interfaced by inverters. Virtual inertia and damping provided by inverters are essential to synchronism and frequency stability of future power grids. This paper numerically addresses the problem of dispatch of virtual inertia and damping (DID) among inverters in the transmission network. The DID problem is first formulated as a nonlinear program (NLP) by the Radua collocation method which is flexible to handle various types of disturbances and bounds constraints. Since the NLP of DID is highly non-convex, semi-definite programming (SDP) relaxation for the NLP is further derived to tackle the non-convexity, followed by its sparsity being exploited hierarchically based on chordality of graphs to seek enhancement of computational efficiency. Considering high dimension and inexactness of the SDP relaxation, a feasibility-embedded distributed approach is finally proposed under the framework of alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM), which achieves parallel computing and solution feasibility regarding the original NLP. Numerical simulations carried out for five test power systems demonstrate the proposed method and necessity of DID.",1,1,1

"A New Metric for Lumpy and Intermittent Demand Forecasts: Stock-keeping-oriented Prediction Error Costs
Forecasts of product demand are essential for short- and long-term optimization of logistics and production. Thus, the most accurate prediction possible is desirable. In order to optimally train predictive models, the deviation of the forecast compared to the actual demand needs to be assessed by a proper metric. However, if a metric does not represent the actual prediction error, predictive models are insufficiently optimized and, consequently, will yield inaccurate predictions. The most common metrics such as MAPE or RMSE, however, are not suitable for the evaluation of forecasting errors, especially for lumpy and intermittent demand patterns, as they do not sufficiently account for, e.g., temporal shifts (prediction before or after actual demand) or cost-related aspects. 
Therefore, we propose a novel metric that, in addition to statistical considerations, also addresses business aspects. Additionally, we evaluate the metric based on simulated and real demand time series from the automotive aftermarket.",0,0,0
"Wind turbine fault diagnosis based on transfer learning and convolutional autoencoder with small-scale data
Abstract Condition monitoring and fault diagnosis for wind turbines can effectively reduce the impact of failures. However, many wind turbines cannot establish fault diagnosis models due to insufficient data. The operational data of similar wind turbines usually contain some universal information about failure properties. In order to make full use of these useful information, a fault diagnosis method based on parameter-based transfer learning and convolutional autoencoder (CAE) for wind turbines with small-scale data is proposed in this paper. The proposed method can transfer knowledge from similar wind turbines to the target wind turbine. The performance of the proposed method is analyzed and compared to other transfer/non-transfer methods. The comparison results show that the proposed method has advantages in diagnosing faults for wind turbines with small-scale data.",0,0,1
"Low-Shapiro hydrostatic reconstruction technique for blood flow simulation in large arteries with varying geometrical and mechanical properties
The purpose of this work is to construct a simple, efficient and accurate well-balanced numerical scheme for one-dimensional (1D) blood flow in large arteries with varying geometrical and mechanical properties. As the steady states at rest are not relevant for blood flow, we construct two well-balanced hydrostatic reconstruction techniques designed to preserve low-Shapiro number steady states that may occur in large network simulations. The Shapiro number S h = u / c is the equivalent of the Froude number for shallow water equations and the Mach number for compressible Euler equations. The first is the low-Shapiro hydrostatic reconstruction (HR-LS), which is a simple and efficient method, inspired from the hydrostatic reconstruction technique (HR). The second is the subsonic hydrostatic reconstruction (HR-S), adapted here to blood flow and designed to exactly preserve all subcritical steady states. We systematically compare HR, HR-LS and HR-S in a series of single artery and arterial network numerical tests designed to evaluate their well-balanced and wave-capturing properties. The results indicate that HR is not adapted to compute blood flow in large arteries as it is unable to capture wave reflections and transmissions when large variations of the arteries' geometrical and mechanical properties are considered. On the contrary, HR-S is exactly well-balanced and is the most accurate hydrostatic reconstruction technique. However, HR-LS is able to compute low-Shapiro number steady states as well as wave reflections and transmissions with satisfying accuracy and is simpler and computationally less expensive than HR-S. We therefore recommend using HR-LS for 1D blood flow simulations in large arterial network simulations. Two new hydrostatic reconstruction techniques are introduced for blood flow.Both preserve low-Shapiro steady states relevant for blood flow.Both accurately capture wave reflections for arbitrary large impedance variations.Capturing wave reflections is necessary for large pathological network simulations.",0,0,1

The low backlash planetary gearbox as a substitute for a harmonic drive in humanoid robotics, is presented in this paper. After analysis of the contemporary designs of the low backlash coaxial toothed gearboxes, a concept of planetary gearbox with taper gears has been chosen. A synthesis of a planetary mechanism which satisfies the prescribed kinematic-dynamic requirements as well as the design limitations has been performed.

"Bioremediation of oil and heavy metal contaminated soil in construction sites: a case study of using bioventing-biosparging and phytoextraction techniques
This paper studies the bioremediation techniques utilized for degrading soil pollutants in a construction site located in Iran. The activities in a construction site, located in Garmdareh, Karaj, polluted the soil environment with a large amount of contaminants among which BTEX, PAHs and heavy metals are considered to be the most important components. Employing conventional physicochemical techniques for remediation of such a polluted soil is both technically and economically challenging. Bioremediation, which involves taking advantage of the microorganisms for the removal of pollutants, is the most promising technology which is both relatively efficient and cost-effective. In this study, the coupled bioventing-biosparging technique and the phytoextraction process were utilized to remediate the deep and shallow layers of the polluted environment, respectively. However, the widespread presence of the cement components in the site influenced the performance of bioremediation techniques. The results of this study indicated that the cement- polluted soil lowered the degradation rate of both BTEX (Ethylbenzene) and PAH (Pyrene) pollutants within deep layers. Conversely, the degradation rate of Pb was increased in phytoextraction process due to proper stabilization of the surficial soil in presence of cement components. This study provides a critical view on the limitations and influential parameters of function-directed soil remediation techniques dealing with the presence of cementitious materials in construction sites.",0,0,1
"A Target Wake Time Scheduling Scheme for Uplink Multiuser Transmission in IEEE 802.11ax-Based Next Generation WLANs
IEEE 802.11ax Wireless Local Area Networks (WLANs) introduce Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiple Access (OFDMA) physical layer technology to improve throughput in dense scenarios. In order to save power of battery operated stations (STAs), a novel broadcast Target Wake Time (TWT) operation for negotiating wake time between an access point (AP) and a group of STAs is also proposed by making full use of the new capability of uplink OFDMA-based multiuser transmissions. However, if the wake time of each STA which is determined by the offset and wake interval (listen interval) is not properly scheduled, deteriorated throughput and high power consumption occur because of collisions. In this paper, we take the advantage of uplink multiuser transmission with the novel TWT scheduling to maximize throughput. We first investigate the fundamental relationship between throughput and energy efficiency with several key aspects, such as the number of simultaneously active STAs, the number of eligible random access resource units, and the contention window size. We further derive the formulations of throughput and energy efficiency on the listen interval of each STA. Based on the relationship, a TWT-based sleep/wake-up scheduling scheme (TSS) is proposed to improve the throughput by reducing or even cancelling collisions. Simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness in terms of average throughput and energy efficiency. The TSS also makes a practical step towards a collision-free and deterministic access in future WLANs when cooperating with TWT service period scheduling.",0,0,0
"Regularized Online Allocation Problems: Fairness and Beyond
Online allocation problems with resource constraints have a rich history in computer science and operations research. In this paper, we introduce the \emph{regularized online allocation problem}, a variant that includes a non-linear regularizer acting on the total resource consumption. In this problem, requests repeatedly arrive over time and, for each request, a decision maker needs to take an action that generates a reward and consumes resources. The objective is to simultaneously maximize total rewards and the value of the regularizer subject to the resource constraints. Our primary motivation is the online allocation of internet advertisements wherein firms seek to maximize additive objectives such as the revenue or efficiency of the allocation. By introducing a regularizer, firms can account for the fairness of the allocation or, alternatively, punish under-delivery of advertisements---two common desiderata in internet advertising markets. We design an algorithm when arrivals are drawn independently from a distribution that is unknown to the decision maker. Our algorithm is simple, fast, and attains the optimal order of sub-linear regret compared to the optimal allocation with the benefit of hindsight. Numerical experiments confirm the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm and of the regularizers in an internet advertising application.",0,0,0

The paper describes an integrated approach for modeling and robust multivariable controller design, with application to temperature control of diffusion and CVD furnaces. The modeling relies on input-output data, collected in a preliminary identification experiment at the desired operating conditions. An important component of the identification is the computation of uncertainty bounds that describe the confidence limits of the model, in a manner consistent with robust control theory. The results of the identification are then used to design an H-infinity controller with a cascade, hierarchical structure. The final implementation of the controller also includes mechanisms to prevent integrator wind-up. Special emphasis is placed on automating the procedure-for classes of furnaces-so that, potentially, it can be used by nonexperts in the field. Implementations include several industrial furnaces.

"Learning quadrupedal locomotion over challenging terrain
A learning-based locomotion controller enables a quadrupedal ANYmal robot to traverse challenging natural environments. Legged locomotion can extend the operational domain of robots to some of the most challenging environments on Earth. However, conventional controllers for legged locomotion are based on elaborate state machines that explicitly trigger the execution of motion primitives and reflexes. These designs have increased in complexity but fallen short of the generality and robustness of animal locomotion. Here, we present a robust controller for blind quadrupedal locomotion in challenging natural environments. Our approach incorporates proprioceptive feedback in locomotion control and demonstrates zero-shot generalization from simulation to natural environments. The controller is trained by reinforcement learning in simulation. The controller is driven by a neural network policy that acts on a stream of proprioceptive signals. The controller retains its robustness under conditions that were never encountered during training: deformable terrains such as mud and snow, dynamic footholds such as rubble, and overground impediments such as thick vegetation and gushing water. The presented work indicates that robust locomotion in natural environments can be achieved by training in simple domains.",0,0,1
"Deep Neural Net with Attention for Multi-channel Multi-touch Attribution
Customers are usually exposed to online digital advertisement channels, such as email marketing, display advertising, paid search engine marketing, along their way to purchase or subscribe products( aka. conversion). The marketers track all the customer journey data and try to measure the effectiveness of each advertising channel. The inference about the influence of each channel plays an important role in budget allocation and inventory pricing decisions. Several simplistic rule-based strategies and data-driven algorithmic strategies have been widely used in marketing field, but they do not address the issues, such as channel interaction, time dependency, user characteristics. In this paper, we propose a novel attribution algorithm based on deep learning to assess the impact of each advertising channel. We present Deep Neural Net With Attention multi-touch attribution model (DNAMTA) model in a supervised learning fashion of predicting if a series of events leads to conversion, and it leads us to have a deep understanding of the dynamic interaction effects between media channels.

In this letter, the problem of pilot contamination in a multi-cell massive multiple input multiple output (M-MIMO) system is addressed using deep reinforcement learning (DRL). To this end, a pilot assignment strategy is designed that adapts to the channel variations while maintaining a tolerable pilot contamination effect. Using the angle of arrival (AoA) information of the users, a cost function, portraying the reward, is presented, defining the pilot contamination effects in the system. Numerical results illustrate that the DRL-based scheme is able to track the changes in the environment, learn the near-optimal pilot assignment, and achieve a close performance to that of the optimum pilot assignment performed by exhaustive search, while maintaining a low computational complexity.",0,0,0

Most existing literature, however, focuses almost exclusively on telescoping leg models with only radial actuation, overlooking possible uses of hip torque actuation for running behaviors.",0,0,1
"Multiple-Depot Vehicle Scheduling Problem Heuristics
The Multiple-Depot Vehicle Scheduling Problem (MDVSP) is very important in the planning process of transport systems. It consists in assigning a set of trips to a set of vehicles in order to minimize a certain total cost. We introduce three fast and reliable heuristics for MDVSP based on a classical integer linear programming formulation and on graph theoretic methods of fixing the infeasible subtours gathered from an integer solution. Extensive experimentations using a large set of benchmark instances show that our heuristics are faster and give good or even better results compared with other existing heuristics.",0,1,0
"Set Partition Modulation
In this paper, we propose a novel modulation scheme called set partition modulation (SPM). In this scheme, set partitioning and ordered subsets in the set partitions are used to form codewords. We define different SPM variants and depict a practical model for using SPM with orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM). For the OFDM-SPM schemes, different constellations are used to distinguish between different subsets in a set partition. It is shown that the proposed SPM variants are general schemes, which encompass multi-mode OFDM with index modulation (MM-OFDM-IM) and dual-mode OFDM with index modulation (DM-OFDM-IM) as special cases. It is also shown that OFDM-SPM schemes are capable of exhibiting better error performance than conventional OFDM, OFDM-IM, DM-OFDM-IM, and MM-OFDM-IM.",0,0,0
"Aleatory or epistemic? Does it matter?
The sources and characters of uncertainties in engineering modeling for risk and reliability analyses are discussed. While many sources of uncertainty may exist, they are generally categorized as either aleatory or epistemic. Uncertainties are characterized as epistemic, if the modeler sees a possibility to reduce them by gathering more data or by refining models. Uncertainties are categorized as aleatory if the modeler does not foresee the possibility of reducing them. From a pragmatic standpoint, it is useful to thus categorize the uncertainties within a model, since it then becomes clear as to which uncertainties have the potential of being reduced. More importantly, epistemic uncertainties may introduce dependence among random events, which may not be properly noted if the character of uncertainties is not correctly modeled. Influences of the two types of uncertainties in reliability assessment, codified design, performance-based engineering and risk-based decision-making are discussed. Two simple examples demonstrate the influence of statistical dependence arising from epistemic uncertainties on systems and time-variant reliability problems.",0,1,1
"Reinforcement learning in financial markets - a survey
The advent of reinforcement learning (RL) in financial markets is driven by several advantages inherent to this field of artificial intelligence. In particular, RL allows to combine the ""prediction"" and the ""portfolio construction"" task in one integrated step, thereby closely aligning the machine learning problem with the objectives of the investor. At the same time, important constraints, such as transaction costs, market liquidity, and the investor's degree of risk-aversion, can be conveniently taken into account. Over the past two decades, and albeit most attention still being devoted to supervised learning methods, the RL research community has made considerable advances in the finance domain. The present paper draws insights from almost 50 publications, and categorizes them into three main approaches, i.e., critic-only approach, actor-only approach, and actor-critic approach. Within each of these categories, the respective contributions are summarized and reviewed along the representation of the state, the applied reward function, and the action space of the agent. This cross-sectional perspective allows us to identify recurring design decisions as well as potential levers to improve the agent's performance. Finally, the individual strengths and weaknesses of each approach are discussed, and directions for future research are pointed out.",0,0,0
"VIRTUAL BRAINSTORMING AND CREATIVITY: AN ANALYSIS OF MEASURES, AVATARS, ENVIRONMENTS, INTERFACES, AND APPLICATIONS
Abstract How to enhance creativity, especially by applying new technologies to creativity methods, is a question posed continuously by researchers. One reason for this is that creativity is an important part of people's daily lives and an essential component of society. Therefore, many methods to enhance creativity have been created, especially brainstorming, which is one of the most popular and effective tools that inspire individuals to generate ideas, hence enhancing creativity. Moreover, technologies, such as virtual reality (VR), provide an opportunity for individuals and groups to be creative. In response, recent studies have adopted VR in brainstorming to enhance creativity. However, there is a lack of systematic analysis of experimental approaches and creativity measures employed in this context. Addressing this question, this study categorized existing articles on the topic related to categories of avatars, environments, interfaces, or applications. The findings elaborate on trends, measures employed to evaluate creativity and idea generation, identified categories, and results of these studies.",0,0,0
"Two-scale micropolar plate model for web-core sandwich panels
Abstract A 2-D micropolar equivalent single-layer (ESL), first-order shear deformation (FSDT) plate model for 3-D web-core sandwich panels is developed. First, a 3-D web-core unit cell is modeled by classical shell finite elements. A discrete-to-continuum transformation is applied to the microscale unit cell and its strain and kinetic energy densities are expressed in terms of the macroscale 2-D plate kinematics. The hyperelastic constitutive relations and the equations of motion (via Hamilton’s principle) for the plate are derived by assuming energy equivalence between the 3-D unit cell and the 2-D plate. The Navier solution is developed for the 2-D micropolar ESL-FSDT plate model to study the bending, buckling, and free vibration of simply-supported web-core sandwich panels. In a line load bending problem, a 2-D classical ESL-FSDT plate model yields displacement errors of 34–175% for face sheet thicknesses of 2–10 mm compared to a 3-D FE solution, whereas the 2-D micropolar model gives only small errors of 2.7–3.4% as it can emulate the 3-D deformations better through non-classical antisymmetric shear behavior and local bending and twisting.",1,1,1
"Revisiting Few-sample BERT Fine-tuning
We study the problem of few-sample fine-tuning of BERT contextual representations, and identify three sub-optimal choices in current, broadly adopted practices. First, we observe that the omission of the gradient bias correction in the BERTAdam optimizer results in fine-tuning instability. We also find that parts of the BERT network provide a detrimental starting point for fine-tuning, and simply re-initializing these layers speeds up learning and improves performance. Finally, we study the effect of training time, and observe that commonly used recipes often do not allocate sufficient time for training. In light of these findings, we re-visit recently proposed methods to improve few-sample fine-tuning with BERT and re-evaluate their effectiveness. Generally, we observe a decrease in their relative impact when modifying the fine-tuning process based on our findings.",0,1,0

"Task Interruption in Soware Development Projects
Multitasking has always been an inherent part of soware development and is known as the primary source of interruptions due to task switching in soware development teams. Developing soware involves a mix of analytical and creative work, and requires a signicant load on brain functions, such as working memory and decision making. us, task switching in the context of soware development imposes a cognitive load that causes soware developers to lose focus and concentration while working thereby taking a toll on productivity. To investigate the disruptiveness of task switching and interruptions in soware development projects, and to understand the reasons for and perceptions of the disruptiveness of task switching we used a mixed-methods approach including a longitudinal data analysis on 4,910 recorded tasks of 17 professional soware developers, and a survey of 132 soware developers. We found that, compared to task-specic factors (e.g. priority, level, and temporal stage), contextual factors such as interruption type (e.g. self/external), time of day, and task type and context are a more potent determinant of task switching disruptiveness in soware development tasks. Furthermore, while most survey respondents believe external interruptions are more disruptive than self-interruptions, the results of our retrospective analysis reveals otherwise. We found that self-interruptions (i.e. voluntary task switchings) are more disruptive than external interruptions and have a negative eect on the performance of the interrupted tasks. Finally, we use the results of both studies to provide a set of comparative vulnerability and interaction paerns which can be used as a mean to guide decision-making and forecasting the consequences of task switching in soware development teams.",1,1,0
"Control Design of Dynamic Virtual Power Plants: An Adaptive Divide-and-Conquer Approach
In this paper, we present a novel control approach for dynamic virtual power plants (DVPPs). In particular, we consider a group of heterogeneous distributed energy resources (DERs) which collectively provide desired dynamic ancillary services such as fast frequency and voltage control. Our control approach relies on an adaptive divide-and-conquer strategy: first, we disaggregate the desired frequency and voltage control specifications of the aggregate DVPP via adaptive dynamic participation matrices (ADPMs) to obtain the desired local behavior for each device. Second, we design local linear parameter-varying (LPV) $\mathcal {H}_\infty$ controllers to optimally match this local behaviors. In the process, the control design also incorporates the physical and engineered limits of each DVPP device. Furthermore, our adaptive control design can properly respond to fluctuating device capacities, and thus include weather-driven DERs into the DVPP setup. Finally, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our control strategy in a case study based on the IEEE nine-bus system.",0,0,1

"The Roles of Users in Electric, Shared and Automated Mobility Transitions
Abstract This paper synthesizes insights from 19 peer-reviewed articles published in this Special Issue on the roles of users in electric, shared and automated mobility. While many researchers and stakeholders remain inspired by the potential low costs and societal benefits of these innovations, less is known about the real-world potential for uptake and usage. To better understand the likelihood and impacts of widespread uptake, we explore the perceptions of actual and potential users, including drivers, passengers, owners, and members, as well as other stakeholders such as pedestrians, planners, and policymakers. The Special Issue examines a range of cases, including plug-in electric vehicles, car-share and bike-share programs, ride-hailing and automated vehicles. For each innovation, we organize insights on user perceptions of benefits and drawbacks into four categories. Much of the research to date focuses on the first category, private-functional perceptions, mainly total cost of ownership (e.g., $/km), time use and comfort. Our synthesis however spans to the three other categories for each innovation: private-symbolic perceptions include the potential for social signaling and communicating identity; societal-functional perceptions include GHG emissions, public safety and noise; and societal-symbolic perceptions include inspiring pro-societal behavior in others, and the potential to combat or reinforce the status quo system of “automobility”. Further, our synthesis demonstrates how different theories and methods can be more or less equipped to “see” different perception categories. We also summarize findings regarding the characteristics of early users, as well as practical insights for strategies and policies seeking societally-beneficial outcomes from mass deployment of these innovations.",0,0,0
"Feedback control by low-order modelling of the laminar flow past a bluff body
In this work a two-dimensional laminar flow past a square cylinder is considered. Actuators placed on the cylinder enable active control by blowing and suction. Proportional feedback control is then applied using velocity measurements taken in the cylinder wake. Projection onto an empirical subspace is combined with a calibration technique to build a low-order model of the incompressible Navier–Stokes equations. This model is used within an optimization method to determine a set of feedback gains which reduces the unsteadiness of the wake at Re = 150. The resulting controlled flows are further characterized by computing the critical Reynolds numbers for the onset of the vortex shedding instability.",0,0,1
"Automatic Design of Dispatching Rules for Job Shop Scheduling with Genetic Programming
Scheduling is an important planning activity in manufacturing systems to help optimise the usage of scarce resources and improve the customer satisfaction. In the job shop manufacturing environment, scheduling problems are challenging due to the complexity of production flows and practical requirements such as dynamic changes, uncertainty, multiple objectives, and multiple scheduling decisions. Also, job shop scheduling (JSS) is very common in small manufacturing businesses and JSS is considered one of the most popular research topics in this domain due to its potential to dramatically decrease the costs and increase the throughput.  Practitioners and researchers have applied different computational techniques, from different fields such as operations research and computer science, to deal with JSS problems. Although optimisation methods usually show their dominance in the literature, applying optimisation techniques in practical situations is not straightforward because of the practical constraints and conditions in the shop. Dispatching rules are a very useful approach to dealing with these environments because they are easy to implement(by computers and shop floor operators) and can cope with dynamic changes. However, designing an effective dispatching rule is not a trivial task and requires extensive knowledge about the scheduling problem.   The overall goal of this thesis is to develop a genetic programming based hyper-heuristic (GPHH) approach for automatic heuristic design of reusable and competitive dispatching rules in job shop scheduling environments. This thesis focuses on incorporating special features of JSS in the representations and evolutionary search mechanisms of genetic programming(GP) to help enhance the quality of dispatching rules obtained.  This thesis shows that representations and evaluation schemes are the important factors that significantly influence the performance of GP for evolving dispatching rules. The thesis demonstrates that evolved rules which are trained to adapt their decisions based on the changes in shops are better than conventional rules. Moreover, by applying a new evaluation scheme, the evolved rules can effectively learn from the mistakes made in previous completed schedules to construct better scheduling decisions. The GP method using the newproposed evaluation scheme shows better performance than the GP method using the conventional scheme.  This thesis proposes a new multi-objective GPHH to evolve a Pareto front of non-dominated dispatching rules. Instead of evolving a single rule with assumed preferences over different objectives, the advantage of this GPHH method is to allow GP to evolve rules to handle multiple conflicting objectives simultaneously. The Pareto fronts obtained by the GPHH method can be used as an effective tool to help decision makers select appropriate rules based on their knowledge regarding possible trade-offs. The thesis shows that evolved rules can dominate well-known dispatching rules when a single objective and multiple objectives are considered. Also, the obtained Pareto fronts show that many evolved rules can lead to favourable trade-offs, which have not been explored in the literature.   This thesis tackles one of themost challenging issues in job shop scheduling, the interactions between different scheduling decisions. New GPHH methods have been proposed to help evolve scheduling policies containing multiple scheduling rules for multiple scheduling decisions. The two decisions examined in this thesis are sequencing and due date assignment. The experimental results show that the evolved scheduling rules are significantly better than scheduling policies in the literature. A cooperative coevolution approach has also been developed to reduce the complexity of evolving sophisticated scheduling policies. A new evolutionary search mechanisms and customised genetic operations are proposed in this approach to improve the diversity of the obtained Pareto fronts.",0,0,0
"Adjoint-based shape optimization for the minimization of flow-induced hemolysis in biomedical applications
This paper reports on the derivation and implementation of a shape optimization procedure for the minimization of hemolysis induction in blood flows through biomedical devices.Despite the significant progress in relevant experimental studies, the ever-growing advances in computational science have made computational fluid dynamics an indispensable tool for the design of biomedical devices. However, even the latter can lead to a restrictive cost when the model requires an extensive number of computational elements or when the simulation needs to be overly repeated. This work aims at the formulation of a continuous adjoint complement to a power-law hemolysis prediction model dedicated to efficiently identifying the shape sensitivity to hemolysis. The proposed approach can accompany any gradient-based optimization method at the cost of approximately one additional flow solution per shape update. The approach is verified against analytical solutions of a benchmark problem and computed sensitivity derivatives are validated by a finite differences study on a generic 2D stenosed geometry. The included application addresses a 3D ducted geometry which features typical characteristics of blood-carrying devices. An optimized shape, leading to a potential improvement up to 22%, is identified. It is shown that the improvement persists for different hemolysis-evaluation parameters.",1,0,1

"A Deep Q-Network for the Beer Game: Deep Reinforcement Learning for Inventory Optimization
Problem definition: The beer game is widely used in supply chain management classes to demonstrate the bullwhip effect and the importance of supply chain coordination. The game is a decentralized, multiagent, cooperative problem that can be modeled as a serial supply chain network in which agents choose order quantities while cooperatively attempting to minimize the network’s total cost, although each agent only observes local information. Academic/practical relevance: Under some conditions, a base-stock replenishment policy is optimal. However, in a decentralized supply chain in which some agents act irrationally, there is no known optimal policy for an agent wishing to act optimally. Methodology: We propose a deep reinforcement learning (RL) algorithm to play the beer game. Our algorithm makes no assumptions about costs or other settings. As with any deep RL algorithm, training is computationally intensive, but once trained, the algorithm executes in real time. We propose a transfer-learning approach so that training performed for one agent can be adapted quickly for other agents and settings. Results: When playing with teammates who follow a base-stock policy, our algorithm obtains near-optimal order quantities. More important, it performs significantly better than a base-stock policy when other agents use a more realistic model of human ordering behavior. We observe similar results using a real-world data set. Sensitivity analysis shows that a trained model is robust to changes in the cost coefficients. Finally, applying transfer learning reduces the training time by one order of magnitude. Managerial implications: This paper shows how artificial intelligence can be applied to inventory optimization. Our approach can be extended to other supply chain optimization problems, especially those in which supply chain partners act in irrational or unpredictable ways. Our RL agent has been integrated into a new online beer game, which has been played more than 17,000 times by more than 4,000 people.",0,1,0

"Voluntary Disclosure and Personalized Pricing
A concern central to the economics of privacy is that firms may use consumer data to price discriminate. A common response is that consumers should have control over their data and the ability to choose how firms access it. Since firms draw inferences based on both the data seen as well as the consumer's disclosure choices, the strategic implications of this proposal are unclear. We investigate whether such measures improve consumer welfare in monopolistic and competitive environments. We find that consumer control can guarantee gains for every consumer type relative to both perfect price discrimination and no personalized pricing. This result is driven by two ideas. First, consumers can use disclosure to amplify competition between firms. Second, consumers can share information that induces a seller---even a monopolist---to make price concessions. Furthermore, whether consumer control improves consumer surplus depends on both the technology of disclosure and the competitiveness of the marketplace. In a competitive market, simple disclosure technologies such as ""track / do-not-track'' suffice for guaranteeing gains in consumer welfare. However, in a monopolistic market, welfare gains require richer forms of disclosure technology whereby consumers can decide how much information they would like to convey.",0,1,0

"Strongly-coupled aeroelastic free-vortex wake framework for floating offshore wind turbine rotors. Part 2: Application
Abstract This two-part paper presents the integration of the free-vortex wake method (FVM) with an aeroelastic framework suitable to model the rotor-wake interactions engendered by floating offshore wind turbine (FOWT) rotors in operation. Part 1 of this paper introduces the numerical development and validation of an aeroelastic framework. Due to a lack of experimental aeroelastic benchmarks for FOWTs, a series of validation studies are conducted against the rotor aerodynamic and structural performance of the National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) 5-MW reference wind turbine. Part 2 of this paper focuses on the modeling and simulating different aeroelastic operational conditions of FOWTs. Numerical results of the current framework capture consistently the aerodynamic rotor performance, such as power, thrust, and torque of wave-induced pitching FOWTs. In addition, the presented aeroelastic framework yields additional information about the power, thrust, and torque fluctuations due to the out-of-phase blade passing frequency and corresponding blade deflections. The fidelity of the presented framework demonstrates, for the first time, an FVM-based aeroelastic method capable of carrying out investigations on rotor-wake interactions and relevant aeroelastic phenomena of FOWTs.",0,0,1

"Global sensitivity analysis of frequency band gaps in one-dimensional phononic crystals
Phononic crystals have been widely employed in many engineering fields, which is due to their unique feature of frequency band gaps. For example, their capability to filter out the incoming elastic waves, which include seismic waves, will have a significant impact on the seismic safety of nuclear infrastructure. In order to accurately design the desired frequency band gaps, one must pay attention on how the input parameters and the interaction of the parameters can affect the frequency band gaps. Global sensitivity analysis can decompose the dispersion relationship of the phononic crystals and screen the variance attributed to each of the parameters and the interaction between them. Prior to the application in one-dimensional (1D) phononic crystals, this paper will first review the theory of global sensitivity analysis using variance decomposition (Sobol sensitivity analysis). Afterwards, the sensitivity analysis is applied to study a simple mathematical model with three input variables for better understanding of the concept. Then, the sensitivity analysis is utilized to study the characteristic of the first frequency band gap in 1D phononic crystals with respect to the input parameters. This study reveals the quantified influence of the parameters and their correlation in determining the first frequency band gap. In addition, simple straight-forward design equations based on reduced Sobol functions are proposed to easily estimate the first frequency band gap. Finally, the error associated with the proposed design equations is also addressed.",0,0,1

"Application of the fast Fourier transform to broadband beamforming
The processing of broadband signals using an array of sensors is normally carried out in a time domain using a tapped delay line filter or in a frequency domain where each frequency channel is weighed by complex weights and no tapped delay line filter is required. The time domain implementation of the broadband structure is important in the area of communication where the frequency domain implementation may not be suitable due to its associated delay. This paper derives relationships between the weights, the array correlation matrices, and the constraints on the weights of the two structures to produce identical results. These relationships are then used to update the weights of the tapped delay line filter structure using narrow‐band techniques. The method has potential for computational saving to estimate weights of the broadband structure, for a large bandwidth signal requiring a long tapped delay line filter.",0,0,0
"A cut-and-fold self-sustained compliant oscillator for autonomous actuation of origami-inspired robots
Origami-inspired robots are of particular interest due to their potential for rapid and accessible design and fabrication of elegant designs and complex functionalities through cutting and folding of flexible two-dimensional sheets or even strings, that is, printable manufacturing. Yet, origami robots still require bulky rigid components or electronics for actuation and control to accomplish tasks with reliability, programmability, ability to output substantial force, and durability, restricting their full potential. In this study, we present a printable self-sustained compliant oscillator that generates periodic actuation using only constant electrical power, without discrete components or electronic control hardware. This oscillator is robust (9 out of 10 prototypes worked successfully on the first try), configurable (with tunable periods from 3 to 12 s), powerful (can overcome hydrodynamic resistance to consistently propel a swimmer at ∼1.6 body lengths/min or 3.66 mm/s), and long lasting (∼103 cycles); it enables driving macroscale devices with prescribed autonomous behaviors, for example, locomotion and sequencing. This oscillator is also fully functional underwater and in high magnetic fields. Our analytical model characterizes essential parameters of the oscillation period, enabling programmable design of the oscillator. The printable oscillator can be integrated into origami-inspired systems seamlessly and monolithically, allowing rapid design and prototyping; the resulting integrated devices are lightweight, low cost, compliant, electronic free, and nonmagnetic, enabling practical applications in extreme areas. We demonstrate the functionalities of the oscillator with: (1) autonomous gliding of a printable swimmer, (2) LED flashing, and (3) fluid stirring. This work paves the way for realizing fully printable autonomous robots with high integration of actuation and control.",0,1,1
"UX Research on Conversational Human-AI Interaction: A Literature Review of the ACM Digital Library
Early conversational agents (CAs) focused on dyadic human-AI interaction between humans and the CAs, followed by the increasing popularity of polyadic human-AI interaction, in which CAs are designed to mediate human-human interactions. CAs for polyadic interactions are unique because they encompass hybrid social interactions, i.e., human-CA, human-to-human, and human-to-group behaviors. However, research on polyadic CAs is scattered across different fields, making it challenging to identify, compare, and accumulate existing knowledge. To promote the future design of CA systems, we conducted a literature review of ACM publications and identified a set of works that conducted UX (user experience) research. We qualitatively synthesized the effects of polyadic CAs into four aspects of human-human interactions, i.e., communication, engagement, connection, and relationship maintenance. Through a mixed-method analysis of the selected polyadic and dyadic CA studies, we developed a suite of evaluation measurements on the effects. Our findings show that designing with social boundaries, such as privacy, disclosure, and identification, is crucial for ethical polyadic CAs.

"Impact of IEEE 802.11n/ac PHY/MAC High Throughput Enhancements over Transport/Application Layer Protocols - A Survey
Since the inception of Wireless Local Area Networks (WLANs) in the year 1997, it has tremendously grown in the last few years. IEEE 802.11 is popularly known as WLAN. To provide the last mile wireless broadband connectivity to users, IEEE 802.11 is enriched with IEEE 802.11a, IEEE 802.11b and IEEE 802.11g. More recently, IEEE 802.11n, IEEE 802.11ac and IEEE 802.11ad are introduced with enhancements to the physical (PHY) layer and medium access control (MAC) sublayer to provide much higher data rates and thus these amendments are called High Throughput WLANs (HT-WLANs). For both standards, PHY is enhanced with multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) antenna technologies, channel bonding, short guard intervals (SGI), enhanced modulation and coding schemes (MCS). At the same time, MAC layer overhead is reduced by introducing frame aggregation and block acknowledgement technologies. However, existing studies reveal that although PHY and MAC enhancements promise to improve physical data rate significantly, they yield negative impact over upper layer protocols -- mainly for reliable end-to-end transport/application layer protocols. As a consequence, a large number of schools have focused researches on HT-WLANs to improve the coordination among PHY/MAC and upper layer protocols and thus, boost up the performance benefit. In this survey, we discuss the impact of enhancements of PHY/MAC layer in HT-WLANs over transport/application layer protocols. list down different open challenges that can be explored for the development of next generation HT-WLAN technologies.",0,0,0
"Hybrid Models and Digital Twins for Condition Monitoring: HVAC System for Railway
Safety passenger transportation is more important than efficiency or reliability. Therefore, it is vital to maintain the proper condition of the equipment related to the passengers’ comfort and safety. This manuscript presents the methodology of complete development and implementation of both hybrid model and digital twin 3.0 for an HVAC in railways. The objective of this is to monitor the condition of the HVAC where it matters to the comfort and safety of the passengers in the trains. The level 3.0 of digital twin will be developed for the diagnosis and prognosis of HVAC by using hybrid modeling. The description illustrated in this paper is focused on the methodology used to implement a hybrid model-based approach, and both the need and advantages of using hybrid model approaches instead of data-based approaches. The development considers the importance of safety and environmental risks, which are included in the risk quantification of failure modes. Railway’s maintainers replace critical components in early stages of degradation; thus, the use of a data-driven model loses essential information related to advanced stages of degradation which might decrease the accuracy of the maintenance instructions provided. Physics-based model can be used to generate synthetic data to overcome the lack of data in advanced stages of degradation, and then, the synthetic data can be combined with the real data, which is collected by sensor located in the real system, to build the data-driven model. The combination leads to form hybrid-model based approach with a large number of failure modes that were unpredictable. Finally, the outcome is beneficial for the proper functioning of systems; hence, safety of the passengers. Introduction The diagnostics and prognostics are the main processes in condition-based maintenance (CBM). These processes are broadly used in industrial assets, mainly, at levels of part, components, sub-systems, and systems. Fault detection and diagnostics (FDD) is the identification of a faulty component through the detection and isolation of a fault. Once a fault appears in a system, diagnostics process might detect that fault and identify the faulty part. Prognostics process is performed for estimating the remaining useful life (RUL) of a system. It is estimated using the behavior data while the system works, allowing maintainers to avoid the corrective maintenance [1]. Thus, appropriate implementation of CBM leads to reduce costs and increase the reliability and safety of systems. As it is shown in Figure 1, there are highlighted four techniques for estimating the RUL and, on a consequence, for implementing FDD and prognostics processes [1]: experience-based approaches, model-based approaches, data-driven approaches, and hybrid modelbased approaches (HyMAs). Figure 1: Remaining useful life (RUL) estimation models. SNE 31(3), 2021, 121-126, DOI: 10.11128/sne.31.tn.10572 Received: March 10, 2021 (Selected EUROSIM 2019 Postconf. Publ.), Revised: August 30, 2021; Accepted: September 2, 2021 SNE Simulation Notes Europe, ARGESIM Publisher Vienna, ISSN Print 2305-9974, Online 2306-0271, www.sne-journal.org Gálvez et al. Hybrid Models and Digital Twins for Condition Monitoring: HVAC System for Railway 122 SNE 31(3) – 9/2021 T N The model-based approach are mathematical models of the physical system [2]. These models incorporate such characteristics as material properties, thermodynamic, and mechanical responses. Furthermore, different operational conditions, components defect, and degradation must be modelled for fault detection. Thus, these models accurately describe the behaviour of systems [3] [4]. Data-driven approaches use operational data collected by sensors embedded in the system for obtaining information related to the degradation state of components. Thus, these approaches can trace the relationship between the data acquired from the system with its degradation [5] [6]. As Figure 1 shows, HyMAs is the combination of data-driven and model-based approaches. The main advantage of this combination is the reduction in both the historical information required to train a data-driven model and the information needed for a robust physicsbased model. This data fusion aims to improve FDD and prognostics processes. The model-based approaches generates synthetic data to overcome the lack of historical data, thus improving the ability of a data-driven apprach to detect failure modes (FMs) and reducing the appearance of hidden FMs, metaphorically known as “black swan losses” [7]. 1 Problem Discussion The case study used in this research work is a heating, ventilation and air conditioning (HVAC) system which is installed in a high-speed passenger train. Currently, many types of research are based on datadriven approaches but missing important information and failures. This occurs because maintainers replace critical elements in early stages of degradation for safety, reliability, economic, and environmental reasons. Therefore, it is challenging to acquire data in faulty stages of the system and advanced stages of degradation [3]. The solution proposed in this manuscript is to transfer the methodology to railway subsystems to scale, develop, and validate an HyMAs for railway equipment through the combination of modeling based on physical laws and modeling based on data. As a primary purpose, it will be developed to improve the diagnostics and prognostics processes of components of railway systems. The outcome will be to provide railway companies with the necessary tools to reach a level 3 of digital twin based on HyMA.

"Airfoil's Aerodynamic Coefficients Prediction using Artificial Neural Network
Figuring out the right airfoil is a crucial step in the preliminary stage of any aerial vehicle design, as its shape directly affects the overall aerodynamic characteristics of the aircraft or rotorcraft. Besides being a measure of performance, the aerodynamic coefficients are used to design additional subsystems such as a flight control system, or predict complex dynamic phenomena such as aeroelastic instability. The coefficients in question can either be obtained experimentally through wind tunnel testing or, depending upon the accuracy requirements, by numerically simulating the underlying fundamental equations of fluid dynamics. In this paper, the feasibility of applying Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) to estimate the aerodynamic coefficients of differing airfoil geometries at varying Angle of Attack, Mach and Reynolds number is investigated. The ANNs are computational entities that have the ability to learn highly nonlinear spatial and temporal patterns. Therefore, they are increasingly being used to approximate complex real-world phenomenon. However, despite their significant breakthrough in the past few years, ANNs’ spreading in the field of Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) is fairly recent, and many applications within this field remain unexplored. This study thus compares different network architectures and training datasets in an attempt to gain insight as to how the network perceives the given airfoil geometries, while producing an acceptable neuronal model for faster and easier prediction of lift, drag and moment coefficients in steady state, incompressible flow regimes. This data-driven method produces sufficiently accurate results, with the added benefit of saving high computational and experimental costs.

"Interactions of Grid-Forming Power Converters and Synchronous Machines -- A Comparative Study
An inevitable consequence of the global power system transition towards nearly 100% renewable-based generation is the loss of conventional bulk generation by synchronous machines, their inertia, and accompanying frequency and voltage control mechanisms. This gradual transformation of the power system to a low-inertia system leads to critical challenges in maintaining system stability. Novel control techniques for converters, so-called grid-forming strategies, are expected to address these challenges and replicate functionalities that so far have been provided by synchronous machines. We present a low-inertia high-fidelity case study that includes synchronous machines and models of grid-forming converters. We study interactions between synchronous machines and converters and analyze the response of various grid-forming control approaches to contingencies, i.e., large changes in load and the loss of a synchronous machine. Our case study highlights the positive impact of the grid-forming converters on frequency stability and analyze the potential limitations of each control technique when interacting with synchronous machines. Our studies also analyze how and when the interaction between the fast grid-forming converter, the dc source and ac current limitations, and the slow synchronous machine dynamics contributes to system instability. Lastly, we introduce an effective solution to address the instability issues due to the GFCs ac and dc current limitation.",0,1,1
"Vision-Based High-Speed Driving With a Deep Dynamic Observer
In this letter, we present a framework for combining deep learning-based road detection, particle filters, and model predictive control (MPC) to drive aggressively using only a monocular camera, IMU, and wheel speed sensors. This framework uses deep convolutional neural networks combined with LSTMs to learn a local cost map representation of the track in front of the vehicle. A particle filter uses this dynamic observation model to localize in a schematic map, and MPC is used to drive aggressively using this particle filter based state estimate. We show extensive real world testing results and demonstrate reliable operation of the vehicle at the friction limits on a complex dirt track. We reach speeds above 27 m/h (12 m/s) on a dirt track with a 105 ft (32 m) long straight using our 1:5 scale test vehicle.",0,1,1
"Synchroextracting Transform
In this paper, we introduce a new time-frequency (TF) analysis (TFA) method to study the trend and instantaneous frequency (IF) of nonlinear and nonstationary data. Our proposed method is termed the synchroextracting transform (SET), which belongs to a postprocessing procedure of the short-time Fourier transform (STFT). Compared with classical TFA methods, the proposed method can generate a more energy concentrated TF representation and allow for signal reconstruction. The proposed SET method is inspired by the recently proposed synchrosqueezing transform (SST) and the theory of the ideal TFA. To analyze a signal, it is important to obtain the time-varying information, such as the IF and instantaneous amplitude. The SST is to squeeze all TF coefficients into the IF trajectory. Differ from the squeezing manner of SST, the main idea of SET is to only retain the TF information of STFT results most related to time-varying features of the signal and to remove most smeared TF energy, such that the energy concentration of the novel TF representation can be enhanced greatly. Numerical and real-world signals are employed to validate the effectiveness of the SET method.",0,1,1
"Driver Modeling Based on Driving Behavior and Its Evaluation in Driver Identification
All drivers have habits behind the wheel. Different drivers vary in how they hit the gas and brake pedals, how they turn the steering wheel, and how much following distance they keep to follow a vehicle safely and comfortably. In this paper, we model such driving behaviors as car-following and pedal operation patterns. The relationship between following distance and velocity mapped into a two-dimensional space is modeled for each driver with an optimal velocity model approximated by a nonlinear function or with a statistical method of a Gaussian mixture model (GMM). Pedal operation patterns are also modeled with GMMs that represent the distributions of raw pedal operation signals or spectral features extracted through spectral analysis of the raw pedal operation signals. The driver models are evaluated in driver identification experiments using driving signals collected in a driving simulator and in a real vehicle. Experimental results show that the driver model based on the spectral features of pedal operation signals efficiently models driver individual differences and achieves an identification rate of 76.8% for a field test with 276 drivers, resulting in a relative error reduction of 55% over driver models that use raw pedal operation signals without spectral analysis",0,0,1
"Characterizing an automation level-based safety assessment tool to improve fluency in safe human cobot interaction
In the current manufacturing era of advanced automation, cobots, and robots play an integral role in any manufacturing operation. Collaborative robots can share a workspace with humans to carry out day to day operations with safety. Although there are a lot of studies in the field of industrial-size robots and cobots and their programs or algorithms to make them safer, faster, efficient, the number of OSHA reported accidents due to cobots and robots has not decreased. Even though these cobots are considered inherently safe, they open more probability for accidents because they are not caged. Therefore, it is necessary for the manufacturing industries using cobots to consider the risk involved in human cobot interaction and the ways to attain safety and lower the risk of injury before installing cobots on assembly lines. This study has developed a lightweight cobot and a user-centric tool to perform a physical and psychological risk assessment using processfailure mode effect analysis (PFMEA) for different automation levels in human cobot interaction. A detailed analysis involving stratification of potential failure modes, their types, causes and effects are discussed, and the failure modes or safety incidents are then ranked based on severity, occurrence and detection. The study also tries to correlate the respiratory rate or heart rate and stress involved in human cobot interaction to improve fluency in assembly operation. The developed assessment tool generates a quantitative as well as qualitative assessment consisting of RPN and CN scores. It suggests recommended actions and various CAPA options to curtail physical injury. The tool also offers different training modules for the operators based on their perception of safety and the stress level involved in the assembly operation to reduce behavioral risks. Thus, the generated results provide insights about safety analysis that can be used by manufacturers to improve safe human cobot interaction.",0,1,0
"Investigation on the Performance of a Ducted Propeller in Oblique Flow
In this study, the ducted propeller has been numerically investigated under oblique flow, which is crucial and challenging for the design and safe operation of the thruster driven vessel and dynamic positioning (DP) system. A Reynolds-averaged Navier–Stokes (RANS) model has been first evaluated in the quasi-steady investigation on a single ducted propeller operating in open water condition, and then a hybrid RANS/LES model is adapted for the transient sliding mesh computations. A representative test geometry considered here is a marine model thruster, which is discretized with structured hexahedral cells, and the gap between the blade tip and nozzle is carefully meshed to capture the flow dynamics. The computational results are assessed by a systematic grid convergence study and compared with the available experimental data. As a part of the novel contribution, multiple incidence angles from 15 deg to 60 deg have been analyzed with different advance coefficients. The main emphasis has been placed on the hydrodynamic loads that act on the propeller blades and nozzle as well as their variation with different configurations. The results reveal that while the nozzle absorbs much effort from the oblique flow, the imbalance between blades at different positions is still noticeable. Such unbalance flow dynamics on the blades, and the nozzle has a direct implication on the variation of thrust and torque of a marine thruster.",0,0,1
"How do Agile Software Startups deal with uncertainties by Covid-19 pandemic?
The dissipation of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has already taken on pandemic proportions, affecting over 100 countries in a couple of weeks.

"Apollo: A Sequencing-Technology-Independent, Scalable, and Accurate Assembly Polishing Algorithm
MOTIVATION
Third-generation sequencing technologies can sequence long reads that contain as many as 2 million base pairs (bp). These long reads are used to construct an assembly (i.e., the subject's genome), which is further used in downstream genome analysis. Unfortunately, third-generation sequencing technologies have high sequencing error rates and a large proportion of bps in these long reads are incorrectly identified. These errors propagate to the assembly and affect the accuracy of genome analysis. Assembly polishing algorithms minimize such error propagation by polishing or fixing errors in the assembly by using information from alignments between reads and the assembly (i.e., read-to-assembly alignment information). However, current assembly polishing algorithms can only polish an assembly using reads either from a certain sequencing technology or from a small assembly. Such technology-dependency and assembly-size dependency require researchers to 1) run multiple polishing algorithms and 2) use small chunks of a large genome to use all available read sets and polish large genomes, respectively.


RESULTS
We introduce Apollo, a universal assembly polishing algorithm that scales well to polish an assembly of any size (i.e., both large and small genomes) using reads from all sequencing technologies (i.e., second- and third-generation). Our goal is to provide a single algorithm that uses read sets from all available sequencing technologies to improve the accuracy of assembly polishing and that can polish large genomes. Apollo 1) models an assembly as a profile hidden Markov model (pHMM), 2) uses read-to-assembly alignment to train the pHMM with the Forward-Backward algorithm, and 3) decodes the trained model with the Viterbi algorithm to produce a polished assembly. Our experiments with real read sets demonstrate that Apollo is the only algorithm that 1) uses reads from any sequencing technology within a single run and 2) scales well to polish large assemblies without splitting the assembly into multiple parts.

"Accelerated ADMM based Trajectory Optimization for Legged Locomotion with Coupled Rigid Body Dynamics
Trajectory optimization is becoming increasingly powerful in addressing motion planning problems of under-actuated robotic systems. Numerous prior studies solve such a class of large non-convex optimal control problems in a hierarchical fashion. However, numerical accuracy issues are prone to occur when one uses a full-order model to track reference trajectories generated from a reduced-order model. This study investigates an approach of Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers (ADMM) and proposes a new splitting scheme for legged locomotion problems. Rigid body dynamics constraints and other general constraints such as box and cone constraints are decomposed to multiple sub-problems in a principled manner. The resulting multi-block ADMM framework enables us to leverage the efficiency of an unconstrained optimization method–Differential Dynamical Programming–to iteratively solve the optimizations using centroidal and wholebody models. Furthermore, we propose a Stage-wise Accelerated ADMM with over-relaxation and varying-penalty schemes to improve the overall convergence rate. We evaluate and validate the performance of the proposed ADMM algorithm on a car-parking example and a bipedal locomotion problem over rough terrains.",0,1,1
"Sector coupling via hydrogen to lower the cost of energy system decarbonization
There is growing interest in hydrogen (H2) use for long-duration energy storage in a future electric grid dominated by variable renewable energy (VRE) resources. Modelling the role of H2 as grid-scale energy storage, often referred as “power-to-gas-to-power (P2G2P)” overlooks the cost-sharing and emission benefits from using the deployed H2 production and storage assets to also supply H2 for decarbonizing other end-use sectors where direct electrification may be challenged. Here, we develop a generalized modelling framework for co-optimizing energy infrastructure investment and operation across power and transportation sectors and the supply chains of electricity and H2, while accounting for spatio-temporal variations in energy demand and supply. Applying this sector-coupling framework to the U.S. Northeast under a range of technology cost and carbon price scenarios, we find a greater value of power-to-H2 (P2G) versus P2G2P routes. P2G provides flexible demand response, while the extra cost and efficiency penalties of P2G2P routes make the solution less attractive for grid balancing. The effects of sector-coupling are significant, boosting renewable energy generation by 12-55% with both increased capacities and reduced curtailments and reducing the total system cost (or levelized costs of energy) by 6-14% under 96% decarbonization scenarios. Both the cost savings and emission reductions from sector coupling increase with H2 demand for other end-uses, more than doubling for a 96% decarbonization scenario as H2 demand quadraples. Moreover, we found that the deployment of carbon capture and storage is more cost-effective in the H2 sector because of the lower cost and higher utilization rate. These findings highlight the importance of using an integrated multi-sector energy system framework with multiple energy vectors in planning energy system decarbonization pathways.",0,1,1
"The Soft-Landing Problem: Minimizing Energy Loss by a Legged Robot Impacting Yielding Terrain
Enabling robots to walk and run on yielding terrain is vital to endeavors ranging from disaster response to extraterrestrial exploration. While dynamic legged locomotion on rigid ground is challenging enough, yielding terrain presents additional challenges such as ground deformation which dissipates energy. In this paper, we examine the soft-landing problem: given some impact momentum, bring the robot to rest while minimizing foot penetration depth. To gain insight into properties of penetration depth-minimizing control policies, we formulate a constrained optimal control problem and obtain a bang-bang open-loop force profile. Motivated by examples from biology and recent advances in legged robotics, we also examine impedance-control solutions to the soft-landing problem. Through simulations and experiments, we find that optimal impedance reduces penetration depth nearly as much as the open-loop force profile, while remaining robust to model uncertainty. Lastly, we discuss the relevance of this work to minimum-cost-of-transport locomotion for several actuator design choices.",0,0,1
"A practical guide to multi-objective reinforcement learning and planning
Real-world sequential decision-making tasks are generally complex, requiring trade-offs between multiple, often conflicting, objectives. Despite this, the majority of research in reinforcement learning and decision-theoretic planning either assumes only a single objective, or that multiple objectives can be adequately handled via a simple linear combination. Such approaches may oversimplify the underlying problem and hence produce suboptimal results. This paper serves as a guide to the application of multi-objective methods to difficult problems, and is aimed at researchers who are already familiar with single-objective reinforcement learning and planning methods who wish to adopt a multi-objective perspective on their research, as well as practitioners who encounter multi-objective decision problems in practice. It identifies the factors that may influence the nature of the desired solution, and illustrates by example how these influence the design of multi-objective decision-making systems for complex problems.",0,1,0

"Dark Patterns after the GDPR: Scraping Consent Pop-ups and Demonstrating their Influence
New consent management platforms (CMPs) have been introduced to the web to conform with the EU's General Data Protection Regulation, particularly its requirements for consent when companies collect and process users' personal data. This work analyses how the most prevalent CMP designs affect people's consent choices. We scraped the designs of the five most popular CMPs on the top 10,000 websites in the UK (n=680). We found that dark patterns and implied consent are ubiquitous; only 11.8% meet our minimal requirements based on European law. Second, we conducted a field experiment with 40 participants to investigate how the eight most common designs affect consent choices. We found that notification style (banner or barrier) has no effect; removing the opt-out button from the first page increases consent by 22-23 percentage points; and providing more granular controls on the first page decreases consent by 8-20 percentage points. This study provides an empirical basis for the necessary regulatory action to enforce the GDPR, in particular the possibility of focusing on the centralised, third-party CMP services as an effective way to increase compliance.",0,1,0
"Agrivoltaic Farm Design: Vertical Bifacial vs. Tilted Monofacial Photovoltaic Panels
An unprecedented demand for Food, Energy, and Water (FEW) over coming decades require integrated FEW innovations with least environmental footprint. Collocating solar photovoltaic (PV) technology with agriculture is a promising approach towards dual land productivity that could locally fulfil growing food and energy demands. This 'agrivoltaic' (AV) solution can be highly suitable for hot and arid climates where an optimized solar panel coverage could prevent excessive thermal stress thereby increasing the crop yield and lowering the water budget. One of the concerns with using standard fixed tilt solar array structure that faces north/south (N/S) direction for AV farming is the spatial heterogeneity in the daily sunlight distribution for crops and soil water contents, both of which could affect crop yield. Dynamic tilt control through a tracking system can eliminate this problem but could increase the system cost and complexity. Here, we investigate east/west (E/W) faced vertical bifacial panel structure for AV farming and show that this could provide a much better spatial homogeneity for daily sunlight distribution relative to the fixed tilt N/S faced PV structure implying a better suitability for monoculture cropping. By modeling PV energy and crop yield under varying density (row to row pitch) for PV arrays and shade tolerances for crops, we show that E/W vertical bifacial panels can provide ~5% better land productivity as compared to N/S faced fixed tilt panels for Lahore (31.520N, 74.358E) when PV array density is slightly lower than that of a standard solar farm. In contrast, when PV arrays are denser than the standard, land productivity for E/W vertical bifacial panels degrades due to mutual shading. These results, together with high inherent resilience to soiling (dust accumulation) losses for E/W vertical bifacial panels, indicate their attractive prospects for AV applications.",1,1,1
"Move fast and break things
The Cambridge Analytica scandal revealed some of Facebook’s questionable practices of sharing user data with third parties. While this led to a lot of data protection concerns, other legal qualifications are equally important for the correction of commercial behaviour. This paper explores the applicability of the Unfair Commercial Practices Directive (UCPD) to the Cambridge Analytica incident. It adds value to existing scholarship in two ways: first, it provides a detailed technical overview of the inner workings of Facebook as a social media platform by describing its Graph Application Programming Interface (API); and second, it addresses a literature gap by discussing the applicability of unfair commercial practices law to the social media industry in the light of European harmonisation within the consumer protection policy area, as well as between consumer and data protection. In doing so, we argue that Facebook practices may be deemed unfair according to the UCPD, by either using point 20 of Annex I, by applying Articles 6-7 on misleading actions or omissions, or by using the general test in Article 5. We find that the test in Articles 8-9 on aggressive practices is not met. The UCPD fits the data-driven economy because of its princi-ple-based regulatory approach; however, the aftermath of the Cambridge Analytica incident reveals a lot of further questions regarding the internal cohesion of the European legislative framework, as well as potential tensions between consumer and data protection law.",0,0,0
"Weak ties strengthen anger contagion in social media
Increasing evidence suggests that, similar to face-to-face communications, human emotions also spread in online social media. However, the mechanisms underlying this emotion contagion, for example, whether different feelings spread in unlikely ways or how the spread of emotions relates to the social network, is rarely investigated. Indeed, because of high costs and spatio-temporal limitations, explorations of this topic are challenging using conventional questionnaires or controlled experiments. Because they are collection points for natural affective responses of massive individuals, online social media sites offer an ideal proxy for tackling this issue from the perspective of computational social science. In this paper, based on the analysis of millions of tweets in Weibo, surprisingly, we find that anger travels easily along weaker ties than joy, meaning that it can infiltrate different communities and break free of local traps because strangers share such content more often. Through a simple diffusion model, we reveal that weaker ties speed up anger by applying both propagation velocity and coverage metrics. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time that quantitative long-term evidence has been presented that reveals a difference in the mechanism by which joy and anger are disseminated. With the extensive proliferation of weak ties in booming social media, our results imply that the contagion of anger could be profoundly strengthened to globalize its negative impact.",0,0,0

This paper presents an adaptive trajectory tracking neural network control using radial basis function (RBF) for an n-link robot manipulator with robust compensator to achieve the high-precision position tracking. One of the difficulties in designing a suitable control scheme which can achieve accurate trajectory tracking and good control performance is to guarantee the stability and robustness of control system, due to friction forces, external disturbances error, and parameter variations. To deal with this problem, the RBF network is investigated to the joint position control of an n-link robot manipulator. The RBF network is one approach which has shown a great promise in this sort of problems because of its fast learning algorithm and better approximation capabilities. The adaptive RBF network can effectively improve the control performance against large uncertainty of the system. The adaptive turning laws of network parameters are derived using the back-propagation algorithm and the Lyapunov stability theorem, so that the stability of the entire system and the convergence of the weight adaptation are guaranteed. In this control scheme, a robust compensator plays as an auxiliary controller to guarantee the stability and robustness under various environments such as the mass variation, the external disturbances, and modeling uncertainties. Finally, the simulation and experimental results in comparison with adaptive fuzzy and wavelet network control method are provided to verify the effectiveness of the proposed control methodology.",0,1,1
"Naming the pain in requirements engineering
Requirements Engineering (RE) has received much attention in research and practice due to its importance to software project success. Its interdisciplinary nature, the dependency to the customer, and its inherent uncertainty still render the discipline difficult to investigate. This results in a lack of empirical data. These are necessary, however, to demonstrate which practically relevant RE problems exist and to what extent they matter. Motivated by this situation, we initiated the Naming the Pain in Requirements Engineering (NaPiRE) initiative which constitutes a globally distributed, bi-yearly replicated family of surveys on the status quo and problems in practical RE. In this article, we report on the qualitative analysis of data obtained from 228 companies working in 10 countries in various domains and we reveal which contemporary problems practitioners encounter. To this end, we analyse 21 problems derived from the literature with respect to their relevance and criticality in dependency to their context, and we complement this picture with a cause-effect analysis showing the causes and effects surrounding the most critical problems. Our results give us a better understanding of which problems exist and how they manifest themselves in practical environments. Thus, we provide a first step to ground contributions to RE on empirical observations which, until now, were dominated by conventional wisdom only.",1,1,0

"Sufficient and Necessary Conditions for the Identifiability of the Q-matrix
Restricted latent class models (RLCMs) have recently gained prominence in educational assessment, psychiatric evaluation, and medical diagnosis. Different from conventional latent class models, restrictions on RLCM model parameters are imposed by a design matrix to respect practitioners' scientific assumptions. The design matrix, called the $Q$-matrix in cognitive diagnosis literature, is usually constructed by practitioners and domain experts, yet it is subjective and could be misspecified. To address this problem, researchers have proposed to estimate the design $Q$-matrix from the data. On the other hand, the fundamental learnability issue of the $Q$-matrix and model parameters remains underexplored and existing studies often impose stronger than needed or even impractical conditions. This paper proposes the sufficient and necessary conditions for the joint identifiability of the $Q$-matrix and RLCM model parameters. The developed identifiability conditions only depend on the design matrix and therefore is easy to verify in practice.",0,1,1
"Resource Allocation for LEO Beam-Hopping Satellites in a Spectrum Sharing Scenario
In recent years, low earth orbit (LEO) satellite constellation systems have been developed rapidly. However, the scarcity of satellite spectrum resources has become one of the major obstacles to this trend. LEO satellite constellation communication systems sharing the spectrum of incumbent geostationary earth orbit (GEO) satellite system is a feasible way to alleviate spectrum scarcity. Therefore, it has practical significance to study the optimization of satellite resources allocation (RA) in a spectrum sharing scenario. This paper focuses on the RA problem that LEO satellites share a GEO high throughput satellite’s spectrum in a beam-hopping (BH) manner. The GEO satellite system is served as the primary system and the LEO satellite constellation system is served as the secondary system whose frequency bands and transmitting power are strictly limited. Compared with conventional multibeam satellites, BH satellites have the advantage of flexibility in the time dimension. Therefore, we make full use of the flexibility of LEO BH satellites to realize the matching of traffic demand and traffic supply. The RA problem is decomposed into three sub-problems, namely, frequency band selection (FBS) problem, illuminated cell selection (ICS) problem, and transmitting power allocation (TPA) problem. We solve each sub-problem in order and finally form a complete RA scheme. The performance evaluation of the proposed RA scheme is carried out in real-time and simulation results show that the LEO BH satellite paired with the RA scheme we proposed has good adaptability to the uneven distribution of traffic demand in the spectrum sharing scenario.",0,1,0
"Piano Legato-Pedal Onset Detection Based on a Sympathetic Resonance Measure
In this paper, the problem of legato pedalling technique detection in polyphonic piano music is addressed. We propose a novel detection method exploiting the effect of sympathetic resonance which can be enhanced by a legato-pedal onset. To measure the effect, a specific piano transcription was performed using the templates of pre-recorded isolated notes, from which partial frequencies were estimated. This promotes the acquisition of residual components associated to the weak co-excitation of damped notes due to the legato pedalling technique. Features that represent the sympathetic resonance measure were extracted from residuals. We finally used a logistic regression classifier to determine the existence of legato-pedal onsets.",0,0,1
"Minimum time optimal control simulation of a GP2 race car
In this work, optimal control theory is applied to minimum lap time simulation of a GP2 car, using a multibody car model with enhanced load transfer dynamics. The mathematical multibody model is formulated with use of the symbolic algebra software MBSymba and it comprises 14 degrees of freedom, including full chassis motion, suspension travels and wheel spins. The kinematics of the suspension is exhaustively analysed and the impact of tyre longitudinal and lateral forces in determining vehicle trim is demonstrated. An indirect optimal control method is then used to solve the minimum lap time problem. Simulation outcomes are compared with experimental data acquired during a qualifying lap at Montmeló circuit (Barcelona) in the 2012 GP2 season. Results demonstrate the reliability of the model, suggesting it can be used to optimise car settings (such as gearing and aerodynamic setup) before executing track tests.",0,1,1
"Dynamic Metasurface Antennas for 6G Extreme Massive MIMO Communications
Next generation wireless base stations and access points will transmit and receive using an extremely massive numbers of antennas. A promising technology for realizing such massive arrays in a dynamically controllable and scalable manner with reduced cost and power consumption utilizes surfaces of radiating metamaterial elements, known as metasurfaces. To date, metasurfaces are mainly considered in the context of wireless communications as passive reflecting devices, aiding conventional transceivers in shaping the propagation environment. This article presents an alternative application of metasurfaces for wireless communications as active reconfigurable antennas with advanced analog signal processing capabilities for next generation transceivers. We review the main characteristics of metasurfaces used for radiation and reception, and analyze their main advantages as well as their capability to reliably communicate in wireless networks. As current studies unveil only a portion of the potential of metasurfaces, we detail a list of exciting research and implementation challenges which arise from the application of metasurface antennas for wireless transceivers.",0,0,0
"Dynamic Virtual Power Plant: A New Concept for Grid Integration of Renewable Energy Sources
The concept of Virtual Power Plant (VPP) has arisen over a decade ago from the relatively low competitiveness of the back then emerging non-dispatchable RES. A set of smaller generators imitates the behavior of large synchronous generators. So far, static aspects such as generation or slow dynamics have been of interest, as it is the case for the zonal secondary frequency control scheme in Spain, which can be viewed as a VPP. However, considering dynamic aspects is of high importance, especially to further increase the current penetration level of Renewable Energy Sources (RES). Indeed, one should deal with the full participation of RES in grid ancillary services. This means not only to get some positive impact on grid voltage and frequency dynamics but to bring concepts which allow integrating RES to existing secondary regulation schemes on the same level as classic synchronous generators. For that, we propose here a new concept called Dynamic VPP (DVPP) which fully integrates the dynamic aspects at all levels: locally (for each RES generator), globally (for grid ancillary services and interaction with other close-by elements of the grid) and economically (for internal optimal dispatch and participation in electricity markets). A DVPP is a set of dispatchable and non-dispatchable RES along with a set of common control and operation procedures. The latter procedures include the choice of dispatchable and non-dispatchable RES constituting the DVPP, the control of DVPP generators for local objectives and participation of the DVPP as a single unit in ancillary services (especially in case of loss of natural resources - e.g., wind, sun - on a part of the DVPP), the limitation of the risk of adversely interaction with close-by elements and the feasibility in both current power systems scenarios and future ones with large share of RES. This new DVPP framework and approaches developed for its implementation allows ensuring optimal operation of a mixed portfolio of dispatchable and non-dispatchable RES generators for planning, participation to the markets and real-time control. For the control, all time-scale dynamics are considered to improve RES management (internal re-dispatch inside the DVPP to take advantage of dispatchable/non-dispatchable nature of each RES and to optimally manage the lack of natural resources in some regions of the DVPP) and their participation to grid ancillary services. Concrete structures of DVPP as well as ways to address the other control and economical aspects will be shown. This new DVPP concept is now under development in the H2020 POSYTYF project (https://posytyf-h2020.eu/).",1,0,1
"Effect of cutter geometric configuration on aerodynamic noise generation in face milling cutters
Abstract Aerodynamic noise spectrum of rotary face milling cutters consists of a broad range of high frequencies and discrete tones. This paper aims to develop a method to calculate the aerodynamic noise generation and propagation by rotary face milling cutters. The effects of milling cutter geometry on the generation of aerodynamic noise are analyzed. Based on the computational fluid dynamics (CFD) method, the Ffowcs Williams–Hawkings (FW–H) equation is used to predict the sound pressure level (SPL) of aerodynamic noise in face milling cutters. The accurate calculation of time-varying flow variables along with the rotation of cutter is very important for the prediction of aerodynamic noise. In this case, the Navier–Stokes (N–S) equation is employed to evaluate the pressure and velocity fields around the milling cutters, first in a steady mode with the Multiple Reference Frames (MRF) model, and then in an unsteady mode with sliding mesh technique (SMT) by introducing the steady flow variables as its initial fields. It is found that both the overall aerodynamic noise due to the entire cutter and the aerodynamic noise only due to the cutter gullet regions are significantly affected by the number of cutter teeth/gullet regions. Moreover, six representative milling cutters with different tooth numbers and geometries of gullet regions are chosen to study the effects of gullet configuration on aerodynamic noise generation, and the characteristics of noise spectra generated by the cutters are analyzed. The aerodynamic noise generated only by the cutter gullet regions is found to be strongly dependent on the gullet design-volume and shape. The results also reveal that the gullet design advantage of Cutter C in reducing noise generation among the eight-tooth designs, and the gullet design advantage of Cutter A in reducing noise generation among the five and seven-tooth designs in this investigation.",0,1,1
"Robust a posteriori error analysis for rotation-based formulations of the elasticity/poroelasticity coupling
We develop the a posteriori error analysis of three mixed finite element formulations for rotation-based equations in elasticity, poroelasticity, and interfacial elasticity-poroelasticity. The discretisations use H1-conforming finite elements of degree k+1 for displacement and fluid pressure, and discontinuous piecewise polynomials of degree k for rotation vector, total pressure, and elastic pressure. Residual-based estimators are constructed, and upper and lower bounds (up to data oscillations) for all global estimators are rigorously derived. The methods are all robust with respect to the model parameters (in particular, the Lamé constants), they are valid in 2D and 3D, and also for arbitrary polynomial degree k ≥ 0. The error behaviour predicted by the theoretical analysis is then demonstrated numerically on a set of computational examples including different geometries on which we perform adaptive mesh refinement guided by the a posteriori error estimators.",0,1,1
"In-Flight Actuator Failure Recovery of a Hexrotor Via Multiple Models and Extended High-Gain Observers
We study an in-flight actuator failure recovery problem for a hexrotor UAV. The hexrotor may experience external disturbances and modeling error, which are accounted for in the control design and distinguished from an actuator failure. A failure of any one actuator occurs during flight and must be identified quickly and accurately. This is achieved through the use of a multiple-model, multiple extended high-gain observer (EHGO) based output feedback control strategy. The family of EHGOs are responsible for estimating states, disturbances, and are used to select the appropriate model based on the system dynamics after a failure has occurred. The proposed method is theoretically analyzed and validated through simulations and experiments.",1,1,1

"3-D Ultrasonic Fingerprint Sensor-on-a-Chip
A fully integrated 3-D ultrasonic fingerprint sensor-on-a-chip is presented. The device consists of a 110× 56 piezoelectric micromachined ultrasonic transducer (PMUT) array bonded at the wafer level to custom readout electronics fabricated in a 180-nm CMOS process with a HV (24 V) transistor option. With the 24 V driving signal strength, the sensor consumes 280 μJ to image a 4.73 mm × 3.24 mm section of a fingerprint at a rate of 380 fps. A wakeup mode that detects the presence of a finger at 4 fps and dissipates 10 μW allows the proposed sensor to double as a power switch. The sensor is capable of imaging both the surface epidermal and subsurface dermal fingerprints and is insensitive to contaminations, including perspiration or oil. The 3-D imaging capability combined with the sensor's sensitivity to the acoustic properties of the tissue translates into excellent robustness against spoofing attacks.",0,1,1
"Review—""Knees"" in Lithium-Ion Battery Aging Trajectories

 Lithium-ion batteries can last many years but sometimes exhibit rapid, nonlinear degradation that severely limits battery lifetime. Here, we review prior work on “knees” in lithium-ion battery aging trajectories. We first review definitions for knees and three classes of “internal state trajectories” (termed snowball, hidden, and threshold trajectories) that can cause a knee. We then discuss six knee “pathways”, including lithium plating, electrode saturation, resistance growth, electrolyte and additive depletion, percolation-limited connectivity, and mechanical deformation, some of which have internal state trajectories with signals that are electrochemically undetectable. We also identify key design and usage sensitivities for knees. Finally, we discuss challenges and opportunities for knee modeling and prediction. Our findings illustrate the complexity and subtlety of lithium-ion battery degradation and can aid both academic and industrial efforts to improve battery lifetime.",0,0,1

Accordingly, the estimation of blur parameters is more accurate and robust to noise. The experimental results validate the accuracy of the proposed method.",0,0,1
"Differentiable Robotic Manipulation of Deformable Rope-like Objects Using Compliant Position-based Dynamics
Robot manipulation of rope-like objects is an interesting problem that has some critical applications, such as autonomous robotic suturing. Solving for and controlling rope is difficult due to the complexity of rope physics and the challenge of building fast and accurate models of deformable materials. While more data-driven approaches have become more popular for finding controllers that learn to do a single task, there is still a strong motivation for a modelbased method that could be used to solve a large variety of optimization problems. Towards this end, we introduced compliant, position-based dynamics (XPBD) to model rope-like objects. Using geometric constraints, the model can represent the coupling of shear/stretch and bend/twist effects. Of crucial importance is that our formulation is differentiable, which can solve parameter estimation problems and improve the matching of rope physics to real-life scenarios (i.e., the realto-sim problem). For the generality of rope-like objects, two different solvers are proposed to handle the inextensible and extensible effects of varied material stiffness for the rope. We demonstrate our framework’s robustness and accuracy on realto-sim experimental setups using the Baxter robot and the da Vinci research kit (DVRK) [1]. Our work leads to a new path for robotic manipulation of the deformable rope-like object taking advantage of the ready-to-use gradients.",0,1,1
"When Will AI Exceed Human Performance? Evidence from AI Experts

 
 
 
Advances in artificial intelligence (AI) will transform modern life by reshaping transportation, health, science, finance, and the military. To adapt public policy, we need to better anticipate these advances. Here we report the results from a large survey of machine learning researchers on their beliefs about progress in AI. Researchers predict AI will outperform humans in many activities in the next ten years, such as translating languages (by 2024), writing high-school essays (by 2026), driving a truck (by 2027), working in retail (by 2031), writing a bestselling book (by 2049), and working as a surgeon (by 2053).

"Design and Analysis of 6-DOF Triple Scissor Extender Robots With Applications in Aircraft Assembly
A new type of parallel robot mechanism with an extendable structure is presented, and its kinematic properties and design parameters are analyzed. The triple scissor extender (TSE) is a six-degree-of-freedom robotic mechanism for reaching high ceilings and positioning an end effector. Three scissor mechanisms are arranged in parallel, with the bottom ends coupled to linear slides, and the top vertex attached to an end effector plate. Arbitrary positions and orientations of the end effector can be achieved through the coordinated motion of the six linear actuators located at the base. By changing key geometric parameters, the TSE's design can yield a specific desired workspace volume and differential motion behavior. A general kinematic model for diverse TSEs is derived, and the kinematic properties, including workspace, singularity, and the Jacobian singular values, are evaluated. From these expressions, four key design parameters are identified, and their sensitivity upon the workspace volume and the Jacobian singular values is analyzed.A case study in autonomous aircraft assembly is presented using the insights gained from the design parameter studies.",0,1,1
"How to Promote User Purchase in Metaverse? A Systematic Literature Review on Consumer Behavior Research and Virtual Commerce Application Design
Virtual commerce applies immersive technology such as augmented reality and virtual reality into e-commerce to shift consumer perception from 2D product catalogs to 3D immersive virtual spaces. In virtual commerce, the alignment of application design paradigms and the factors influencing consumer behavior is paramount to promote purchase of products and services. The question of their relation needs to be answered, together with the possible improvement of application design. This paper used a systematic literature review approach to synthesize research on virtual commerce from both application design and consumer behavior research, considering the promotion of purchase in virtual commerce settings. Throughout the review, influential factors to purchase and preeminent design artifacts were identified. Then, the research gaps were discovered by mapping the design artifacts to the influential factors, which can inspire future research opportunities on the synergy of these two research directions. Moreover, the evolution of virtual commerce research along with multiple directions were discussed, including the suggestion of meta-commerce as a future trend.",0,0,0

The closed-form expressions derived for the two wireless performance measures are easily evaluated numerically and enable the link designer to examine the effects of system parameters, such as the number of receive antennas, RAKE fingers per antenna, and asynchronous CDMA users in the cell, as well as channel conditions, such as the amount of fading in the combined paths and the multipath intensity profile of the channel on the link performance.

"A Tendon-Driven Robot Gripper With Passively Switchable Underactuated Surface and its Physics Simulation Based Parameter Optimization
In this letter, we propose a single-actuator gripper that can lift thin objects lying on a flat surface, in addition to the ability as a standard parallel gripper. The key is a crawler on the fingertip, which is underactuated together with other finger joints and switched with a passive and spring-loaded mechanism. While the idea of crawling finger is not a new one, this letter contributes to realize the crawling without additional motor. The gripper can passively change the mode from the parallel approach mode to the pull-in mode, then finally to the power grasp mode, according to the grasping state. To optimize the highly underactuated system, we take a combination of black-box optimization and physics simulation of the whole grasp process. We show that this simulation-based approach can effectively consider the pre-contact motion, in-hand manipulation, power grasp stability, and even failure mode, which is difficult for the static-equilibrium-analysis-based approaches.

"Reinforcement Learning based Dynamic Model Selection for Short-Term Load Forecasting
With the growing prevalence of smart grid technology, short-term load forecasting (STLF) becomes particularly important in power system operations. There is a large collection of methods developed for STLF, but selecting a suitable method under varying conditions is still challenging. This paper develops a novel reinforcement learning based dynamic model selection (DMS) method for STLF. A forecasting model pool is first built, including ten state-of-the-art machine learning based forecasting models. Then a Q-learning agent learns the optimal policy of selecting the best forecasting model for the next time step, based on the model performance. The optimal DMS policy is applied to select the best model at each time step with a moving window. Numerical simulations on two-year load and weather data show that the Q-learning algorithm converges fast, resulting in effective and efficient DMS. The developed STLF model with Q-learning based DMS improves the forecasting accuracy by approximately 50%, compared to the state-of-the-art machine learning based STLF models.",0,1,1
"Revisiting Few-sample BERT Fine-tuning
We study the problem of few-sample fine-tuning of BERT contextual representations, and identify three sub-optimal choices in current, broadly adopted practices. First, we observe that the omission of the gradient bias correction in the BERTAdam optimizer results in fine-tuning instability. We also find that parts of the BERT network provide a detrimental starting point for fine-tuning, and simply re-initializing these layers speeds up learning and improves performance. Finally, we study the effect of training time, and observe that commonly used recipes often do not allocate sufficient time for training. In light of these findings, we re-visit recently proposed methods to improve few-sample fine-tuning with BERT and re-evaluate their effectiveness. Generally, we observe a decrease in their relative impact when modifying the fine-tuning process based on our findings.",1,1,0

While social media make it easy to connect with and access information from anyone, they also facilitate basic influence and unfriending mechanisms that may lead to segregated and polarized clusters known as ""echo chambers."" Here we study the conditions in which such echo chambers emerge by introducing a simple model of information sharing in online social networks with the two ingredients of influence and unfriending. Users can change both opinions and social connections based on the information to which they are exposed through sharing. Model dynamics demonstrate that even with minimal amounts of influence and unfriending, the social network rapidly devolves into segregated, homogeneous communities. These predictions are consistent with empirical data from Twitter. Although our findings suggest that echo chambers are somewhat inevitable given the mechanisms at play in online social media, they also provide insights into possible mitigation strategies.",1,1,0
"Hourly-Similarity Based Solar Forecasting Using Multi-Model Machine Learning Blending
With the increasing penetration of solar power into power systems, forecasting becomes critical in power system operations. In this paper, an hourly-similarity (HS) based method is developed for 1-hour-ahead (1HA) global horizontal irradiance (GHI) forecasting. This developed method utilizes diurnal patterns, statistical distinctions between different hours, and hourly similarities in solar data to improve the forecasting accuracy. The HS-based method is built by training multiple two-layer multi-model forecasting framework (MMFF) models independently with the same-hour subsets. The final optimal model is a combination of MMFF models with the best-performed blending algorithm at every hour. At the forecasting stage, the most suitable model is selected to perform the forecasting subtask of a certain hour. The HS-based method is validated by 1-year data with six solar features collected by the National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL). Results show that the HS-based method outperforms the non-HS (all-in-one) method significantly with the same MMFF architecture, wherein the optimal HS-based method outperforms the best all-in-one method by 10.94% and 7.74% based on the normalized mean absolute error and normalized root mean square error, respectively.",0,0,1
"An improved artificial potential field method of trajectory planning and obstacle avoidance for redundant manipulators
In this article, we present an improved artificial potential field method of trajectory planning and obstacle avoidance for redundant manipulators. Specifically, we not only focused on the position for the manipulator end-effectors but also considered their posture in the course of trajectory planning and obstacle avoidance. We introduced boundaries for Cartesian space components to optimize the attractive field function. Moreover, the manipulator achieved a reasonable speed to move to the target pose, regardless of the difference between the initial pose and target pose. We proved the stability using Lyapunov stability theory by introducing velocity feedforward, when the manipulator moved along a continuous trajectory. Considering the shape of the manipulator joints and obstacles, we set up the collision detection model by projecting the obstacles to link coordinates. In this case, establishing the repulsive field between the nearest points on every joint and obstacles with the closest distance was sufficient for achieving obstacle avoidance for redundant manipulators. The simulation results based on a nine-degree-of-freedom hyper-redundant manipulator, which was designed and made in our laboratory, fully substantiated the efficacy and superiority of the proposed method.",0,0,1
"An Overview of a Smart Manufacturing System Readiness Assessment
Smart manufacturing, today, is the ability to continuously maintain and improve performance, with intensive use of information, in response to the changing environments. Technologies for creating smart manufacturing systems or factories are becoming increasingly abundant. Consequently, manufacturers, large and small, need to correctly select and prioritize these technologies correctly.

Knowing this state, users can develop a plan to increase their readiness. Through validation analysis, we show that the assessment has a positive correlation with the operational performance.",0,1,0
"A robust and efficient segregated algorithm for fluid flow: The EPPL method
Abstract An efficient separated method for fluid flows on collocated grid, named EPPL (Error Production and Propagation Limited), has been proposed involving robustness and convergence. The main features of the method include changing the solution procedure according to the matching degree of velocity and pressure dynamically, optimizing the under-relaxation strategy according to the characteristics of momentum interpolation, and enhancing the robustness of pressure equation. In this paper, the basic ideas of the three improvements and the overall solution procedure of the EPPL algorithm are introduced in details. Theoretical support for each improvement is provided by three benchmark compressible/incompressible flow tests, demonstrating the superior performance of the EPPL algorithm. Tests show that the EPPL algorithm achieves significant improvements in both robustness and convergence. In addition, the EPPL algorithm is simple and easy to implement, and the ideas in it are very suitable for porting to existing codes. Finally, the real performance of EPPL for complex case is demonstrated by simulating the interaction of jet and supersonic cross-flow in the background of fuel injection of scramjet.",0,1,1
"DSP implementation of the empirical wavelet transform for measurement of power quality indices
The hardware implementation of Empirical Wavelet Transform (EWT) for the estimation of the IEEE Standard 1459-2000 definitions is presented in this paper. The estimation of single-phase power quality indices (PQIs) using the EWT technique is implemented on a floating point digital signal processor TMS320F28377S. The EWT decomposes the signal into its frequency components adaptively; however, the estimation of PQIs require only the fundamental and non-fundamental components. Therefore, the algorithm aims to extract only the fundamental frequency component accurately by designing an adaptive wavelet filter. The accuracy and practicality of the EWT-based PQIs measurement have been verified by testing on practical signals acquired in the laboratory. Experimental results of the DSP-based PQIs are compared with the results obtained from MATLAB in terms of computational time as well as accuracy.",0,0,1

Therefore, modeling of DLOs as well as a computationally efficient way to predict the DLO behavior are of great importance, in particular to enable robotic manipulation of DLOs. The main motivation of this work is to enable efficient pre- diction of the DLO behavior during robotic manipulation. In this paper, the DLO is modeled by a multivariate dynamic spline, while a symplectic integration method is used to solve the model iteratively by interpolating the DLO shape during the manipulation process. Comparisons between the symplectic, Runge-Kutta and Zhai integrators are reported. The presented results show the capabilities of the symplectic integrator to overcome other integration methods in predicting the DLO behavior. Moreover, the results obtained with different sets of model parameters integrated by means of the symplectic method are reported to show how they influence the DLO behavior estimation.",0,1,1
"Evaluation and Control of Stray Current in DC-Electrified Railway Systems
In urban electric railway transit systems, rails are used to navigate trains, as well as to provide the returning path of the train's electric current to the traction power substation (TPS). Due to electrical resistance of rails and the rail-to-ground conductivity, a part of the train's returning current to the TPS flows into the ground, which is called stray current, which causes different problems such as an increase of rail potential. In this regard, a model of an electric train with a TPS, running rail, and third rail is simulated in MATLAB/Simulink. In the simulated model, the amounts of stray currents in different soil types, with and without collection mats, are compared. Afterward, to calculate the amount of stray current in the presence of the stray current control method considering different soil types through finite–element (FE) method (FEM), a UIC54 rail with insulated fastening equipment is modeled in FEMM 4.2 and analyzed with 2-D FEM. Finally, a comparison of efficiency of stray current collection mats in different soil models for both simulation in MATLAB/Simulink and FEM is also presented. The obtained results verify the accuracy of the simulated and modeled system in real conditions of electric railways.",0,0,1
"Statistical Arbitrage in S&P500
A methodology to create statistical arbitrage in stock Index S&P500 is presented. A synthetic asset based on the cointegration relationship of the stocks with Index was constructed. In order to capture the dynamic of the market time adaptive algorithms have been developed and discussed. The pair trading strategy was applied in different periods between S&P500 and synthetic asset and the results were evaluated. Different metrics have shown that the Multvariate Kalman Algorithm creates statistical arbitrage in index with much lower Maximum Drawdown and higher profit. The algorithm is neutral as the beta is close to zero and the Sharp Ratio remains high in all cases.",0,1,1
"Power system stabilizer based on robust H2 controller
The design of robust H2 power system stabilizer to improve the dynamic performance of the power system is proposed. The effectiveness of the proposed power system stabilizer is validated by a simple power system composed of a synchronous generator connected to an infinite bus-bar through a transmission line. The bounds of power system parameters are determined over a wide range of operating conditions. The results proved the robustness and power of the proposed H2 stabilizer in terms of fast damped response with less settling time. The digital simulation results show that the proposed robust H2 - PSS can achieve good performance over a wide range of operating conditions. Moreover, a comparison between power system responses at variety of operating points using the PSS based on linear quadratic regulator LQR approach and the proposed robust H2-PSS is carried out.",0,0,1
"Deep Convolutional Neural Networks Predict Elasticity Tensors and their Bounds in Homogenization
In the present work, 3D convolutional neural networks (CNNs) are trained to link random heterogeneous, two-phase materials of arbitrary phase fractions to their elastic macroscale stiffness thus replacing explicit homogenization simulations. In order to reduce the uncertainty of the true stiffness of the synthetic composites due to unknown boundary conditions (BCs), the CNNs predict the stiffness for periodic BCs, its upper bound through kinematically uniform BCs, and its lower bound through stress uniform BCs. The workflow of the homogenizationCNN is described, from the microstructure generation over the CNN design, the operations of convolution, nonlinear activation and pooling as well as optimization up to performance measurements in tests. The CNN predictions are very accurate even for microstructure samples of the two-phase diamond-SiC coating material. The CNN that covers all three BCs is virtually as accurate as the separate treatment in three different nets. The CNNs of this contribution provide through stiffness bounds an indicator of the proper RVE size for individual snapshot samples. Moreover, they enable statistical analyses for the effective elastic stiffness on ensembles of synthetical microstructures without costly simulations.",0,1,1
"Optimal Path Planning using RRT* based Approaches: A Survey and Future Directions
Optimal path planning refers to find the collision free, shortest, and smooth route between start and goal positions. This task is essential in many robotic applications such as autonomous car, surveillance operations, agricultural robots, planetary and space exploration missions. Rapidly-exploring Random Tree Star (RRT*) is a renowned sampling based planning approach. It has gained immense popularity due to its support for high dimensional complex problems. A significant body of research has addressed the problem of optimal path planning for mobile robots using RRT* based approaches. However, no updated survey on RRT* based approaches is available. Considering the rapid pace of development in this field, this paper presents a comprehensive review of RRT* based path planning approaches. Current issues relevant to noticeable advancements in the field are investigated and whole discussion is concluded with challenges and future research directions.",0,0,0
"Building Energy Demand Based on Urban Morphology Analysis
This study presents a morphological study to assist in the prediction of energy demand of buildings in the context of a Brazilian city. Different parameters have been applied in the analysis of urban geometry in order to realize a cartography of morphologically homogeneous areas, each one presenting a different influence on the energy demand of buildings. As a first methodological step, the morphological parameters were automated and calculated in a Geographical Information System software, ArcMAP/ArcGIS®. The morphological results obtained for a case study in Maceio, Brazil, were analysed using Principal Components Analysis (PCA), from which it was possible to identify the significance of the parameters to the urban context. Through a Clustering Analysis, different typological configurations were grouped, classified and, then, submitted to computational simulations for energy demand analysis. Six morphological indicators were retained and five representative typological classes of the urban fabric for the Brazilian city were highlighted. A major impact of three main morphological parameters was verified: total built density, verticality, compactness and the mean aspect.",0,0,1
"The Shifting Sands of Motivation: Revisiting What Drives Contributors in Open Source
Open Source Software (OSS) has changed drastically over the last decade, with OSS projects now producing a large ecosystem of popular products, involving industry participation, and providing professional career opportunities. But our field's understanding of what motivates people to contribute to OSS is still fundamentally grounded in studies from the early 2000s. With the changed landscape of OSS, it is very likely that motivations to join OSS have also evolved. Through a survey of 242 OSS contributors, we investigate shifts in motivation from three perspectives: (1) the impact of the new OSS landscape, (2) the impact of individuals' personal growth as they become part of OSS communities, and (3) the impact of differences in individuals' demographics. Our results show that some motivations related to social aspects and reputation increased in frequency and that some intrinsic and internalized motivations, such as learning and intellectual stimulation, are still highly relevant. We also found that contributing to OSS often transforms extrinsic motivations to intrinsic, and that while experienced contributors often shift toward altruism, novices often shift toward career, fun, kinship, and learning. OSS projects can leverage our results to revisit current strategies to attract and retain contributors, and researchers and tool builders can better support the design of new studies and tools to engage and support OSS development.",0,1,0

"Ferroelectric HfO$_2$ Memory Transistors with High-$\kappa$ Interfacial Layer and Write Endurance Exceeding $10^{10}$ Cycles
We demonstrate ferroelectric (FE) memory transistors on a crystalline silicon channel with endurance exceeding 10 cycles. The ferroelectric transistors (FeFETs) incorporate a high-κ interfacial layer (IL) of thermally grown silicon nitride (SiNx) and a thin 4.5 nm layer of Zr-doped FE-HfO2 on a ∼30 nm SOI channel. The device shows a ∼ 1V memory window in a DC sweep of just ± 2.5V, and can be programmed and erased with voltage pulses of VG = ± 3V at a pulse width of 250 ns.

"A Tendon-Driven Robot Gripper With Passively Switchable Underactuated Surface and its Physics Simulation Based Parameter Optimization
In this letter, we propose a single-actuator gripper that can lift thin objects lying on a flat surface, in addition to the ability as a standard parallel gripper. The key is a crawler on the fingertip, which is underactuated together with other finger joints and switched with a passive and spring-loaded mechanism. While the idea of crawling finger is not a new one, this letter contributes to realize the crawling without additional motor. The gripper can passively change the mode from the parallel approach mode to the pull-in mode, then finally to the power grasp mode, according to the grasping state. To optimize the highly underactuated system, we take a combination of black-box optimization and physics simulation of the whole grasp process. We show that this simulation-based approach can effectively consider the pre-contact motion, in-hand manipulation, power grasp stability, and even failure mode, which is difficult for the static-equilibrium-analysis-based approaches. In the last part of the letter, we demonstrate that a prototype gripper with the proposed structure and design parameters optimized under the proposed process successfully power-grasped a thin sheet, a softcover book, and a cylinder lying on a flat surface.",1,1,1
"A Simple Method to Determine Critical Coagulation Concentration from Electrophoretic Mobility
Critical coagulation concentration (CCC) is a key parameter of particle dispersions, since it provides the threshold limit of electrolyte concentrations, above which the dispersions are destabilized due to rapid particle aggregation. A computational method is proposed to predict CCC values using solely electrophoretic mobility data without the need to measure aggregation rates of the particles. The model relies on the DLVO theory; contributions from repulsive double-layer forces and attractive van der Waals forces are included. Comparison between the calculated and previously reported experimental CCC data for the same particles shows that the method performs well in the presence of mono and multivalent electrolytes provided DLVO interparticle forces are dominant. The method is validated for particles of various compositions, shapes, and sizes.",0,0,1
"Impersonation on Social Media: A Deep Neural Approach to Identify Ingenuine Content
Impersonators are playing an important role in the production and propagation of the content on Online Social Networks, notably on Instagram. These entities are nefarious fake accounts that intend to disguise a legitimate account by making similar profiles and then striking social media by fake content, which makes it considerably harder to understand which posts are genuinely produced. In this study, we focus on three important communities with legitimate verified accounts. Among them, we identify a collection of 2.2K impersonator profiles with nearly 10k generated posts, 68K comments, and 90K likes. Then, based on profile characteristics and user behaviours, we cluster them into two collections of ‘bot’ and ‘fan’. In order to separate the impersonator-generated post from genuine content, we propose a Deep Neural Network architecture that measures ‘profiles' and ‘posts' features to predict the content type: ‘bot-generated’, ‘fan-generated’, or ‘genuine’ content. Our study shed light into this interesting phenomena and provides interesting observation on bot-generated content that can help us to understand the role of impersonators in the production of fake content on Instagram.",0,0,0
"What make long term contributors: Willingness and opportunity in OSS community
To survive and succeed, software projects need to attract and retain contributors. We model the individual's chances to become a valuable contributor through her capacity, willingness, and the opportunity to contribute at the time of joining. Using issue tracking data of Mozilla and Gnome, we find that the probability for a new joiner to become a Long Term Contributor (LTC) is associated with her willingness and environment. Specifically, during their first month, future LTCs tend to be more active and show more community-oriented attitude than other joiners. Joiners who start by commenting on instead of reporting an issue or ones who succeed to get at least one reported issue to be fixed, more than double their odds of becoming an LTC. The micro-climate with a productive and clustered peer group increases the odds. On the contrary, the macro-climate with high project popularity and the micro-climate with low attention from peers reduce the odds. This implies that the interaction between individual's attitude and project's climate are associated with the odds that an individual would become a valuable contributor or disengage from the project. Our findings may provide a basis for empirical approaches to design a better community architecture and to improve the experience of contributors.",0,0,0
"System identification of electro-hydraulic actuator system with pressure and load effects
Electro-hydraulic actuator (EHA) system has become one of the most prominent actuator in the past decades. Therefore, it is crucial to attain structural insight into the characteristics of the particular system. This paper presents system identification of EHA system using non-recursive or offline technique where the mathematical model is determined first by considering fixed supply pressure and load. Then, load variation is demonstrated to evaluate the parameter changes. Lastly, supply pressure is changed in order to show the significant effect in the model parameters. The finding shows that the load variation produces insignificant effect in the model parameters due to the limitations of the developed EHA system workbench. However, the supply pressure shows significant effect in the plant model parameters. As conclusion, the robustness and adaptability assessment in the controller design might be appropriately observed in future research works by using the supply variation for the existing EHA system workbench.",0,0,1
"Infrared Dim and Small Target Detection from Complex Scenes via Multi-Frame Spatial-Temporal Patch-Tensor Model
Infrared imaging plays an important role in space-based early warning and anti-missile guidance due to its particular imaging mechanism. However, the signal-to-noise ratio of the infrared image is usually low and the target is moving, which makes most of the existing methods perform inferiorly, especially in very complex scenes. To solve these difficulties, this paper proposes a novel multi-frame spatial–temporal patch-tensor (MFSTPT) model for infrared dim and small target detection from complex scenes. First, the method of simultaneous sampling in spatial and temporal domains is adopted to make full use of the information between multi-frame images, establishing an image-patch tensor model that makes the complex background more in line with the low-rank assumption. Secondly, we propose utilizing the Laplace method to approximate the rank of the tensor, which is more accurate. Third, to suppress strong interference and sparse noise, a prior weighted saliency map is established through a weighted local structure tensor, and different weights are assigned to the target and background. Using an alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) to solve the model, we can accurately separate the background and target components and acquire the detection results. Through qualitative and quantitative analysis, experimental results of multiple real sequences verify the rationality and effectiveness of the proposed algorithm.",0,0,1
"UGV History 101: A Brief History of Unmanned Ground Vehicle (UGV) Development Efforts
Abstract : The purpose of this paper is to provide a brief survey of a number of different threads of development that have brought the Unmanned Ground Vehicle (UGV) field to its current state, together with references to allow the interested reader to probe more deeply. In the broadest ""dictionary"" sense, a UGV is any piece of mechanized equipment that moves across the surface of the ground and serves as a means of carrying or transporting something, but explicitly does NOT carry a human being. A discussion of such a broad universe of possible UGV systems needs some organizing principle, and in fact a taxonomy of UGV systems could be based upon any of a number of characteristics of each system. To reasonably limit its scope, this survey will focus principally on the large number of systems in which the ""long pole"" technological challenge is or has been in the area of navigation and control. Within that context, a teleoperated vehicle system is one in which navigational guidance is transmitted to the vehicle from an externally situated human operator; an autonomous vehicle is one that determines its own course using onboard sensor and processing resources; the term ""supervisory control"" is often given to the myriad of control schemes that combine inputs from both an external human operator and onboard sensors to determine the UGV's path.

"Deep Neural Net with Attention for Multi-channel Multi-touch Attribution
Customers are usually exposed to online digital advertisement channels, such as email marketing, display advertising, paid search engine marketing, along their way to purchase or subscribe products( aka. conversion). The marketers track all the customer journey data and try to measure the effectiveness of each advertising channel. The inference about the influence of each channel plays an important role in budget allocation and inventory pricing decisions. Several simplistic rule-based strategies and data-driven algorithmic strategies have been widely used in marketing field, but they do not address the issues, such as channel interaction, time dependency, user characteristics. In this paper, we propose a novel attribution algorithm based on deep learning to assess the impact of each advertising channel. We present Deep Neural Net With Attention multi-touch attribution model (DNAMTA) model in a supervised learning fashion of predicting if a series of events leads to conversion, and it leads us to have a deep understanding of the dynamic interaction effects between media channels. DNAMTA also incorporates user-context information, such as user demographics and behavior, as control variables to reduce the estimation biases of media effects. We used computational experiment of large real world marketing dataset to demonstrate that our proposed model is superior to existing methods in both conversion prediction and media channel influence evaluation.",0,1,0

"Advanced RDL Interposer PKG Technology for Heterogeneous Integration
As faster data processing and communication gets more demanded for Data Center/Cloud, HPC (High Performance Computing), AI (Artificial Intelligence) accelerator and Network markets, HBM (High Bandwidth Memory) becomes main memory type to meet the required bandwidth performance. HBM integration with logic dies in a system level has been developed on 2.5D SiP (System in Package) Platform with Si Interposer having TSV (Through Silicon Vias) of which fabrication cost is rather high.

"Affine Body Dynamics: Fast, Stable & Intersection-free Simulation of Stiff Materials
Fig. 1. Geared system.We propose an affine body dynamics framework (ABD) to efficiently and robustly simulate close-to-rigid contacting objects. ABD significantly eases the collision and contact processing costs over rigid body modeling while obtaining intersection-free trajectories leveraging barrier-based frictional contact model. Here, in a challenging stress-test benchmark we simulate a complex geared system composed of 28 toothed gears with frictional contact resolving all interactions. The combined gear set mesh is comprised of over 2, 450K surface triangles. A torque applied to the actuated gear (highlighted in red arrow) drives the motion of the entire system via contact, with well over a quarter of all surface elements in active contact in every time step. Here we find that all the existing rigid body simulation algorithms, including rigid-IPC, fail to make progress, while ABD robustly simulates the example to completion. ABD allows large time step sizes (e.g., with Δt = 1/50 sec) even for such complex displacement (rotation) contact processing. For a time step size of 1/100 sec, ABD simulates each step in less than 12 sec on an intel i9 CPU (multi-threaded), while the simulation runs at an interactive rate on a 3090 GPU (5-10 time steps per second).",0,0,1

"Experimental and numerical analysis of BGA lead-free solder joint reliability under board-level drop impact
Board-level solder joint reliability is very critical for handheld electronic products during drop impact. In this study, board-level drop test and finite element method (FEM) are adopted to investigate failure modes and failure mechanisms of lead-free solder joint under drop impact. In order to make all ball grid array (BGA) packages on the same test board subject to the uniform stress and strain level during drop impact, a test board in round shape is designed to conduct drop tests. During these drop tests, the round printed circuit board assembly (PCBA) is suffered from a specified half-sine acceleration pulse. The dynamic responses of the PCBA under drop impact loading are measured by strain gauges and accelerometers. Locations of the failed solder joints and failure modes are examined by the dye penetration test and cross section test. While in simulation, FEM in ABAQUS software is used to study transient dynamic responses. The peeling stress which is considered as the dominant factor affecting the solder joint reliability is used to identify location of the failed solder joints. Simulation results show very good correlation with experiment measurement in terms of acceleration response and strain histories in actual drop test. Solder joint failure mechanisms are analyzed based on observation of cross section of packages and dye and pry as well. Crack occurred at intermetallic composite (IMC) interface on the package side with some brittle features. The position of maximum peeling stress in finite element analysis (FEA) coincides with the crack position in the cross section of a failed package, which validated our FEA. The analysis approach combining experiment with simulation is helpful to understand and improve solder joint reliability.",0,1,1
"In-Hand Manipulation Primitives for a Minimal, Underactuated Gripper With Active Surfaces
Dexterous in-hand manipulation tasks have been difficult to execute, even with highly complex hands and control schemes, as the object grasp stability needs to be maintained while it is displaced in the hand workspace. Researchers have shown that underactuated, adaptive hand designs can effectively immobilize objects with simple, open-loop, but there have been few cases where underactuation has been leveraged to enhance in-hand manipulation. In this work, we investigate the performance of a gripper utilizing a thumb with an active, belt-driven, conveyor surface and an opposing, underactuated finger with passive rollers, for a variety of manipulation tasks and range of objects. We show that consistent, repeatable object motion can be obtained while ensuring a rigid grasp without a priori knowledge of the object geometry or contact locations, due to the adaptive qualities of underactuated design. Many dexterous in-hand manipulation examples with their anthropomorphic equivalents are examined, and simple, open-loop control schemes to optimize the repeatability of these tasks are proposed.Copyright © 2016 by ASME",0,0,1

"Entrepreneurial overconfidence and firm survival: an analysis using the Kauffman firm survey
ABSTRACT We used the Kauffman Firm Survey of ventures founded in the year 2004 to identify overconfident (OC) entrepreneurs and found, contrary to the existing literature, that the hazard ratio for these entrepreneurs was lower than the corresponding value for their non-OC peers. We categorized an entrepreneur as OC if he or she believed that his or her firm enjoys a competitive advantage over its industry peers, while simultaneously underperforming relative to the industry in terms of average initial ROA. Specifically, we looked at the average ROA during the years 2004–2007 and compared it to the industry median. In addition to our hazard findings, we discovered that these OC entrepreneurs, while starting with lower initial ROA levels relative to their industry peers, may have enjoyed slightly better movement in ROA over the intervening years.

"Learning Vehicle Trajectory Uncertainty
The linear Kalman filter is commonly used for vehicle tracking. This filter requires knowledge of the vehicle trajectory and the statistics of the system and measurement models. In real-life scenarios, prior assumptions made while determining those models do not hold. As a consequence, the overall filter performance degrades and in some situations the estimated states diverge. To overcome the uncertainty in the vehicle kinematic trajectory modeling, additional artificial process noise may be added to the model or different types of adaptive filters may be employed. This paper proposes a hybrid adaptive Kalman filter based on model and machine learning algorithms. First, recurrent neural networks are employed to learn the vehicle’s geometrical and kinematic features. In turn, those features are plugged into a supervised learning model, thereby providing the actual process noise covariance to be used in the Kalman framework. The proposed approach is evaluated and compared to six other adaptive filters using the Oxford RobotCar dataset. The proposed framework can be implemented in other estimation problems to accurately determine the process noise covariance in real-time scenarios.",1,1,1
"A Time-Frequency-Based Approach to Phase and Phase Synchrony Estimation
Time-varying phase synchrony is an important bivariate measure that quantifies the dynamics between nonstationary signals and has been widely used in many applications including chaotic oscillators in physics and multichannel electroencephalography recordings in neuroscience. Current state-of-the-art in time-varying phase estimation uses either the Hilbert transform or the complex wavelet transform of the signals. Both of these methods have some major drawbacks such as the assumption that the signals are narrowband for the Hilbert transform and the nonuniform time-frequency resolution inherent to the wavelet analysis. In this paper, a new phase estimation method based on the Rihaczek distribution and Reduced Interference Rihaczek distribution belonging to Cohen's class is proposed. These distributions offer phase estimates with uniformly high time-frequency resolution which can be used for defining time and frequency dependent phase synchrony. Properties of the phase estimator and the corresponding phase synchrony measure are evaluated both analytically and through simulations showing the effectiveness of the new measures compared to existing methods.",0,0,1
"Political Opinions of Us and Them and the Influence of Digital Media Usage
Democracies in the late 2010s are threatened by political movements from the borders of the political spectrum. Right-wing populist parties increasingly find agreement in larger parts of the population. How are these people convinced to these political beliefs? One explanation can be seen in polarization and the phenomena that arise from it such as the spiral of silence. In this article we empirically investigate how digital media usage influences the perception of polarization in Germany using a survey with 179 respondents. We use polarized opinions and measure agreement from two perspectives with them. We find an influence of social media usage on the perception of polarization in our sample. Further, polarization seems to be perceived differently depending on the topic. The results contribute to an understanding of how to adequately design presentation of sensitive or controversial topics in digital social media and could be utilized in student eduction to sensitize social media users to the effect of polarization of opinions.",0,1,0
"Adapting funding processes for agile IT projects: an empirical investigation
Agile software development that provides software development organizations, the ability to respond to changes in turbulent business environments, has been gaining wide adoption. Agile software development projects are characterized by ‘just enough’ planning and lack of upfront commitment to scope, cost, and schedule. These characteristics pose conflicting demands on managers responsible for making funding decisions, because traditional approaches to funding IT projects are often based on well-defined scope, cost, and schedule. These conflicts demand the adaptation of traditional funding processes to suit to agile projects. We draw from Adaptive Structuration Theory to understand the nature of conflicts between traditional IT project funding processes and the dynamic nature of agile projects, and how these conflicts are addressed by practices that are appropriated in the process of social interaction between funding decision makers and development teams. On the basis of a multisite case study, we present a framework that explains how organizations adapt traditional IT funding approaches to accommodate the unique characteristics of agile IT projects.",0,1,0
"100 Unintended consequences of policies to improve the energy efficiency of the UK housing stock
As a major sector contributing to the UK’s greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, housing is an important focus of government policies to mitigate climate change. Current policy promotes the application of a variety of energy efficiency measures to a diverse building stock, which will likely lead to a wide range of unintended consequences. We have undertaken a scoping review identifying more than 100 unintended consequences impacting building fabric, population health and the environment, thus highlighting the urgent need for government and society to reconsider its approach. Many impacts are connected in complex relationships. Some are negative, others possibly co-benefits for other objectives. While there are likely to be unavoidable trade-offs between different domains affected and the emissions reduction policy, a more integrated approach to decision making could ensure co-benefits are optimised, negative impacts reduced and trade-offs are dealt with explicitly. Integrative methods can capture this complexity and support a dynamic understanding of the effects of policies over time, bringing together different kinds of knowledge in an improved decision-making process. We suggest that participatory systems dynamics with multi/inter-disciplinary stakeholders is likely to offer a useful route forward, supporting cross-sectorial policy optimisation that places reducing housing GHG emissions alongside other housing policy goals.",0,0,0

Through a thematic inductive analysis of a subsection of articles, we then investigate how these themes have been defined, used, and linked. This allows us to uncover and problematize the relationships between these themes. In making explicit underlying theoretical assumptions and relationships between knowledge, identity, and power, we induce a unique framework that can guide and support future studies, instigate metaparadigmatic dialogue, and thus help consolidate the field.",0,1,0
"The importance of conflict resolution techniques in autonomous agile teams
Today, software companies usually organize their work in teams. Social science research on team development has shown that for a team to reach a productive and autonomous stage, it has to be able to manage internal conflicts and disagreements efficiently. To better facilitate the team development process, we argue that software engineers needs additional training in negotiation skills and conflict resolution. In this position paper, we outline ideas for what aspects to consider in such training. As an example, we argue that a majority of the conflicts originate from team-level factors and that they, therefore, should be managed on the team-level instead of in relation to dyads.",0,1,0
"Electrical peak demand forecasting- A review
The power system is undergoing rapid evolution with the roll-out of advanced metering infrastructure and local energy applications (e.g. electric vehicles) as well as the increasing penetration of intermittent renewable energy at both transmission and distribution level, which characterizes the peak load demand with stronger randomness and less predictability and therefore poses a threat to the power grid security. Since storing large quantities of electricity to satisfy load demand is neither economically nor environmentally friendly, effective peak demand management strategies and reliable peak load forecast methods become essential for optimizing the power system operations. To this end, this paper provides a timely and comprehensive overview of peak load demand forecast methods in the literature. To our best knowledge, this is the first comprehensive review on such topic. In this paper we first give a precise and unified problem definition of peak load demand forecast. Second, 139 papers on peak load forecast methods were systematically reviewed where methods were classified into different stages based on the timeline. Thirdly, a comparative analysis of peak load forecast methods are summarized and different optimizing methods to improve the forecast performance are discussed. The paper ends with a comprehensive summary of the reviewed papers and a discussion of potential future research directions.",0,0,1
"OFDM Simulation Using Matlab
Orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) is becoming the chosen modulation technique for wireless communications. OFDM can provide large data rates with sufficient robustness to radio channel impairments. Many research centers in the world have specialized teams working in the optimization of OFDM for countless applications. Here, at the Georgia Institute of Technology, one of such teams is in Dr. M. A. Ingram's Smart Antenna Research Laboratory (SARL), a part of the Georgia Center for Advanced Telecommunications Technology (GCATT). The purpose of this report is to provide Matlab code to simulate the basic processing involved in the generation and reception of an OFDM signal in a physical channel and to provide a description of each of the steps involved. For this purpose, we shall use, as an example, one of the proposed OFDM signals of the Digital Video Broadcasting (DVB) standard for the European terrestrial digital television (DTV) service.",0,0,0
"A Nonparametric Asymptotic Analysis of Inventory Planning with Censored Demand
We study stochastic inventory planning with lost sales and instantaneous replenishment where, contrary to the classical inventory theory, knowledge of the demand distribution is not available. Furthermore, we observe only the sales quantity in each period and lost sales are unobservable, that is, demand data are censored. The manager must make an ordering decision in each period based only on historical sales data. Excess inventory is either perishable or carried over to the next period. In this setting, we propose nonparametric adaptive policies that generate ordering decisions over time. We show that the T-period average expected cost of our policy differs from the benchmark newsvendor cost---the minimum expected cost that would have incurred if the manager had known the underlying demand distribution---by at most O(1/T0.5).",0,1,0
"Construction of Design Science Research Questions
© 2019 by the Association for Information Systems. Posing research questions represents a fundamental step to guide and direct how researchers develop knowledge in research. In design science research (DSR), researchers need to pose research questions to define the scope and the modes of inquiry, characterize the artifacts, and communicate the contributions. Despite the importance of research questions, research provides few guidelines on how to construct suitable DSR research questions. We fill this gap by exploring ways of constructing DSR research questions and analyzing the research questions in a sample of 104 DSR publications. We found that about two-thirds of the analyzed DSR publications actually used research questions to link their problem statements to research approaches and that most questions focused on solving problems. Based on our analysis, we derive a typology of DSR question formulation to provide guidelines and patterns that help researchers formulate research questions when conducting their DSR projects.",0,0,0

"AV1 In-loop super-resolution framework
The AV1 codec added a new in-loop super-resolution mode that allows a frame to be encoded at a lower resolution, and then super-resolved normatively to the full resolution, before updating the reference buffers. While encoding at lower resolution and super-resolving to a higher resolution is not a new concept, this is the first time such a mode has been normatively incorporated in a standardized video codec. To this end, AV1 has not only added support for across-scale motion prediction to allow predicting a lower resolution version of a frame from higher resolution reference buffers, but also made various simplifications to the super-resolving process itself after reconstruction to make it both software and hardware-friendly in implementation. Specifically, the super-resolving process in AV1 comprises of normative linear upscaling, followed by a restoration operation to recover the high frequencies using another AV1 tool called loop-restoration that includes a Wiener or Self-guided filter selected in a block switchable manner. Further, in order to enable a cost-effective hardware solution with limited line-buffers, this mode only allows the upscaling/downscaling operation to be horizontal. In this paper, we provide the details of the super-resolution mode in AV1 and some results showcasing the benefits of the same.",0,1,0

"Analysis on One-Stage SSHC Rectifier for Piezoelectric Vibration Energy Harvesting
Conventional SSHI (synchronized switch harvesting on inductor) has been believed to be one of the most efficient interface circuits for piezoelectric vibration energy harvesting systems. It employs an inductor and the resulting RLC loop to synchronously invert the charge across the piezoelectric material to avoid charge and energy loss due to charging its internal capacitor ($C_P$). The performance of the SSHI circuit greatly depends on the inductor and a large inductor is often needed; hence significantly increases the volume of the system. An efficient interface circuit using a synchronous charge inversion technique, named as SSHC, was proposed recently. The SSHC rectifier utilizes capacitors, instead of inductors, to flip the voltage across the harvester. For a one-stage SSHC rectifier, one single intermediate capacitor ($C_T$) is employed to temporarily store charge flowed from $C_P$ and inversely charge $C_P$ to perform the charge inversion. In previous studies, the voltage flip efficiency achieves 1/3 when $C_T = C_P$. This paper presents that the voltage flip efficiency can be further increased to approach 1/2 if $C_T$ is chosen to be much larger than $C_P$.",0,1,1

In this paper, an antenna with polarization reconfigurability is presented. The antenna consists of a two cross-slots diagonally positioned in the centre of a circular patch antenna. Two pair of switches are placed in the slots and by controlling the length of the slots, three different polarizations can be reconfigured. The proposed antenna is capable to reconfigure between linear polarization (LP), right-hand circular polarization (RHCP) and left-hand circular polarization (LHCP). The linear polarization is achieved when the lengths of both slots are equal and the circular polarization type is obtained due to the inequality of the slot length.

"A 12-GHz Calibration-Free All-Digital PLL for FMCW Signal Generation With 78 MHz/μs Chirp Slope and High Chirp Linearity
A novel all-digital phase-locked loop (ADPLL) for fast and high-linear FMCW signal generation is presented in this paper. Fast chirp slope is enabled by two-point modulation (TPM) technique and ramp linearity distortion induced by digitally- controlled oscillator (DCO) is suppressed by wide loop bandwidth. A calibration-free retiming fractional frequency dividing (FFD) scheme based on digital phase interpolator (DPI) is proposed to suppress the <inline-formula> <tex-math notation=""LaTeX"">$\Delta \Sigma $ </tex-math></inline-formula> quantization noise and break the loop bandwidth limitation. A parasitic insensitive DPI is utilized in the retiming FFD scheme to achieve high-linear phase interpolation. A high frequency resolution DCO with 9.8-kHz/bit least significant bit (LSB) and a vernier time-to-digital convertor (TDC) with 2.3-ps time resolution are employed to further minimize the quantization noise. Implemented in 40-nm CMOS, the ADPLL prototype consumes 33.8 mW power and 0.32 mm<sup>2</sup> chip area. Measurement results show that 78 MHz/<inline-formula> <tex-math notation=""LaTeX"">$\mu \text{s}$ </tex-math></inline-formula> maximum chirp slope is achieved with 167 kHz root-mean-square (RMS) frequency error.

"Active tensegrity structures based on dielectric elastomer actuators
Robotic systems based on tensegrity structures have been widely studied in recent years due to their unique characteristics such as lightweight property, deformability, and modularity. These features are originated from the structural configuration of tensegrity that consists of rigid rods connected and stabilized by pre-stretched elastic cables. However, most of the tensegrity robotic systems are driven by electromagnetic motors, which can make their structure bulky and complicated. In this contribution, we present tensegrity structures using dielectric elastomer actuators (DEAs). In these active tensegrity structures, DEAs are used as the elastic cables, allowing them to generate voltage-controlled deformations. Thanks to the multifunctional nature of DEAs, this configuration also enables the sensing of deformations. Given the large actuation strokes and high compliance of DEAs, the DE-tensegrity is expected to become a multifunctional building element for soft robotic systems. In order to prove the concept, we fabricate a DE-tensegrity using an acrylic elastomer (3M, VHB4905) and acrylic (poly(methyl methacrylate)(PMMA)) plate that are used for DEAs and the rigid rods, respectively. A conductive acrylic elastomer is used as the electrodes of DEAs. We characterize the active tensegrity to clarify the actuation and sensing performance and discuss the results.",0,0,1
"Fairness in intellectual property valuation and value-sharing: Towards fair pricing in technology trade and licensing
In today's complex and digital business landscape, innovation is typically not an effort of a lonely genius or an activity confined to a single corporate R&D lab. Instead, the innovation process often involves open innovation, technology trade, and intellectual property (IP) licensing between multiple firms in what is sometimes referred to as an innovation ecosystem. While this interaction is conducive to value creation, it also creates a pressing need for better methods and principles for fairly capturing and sharing value among contributors. The purpose of this paper is to shed light on the plurality and specificity of fairness principles, how they appear in IP negotiation experiments with 105 participants, and what outcomes they generate compared to competitive behavior. The paper especially highlights how investments and the structure of innovation actors, artifacts (such as patents), and activities impact fairness.",0,0,0

Subsequent frame lengths can be adaptively adjusted according to the number of remaining tags.

Compared with the widely used dynamic frame slot ALOHA algorithm – adopted by EPC_C1 G2 standard – tag identification throughput performance increased by 50%.",0,1,0
"Neural network interpretability for forecasting of aggregated renewable generation
With the rapid growth of renewable energy, lots of small photovoltaic (PV) prosumers emerge. Due to the uncertainty of solar power generation, there is a need for aggregated prosumers to predict solar power generation and whether solar power generation will be larger than load. This paper presents two interpretable neural networks to solve the problem: one binary classification neural network and one regression neural network. The neural networks are built using TensorFlow. The global feature importance and local feature contributions are examined by three gradient-based methods: Integrated Gradients, Expected Gradients, and DeepLIFT. Moreover, we detect abnormal cases when predictions might fail by estimating the prediction uncertainty using Bayesian neural networks. Neural networks, which are interpreted by the gradient-based methods and complemented with uncertainty estimation, provide robust and explainable forecasting for decision-makers.",0,1,1

"Optimum Design of an IE4 Line-Start Synchronous Reluctance Motor Considering Manufacturing Process Loss Effect
As a kind of direct-on-line motor, super premium efficiency (IE4) line-start synchronous reluctance motors (LS-SynRMs) were developed recently and are now used in many applications, including fans, pumps, and compressors. This paper presents an optimum design and comparative study of LS-SynRMs with additional losses and impact during the manufacturing process (electrical steel cutting/punching damage as well as squirrel-cage die-casting with bubble effects). The work results indicate that the LS-SynRM design with the “manufacturing process loss” effect should be considered and compensated for the design in order to achieve an IE4 class efficiency and ensure synchronization. Furthermore, the LS-SynRM rotor with multilayer flux barriers and rotor slots is investigated in detail. The influences of optimum design geometrical parameters (flux barriers thickness, segments thickness, length of rotor slots, etc.) on the performances of the basic model and optimum design model are evaluated with finite-element analysis (FEA) results. For more accurate results, the effects of saturation, saliency ratio, inductance difference, and the change in the B-H/B-P curve in damaged motor core edges are considered. Meanwhile, in the squirrel cage, the porosity rate distributions are considered. The copper loss, iron loss, starting torque, power factor, efficiency, and synchronization ability are investigated.

"Monolayer MoS2 Strained to 1.3% With a Microelectromechanical System
We report on a modified transfer technique for atomically thin materials integrated into microelectromechanical systems (MEMS) for studying strain physics and creating strain-based devices. Our method tolerates the non-planar structures and fragility of MEMS while still providing precise positioning and crack-free transfer of flakes. Furthermore, our method used the transfer polymer to anchor the 2D crystal to the MEMS, which reduces the fabrication time and increases the yield, and allowed us to exploit the strong mechanical coupling between the 2D crystal and polymer to strain the atomically thin system. We successfully strained single atomic layers of molybdenum disulfide (MoS2) with MEMS devices for the first time and achieved greater than 1.3% strain, marking a major milestone for incorporating 2D materials with MEMS. We used the established strain response of MoS2 Raman and photoluminescence spectra to deduce the strain in our crystals and provide a consistency check. We found good comparison between our experiment and the literature. [2018-0144]",0,1,1
"The Role of Strategy Workshops in Strategy Development Processes : Formality, Communication, Co-ordination and Inclusion
Strategy workshops, the practice of taking time out from day-to-day routines to deliberate on the longer-term direction of the organisation, are a common practice, yet surprisingly little is known about them. This article presents the first substantial exploration of the role of workshops in strategy development through a large-scale UK survey of managerial experience of these events. The findings, based on 1,337 returns, show that strategy workshops play an important part in formal strategic planning processes; that they rely on discursive rather than analytical approaches to strategy formation; and that they typically do not include middle managers, rather reinforcing elitist approaches to strategy development. The authors conclude that strategy workshops are important vehicles for the emergence of strategy and discuss the implications of their findings for management practice and future research.",0,1,0
"Spatial Pattern Recognition with Adjacency-Clustering: Improved Diagnostics for Semiconductor Wafer Bin Maps
In semiconductor manufacturing, statistical quality control hinges on an effective analysis of wafer bin maps, wherein a key challenge is to detect how defective chips tend to spatially cluster on a wafer--a problem known as spatial pattern recognition. Detecting defect patterns on a wafer can deliver key diagnostics about the root causes of defects and assist production engineers in mitigating future failures. Recently, there has been a growing interest in mixed-type spatial pattern recognition--when multiple defect patterns, of different shapes, co-exist on the same wafer. Mixed-type spatial pattern recognition entails two central tasks: (1) spatial filtering, to distinguish systematic patterns from random noises; and (2) spatial clustering, to group the filtered patterns into distinct defect types. Observing that spatial filtering is instrumental to high-quality pattern recognition, we propose to use a graph-theoretic method called adjacency-clustering, which leverages spatial dependence among adjacent defective chips to effectively filter the raw wafer bin maps. Tested on real-world data and compared against a state-of-the-art approach, our proposed method achieves at least 49% gain in terms of internal cluster validation quality (i.e., validation without external class labels), and about 6% gain in terms of Normalized Mutual Information--an external cluster validation metric based on external class labels. Interestingly, the margin of improvement appears to be a function of the defect pattern complexity, with larger gains achieved for more complex-shaped patterns. This superior performance is a testament to the method's promising impact to semiconductor manufacturing, as well as other contexts where mixed-type spatial patterns are prevalent.",0,0,0
"Robust vehicle routing problem with hard time windows under demand and travel time uncertainty
Abstract Due to an increase in customer-oriented service strategies designed to meet more complex and exacting customer requirements, meeting a scheduled time window has become an important part of designing vehicle routes for logistics activities. However, practically, the uncertainty in travel times and customer demand often means vehicles miss these time windows, increasing service costs and decreasing customer satisfaction. In an effort to find a solution that meets the needs of real-world logistics, we examine the vehicle routing problem with hard time windows under demand and travel time uncertainty. To address the problem, we build a robust optimization model based on novel route-dependent uncertainty sets. However, due to the complex nature of the problem, the robust model is only able to tackle small-sized instances using standard solvers. Therefore, to tackle large instances, we design a two-stage algorithm based on a modified adaptive variable neighborhood search heuristic. The first stage of the algorithm minimizes the total number of vehicle routes, while the second stage minimizes the total travel distance. Extensive computational experiments are conducted with modified versions of Solomon’s benchmark instances. The numerical results show that the proposed two-stage algorithm is able to find optimal solutions for small-sized instances and good-quality robust solutions for large-sized instances with little increase to the total travel distance and/or the number of vehicles used. A detailed analysis of the results also reveals several managerial insights for decision-makers in the logistics industry.",0,0,0
"Parametric study of the dynamic motions and mechanical characteristics of power cables for wave energy converters
A case study of a point-absorber wave energy converter (WEC) system is presented. The WEC system forms an array, with several WECs located around a central hub to which they are each connected by a short, free-hanging power cable. The objective of the study is to analyse the dynamic characteristics and estimate the fatigue life of the power cable which is not yet in use or available on the commercial market. Hence, a novel approach is adopted in the study considering that the power cable’s length is restricted by several factors (e.g., the clearances between the service vessel and seabed and the cable), and the cable is subject to motion and loading from the WEC and to environmental loads from waves and currents (i.e., dynamic cable). The power cable’s characteristics are assessed using a numerical model subjected to a parametric analysis, in which the environmental parameters and the cable’s design parameters are varied. The results of the numerical simulations are compared and discussed regarding the responses of the power cables, including dynamic motion, curvature, cross-sectional forces, and accumulated fatigue damage. The effects of environmental conditions on the long-term mechanical life spans of the power cables are also investigated. Important cable design parameters that result in a long power cable (fatigue) service life are identified, and the cable service life is predicted. This study contributes a methodology for the first-principle design of WEC cables that enables the prediction of cable fatigue life by considering environmental conditions and variations in cable design parameters.",0,0,1

"One-bit compressive sampling with time-varying thresholds: Maximum likelihood and the Cramér-Rao bound
This paper considers the problem of estimating the parameters of a noisy signal which has been quantized to one-bit via a time-varying thresholding operation. An expression for the Fisher information matrix (FIM) is derived for a generic deterministic signal parameterized by a vector β when the noise is independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.) Gaussian with either known or unknown variance. The case of single sinusoidal parameter estimation is considered as a particular example, and the Cramér-Rao bounds (CRB) for amplitude, frequency, and phase estimators are computed for a variety of parameter values. A maximum likelihood (ML) estimator for the sinusoidal signal parameters is proposed, and its performance is compared with the CRB as a function of the number of observations.",0,0,1

"Feature-Level Rating System Using Customer Reviews and Review Votes
This work studies how we can obtain feature-level ratings of the mobile products from the customer reviews and review votes to influence decision-making, both for new customers and manufacturers. Such a rating system gives a more comprehensive picture of the product than what a product-level rating system offers. While product-level ratings are too generic, feature-level ratings are particular; we exactly know what is good or bad about the product. There has always been a need to know which features fall short or are doing well according to the customer’s perception. It keeps both the manufacturer and the customer well-informed in the decisions to make in improving the product and buying, respectively. Different customers are interested in different features. Thus, feature-level ratings can make buying decisions personalized. We analyze the customer reviews collected on an online shopping site (Amazon) about various mobile products and the review votes. Explicitly, we carry out a feature-focused sentiment analysis for this purpose. Eventually, our analysis yields ratings to 108 features for 4000+ mobiles sold online.

"A 3D-PRINTED 1 MG LEGGED MICROROBOT RUNNING AT 15 BODY LENGTHS PER SECOND
This work presents an experimental platform for studying the locomotion of small-scale (<100 mg) legged microrobots. Robot chassis were fabricated with microscale 3D printing and embedded permanent magnets provide actuation. The design integrates a full rotational friction bearing in the hip joint, capable of actuation up to 150 Hz with no visible signs of wear after rotating at 100 Hz for over 1,000,000 cycles. The robot presented in this work weighs 1 mg and is observed running at speeds up to 37.3 mm/s (14.9 body lengths per second) providing initial insights on the dynamics of legged locomotion at ant-scales. INTRODUCTION Empirical biological scaling laws show an increase in relative velocity (body length per second) with decreasing body mass [1]. However, as robots are scaled down, their relative speeds pale in comparison to biological counterparts. An understanding of the dynamics of legged locomotion at insect scales is needed to inform design and control of microrobots. Large-scale robots, such as RHex (7 kg) [2], provide a platform for understanding both the morphology and control of legged locomotion. The large size of RHex enables versatility and flexibility within the platform, allowing design components, such as legs, to be changed easily. By incorporating microscale 3D printing with magnetic actuation, this work provides a versatile platform to study legged locomotion of robots with a mass over 1,000,000 times smaller than RHex. The final robot tested in this work is shown in Figure 1. Making ant-scale microrobotics, specifically robots less than 100 mg in body mass, is an impressive feat in itself. One of the more successful microrobots, an 80 mg thermally actuated microrobot, presented in [3] used thermal actuation to raise and lower legs. However, the stride length and stride frequency of this robot was limited, showing top speeds up to 6 mm/s (0.8 body lengths per second). The 10 mg solar powered microrobot presented in [4] incorporated actuation, control, and power to achieve a robot capable of autonomous movement, although not appreciable forward propulsion. More recently, the walking robot (18 mg) presented in [5] incorporated electrostatic actuators to generate foot paths in vertical and horizontal directions and demonstrated speeds up to 0.7mm/s (0.15 body lengths per second). These same microrobots can serve as physical models for understanding milligram-scale legged locomotion. Legged robots with lead zirconate titanate (PZT) were developed to investigate the dynamics of contact interactions in microrobotic legs [6], with more recent, similarly structured, legged microrobots weighing 4.4 g and 379 mg demonstrating walking at 0.06 body lengths per second and 0.1 body lengths per second, respectively [7]. The 25 mg robot fabricated in [8] incorporated compliant materials to create a microrobot with passively articulated legs. By taking advantage of the passive degrees of freedom and incorporating magnetic actuation this robot achieved top speeds of 5 body lengths per second. Similar to the experimental platform presented in [9], this work takes advantage of 3D printing to create a chassis for a legged robot. By incorporating permanent magnets as a form of wireless actuation the mechanical aspects of legged locomotion can be studied. Additionally, magnetic actuation provides insights into the torque requirements as well as the mechanical power required to achieve motion. Figure 1: Fabricated 1 mg, 2.5 mm x 1.6 mm x 0.7 mm quadrupedal microrobot pictured with a desiccated bullet ant head (Paraponera clavata). ROBOT DESIGN AND FABRICATION The robot design is similar to RHex [2] and the quadrupedal robots presented in [9]. Each leg of the robot is shaped like a “C”, providing a rolling contact with the ground. A friction bearing at each hip enables a full rotary motion of the leg from the torque on an embedded permanent magnet. The microrobots were fabricated using direct laser writing for 3D printing at the microscale. The process is described in Figure 2. A sacrificial layer of 20% dextran (Dextran 70 Sigma-Aldrich) was spin-coated on to an ITO-coated glass slide (Nanoscribe) at 1,500 rpm for 1 minute (Figure 2A). The microrobot structure is patterned using dip-in laser lithography (DiLL) with a Nanoscribe Photonic Professional GT using the 25X objective (Carl Zeiss Microscopy) and a negative tone photoresist (IP-S Nanoscribe). After printing, the microrobots were developed in propylene glycol monomethyl ether acetate (PGMEA) for 2 hours. The slide was removed from the PGMEA bath and rinsed with isopropyl alcohol (IPA) to wash away the PGMEA and excess photoresist. The microrobots were released from the sacrificial layer by dissolving the dextran with deionized (DI) water. The microrobots were then 978-1-940470-03-0/HH2018/$25©2018TRF 59 Solid-State Sensors, Actuators and Microsystems Workshop Hilton Head Island, South Carolina, June 3-7, 2018 DOI 10.31438/trf.hh2018.16 placed in a bath of IPA and sonicated overnight in a heated bath (3510 MTH Branson) to remove any excess photoresist in the rotary joints of the robot. Once fully cleaned, 250 μm cube magnets (C0005-10, SuperMagnetMan) were manually placed in the hip joints and secured with cyanoacrylate (Loctite 401). The final fabricated robot is shown in Figure 1. The orientation of the dipoles of the embedded magnets mechanically programs the gait for the microrobot. In this work, the dipoles were aligned in the same direction, creating a pronking (4-legged hopping) gait. Figure 2: Fabrication process for direct laser writing and embedded permanent magnets for actuation. EXPERIMENTAL SETUP Robots were actuated in a custom-made two-axis Helmholtz coil system, used to generate a two-dimensional rotating magnetic field, providing a torque on the embedded magnets and actuating the legs. A schematic of the interaction is shown in Figure 3. The coil brackets are 3D printed (UPrint Plus SE Stratasys) and wrapped with 22 gauge enameled magnet wire. The vertical coil pair has a nominal diameter of 120 mm and 60 turns of wrapping, while the horizontal pair has a nominal diameter of 160 mm and 50 turns of wrapping. To create a rotating magnetic field, each channel of a 2-channel arbitrary function generator (AFG3022C Tektronix) was connected to a current amplifier (TS200-0A Accel Instruments). The output of each channel of the function generator is set to balance the coils, creating a symmetric rotating field with a magnitude of 0.78 mT. The dipole of the 250 μm cube magnets was estimated from the volume and material of the magnets as 17.8 A-mm. Using the point-dipole model in [10], the maximum applied torque is calculated as",0,0,1
"Modeling and Control of Aggregated Heterogeneous Thermostatically Controlled Loads for Ancillary Services
This paper presents a novel modeling and con- trol approach for the aggregation of large numbers of hetero- geneous thermostatically controlled loads, such as refrigera- tors, electric water heaters, and air conditioners, and their usage for Demand Response. Unlike traditional Demand Re- sponse methods that act on time scales of hours, this ap- proach is able to provide short-term (e.g., second-to-second) ancillary services, such as balancing and frequency control. A statistical modeling approach based on Markov Chains is used to describe the evolution of probability mass in a tem- perature state space. The Markov state transition matrix is identified using state information from the population of thermostatically controlled loads. A predictive controller is used to control the aggregate population of loads such that it tracks a signal. A simulation example shows the applicabil- ity of the approach to realistic systems, and includes a com- parison of control performance depending on available state information and controller parameterization.",0,0,1

"Coverage Path Planning for Robotic Quality Inspection With Control on Measurement Uncertainty
The optical scanning gauges mounted on the robots are commonly used in quality inspection, such as verifying the dimensional specification of sheet structures. Coverage path planning (CPP) significantly influences the accuracy and efficiency of robotic quality inspection. Traditional CPP strategies focus on minimizing the number of viewpoints or traveling distance of robots under the condition of full coverage inspection. The measurement uncertainty when collecting the scanning data is less considered in the free-form surface inspection. To address this problem, a novel CPP method with the optimal viewpoint sampling strategy is proposed to incorporate the measurement uncertainty of key measurement points (MPs) into free-form surface inspection. At first, the feasible ranges of measurement uncertainty are calculated based on the tolerance specifications of the MPs. The initial feasible viewpoint set is generated considering the measurement uncertainty and the visibility of MPs. Then, the inspection cost function is built to evaluate the number of selected viewpoints and the average measurement uncertainty in the field of views of all the selected viewpoints. Afterward, an enhanced rapidly exploring random tree algorithm is proposed for viewpoint sampling using the inspection cost function and CPP optimization. Case studies, including simulation tests and inspection experiments, have been conducted to evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed method. Results show that the scanning precision of key MPs is significantly improved compared with the benchmark method.",0,1,0

"A Conceptual Model for Peer to Peer Energy Trading using Blockchain
Power grids are undergoing significant changes due to rapid growth in renewable energy resources. While these changes enhance sustainability and efficiency, they also create significant management challenges as the complexity of power systems increases. To tackle these challenges, decentralized solutions are emerging, in which local communities are arranged in microgrids. Within the microgrid a prosumer (i.e., consumers with energy generation and consumption capabilities) and the consumer can trade energy with each other without involving any arbitrator, thereby smoothing the load on the main grid. It is very important to design a reliable transaction platform for the energy trading. This paper describes the efficient and reliable model for peer to peer energy trading based on Blockchain. Peer to peer transaction platform build on smart contracts, coupled with blockchain removes the reliance on the central system between transaction parties.

"Energy Efficient Heat Sink Design: Natural Versus Forced Convection Cooling
In highly efficient converter systems, the power consumption of the cooling system (fans) significantly influences the total system efficiency as well as the power density. This paper investigates the potential of free convection cooled heat sinks and compares their performance to forced convection cooled heat sinks on the basis of their volume and power consumption. Underlying theoretical concepts for both types of cooling systems are summarized and their application in an optimization procedure is presented. The theoretical concepts are validated with prototype heat sinks. Finally, at an example of a half-bridge converter, it is shown that by free convection cooling, not only the efficiency but also the power density can be increased. In this case, by paralleling semiconductor devices the losses decrease approximately by a factor of three while simultaneously the heat sink volume can be reduced by approximately 50%.",0,0,1
"The Crowd is a Collaborative Network
The main goal of this paper is to show that crowdworkers collaborate to fulfill technical and social needs left by the platform they work on. That is, crowdworkers are not the independent, autonomous workers they are often assumed to be, but instead work within a social network of other crowdworkers. Crowdworkers collaborate with members of their networks to 1) manage the administrative overhead associated with crowdwork, 2) find lucrative tasks and reputable employers and 3) recreate the social connections and support often associated with brick and mortar-work environments. Our evidence combines ethnography, interviews, survey data and larger scale data analysis from four crowdsourcing platforms, emphasizing the qualitative data from the Amazon Mechanical Turk (MTurk) platform and Microsoft's proprietary crowdsourcing platform, the Universal Human Relevance System (UHRS). This paper draws from an ongoing, longitudinal study of Crowdwork that uses a mixed methods approach to understand the cultural meaning, political implications, and ethical demands of crowdsourcing.",0,0,0
"Trusting Automation: Designing for Responsivity and Resilience.
OBJECTIVE
This paper reviews recent articles related to human trust in automation to guide research and design for increasingly capable automation in complex work environments.


BACKGROUND
Two recent trends-the development of increasingly capable automation and the flattening of organizational hierarchies-suggest a reframing of trust in automation is needed.


METHOD
Many publications related to human trust and human-automation interaction were integrated in this narrative literature review.


RESULTS
Much research has focused on calibrating human trust to promote appropriate reliance on automation. This approach neglects relational aspects of increasingly capable automation and system-level outcomes, such as cooperation and resilience. To address these limitations, we adopt a relational framing of trust based on the decision situation, semiotics, interaction sequence, and strategy. This relational framework stresses that the goal is not to maximize trust, or to even calibrate trust, but to support a process of trusting through automation responsivity.


CONCLUSION
This framing clarifies why future work on trust in automation should consider not just individual characteristics and how automation influences people, but also how people can influence automation and how interdependent interactions affect trusting automation. In these new technological and organizational contexts that shift human operators to co-operators of automation, automation responsivity and the ability to resolve conflicting goals may be more relevant than reliability and reliance for advancing system design.


APPLICATION
A conceptual model comprising four concepts-situation, semiotics, strategy, and sequence-can guide future trust research and design for automation responsivity and more resilient human-automation systems.",0,1,0

"DesignScape: Design with Interactive Layout Suggestions
Creating graphic designs can be challenging for novice users. This paper presents DesignScape, a system which aids the design process by making interactive layout suggestions, i.e., changes in the position, scale, and alignment of elements. The system uses two distinct but complementary types of suggestions: refinement suggestions, which improve the current layout, and brainstorming suggestions, which change the style. We investigate two interfaces for interacting with suggestions. First, we develop a suggestive interface, where suggestions are previewed and can be accepted. Second, we develop an adaptive interface where elements move automatically to improve the layout. We compare both interfaces with a baseline without suggestions, and show that for novice designers, both interfaces produce significantly better layouts, as evaluated by other novices.",0,1,0
"A low-power high-speed comparator for analog to digital converters
A low-power high-speed two-stage dynamic comparator is presented. In this circuit, PMOS transistors are used at the input of the first and second stages of the comparator. At the evaluation phase, the second stage is activated after the first stage with a predetermined delay to achieve a controllable pre-amplifier gain. Also, the first stage is turned off after the delay to reduce overall power consumption. Simulation results in 0.18 μm CMOS technology, prove that the proposed circuit reduces the power consumption by a factor of two and reduces comparison time as large as 210ps in the same budget of offset voltage compared to the conventional circuit. Moreover, the offset voltage and power consumption of the comparator trades with the speed which is simply controlled by the delay of the second stage. As a result, a low-power comparator for given offset and speed requirements can be designed efficiently.",0,0,1
"Impact of IEEE 802.11n/ac PHY/MAC High Throughput Enhancements over Transport/Application Layer Protocols - A Survey
Since the inception of Wireless Local Area Networks (WLANs) in the year 1997, it has tremendously grown in the last few years. IEEE 802.11 is popularly known as WLAN. To provide the last mile wireless broadband connectivity to users, IEEE 802.11 is enriched with IEEE 802.11a, IEEE 802.11b and IEEE 802.11g. More recently, IEEE 802.11n, IEEE 802.11ac and IEEE 802.11ad are introduced with enhancements to the physical (PHY) layer and medium access control (MAC) sublayer to provide much higher data rates and thus these amendments are called High Throughput WLANs (HT-WLANs). For both standards, PHY is enhanced with multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) antenna technologies, channel bonding, short guard intervals (SGI), enhanced modulation and coding schemes (MCS). At the same time, MAC layer overhead is reduced by introducing frame aggregation and block acknowledgement technologies. However, existing studies reveal that although PHY and MAC enhancements promise to improve physical data rate significantly, they yield negative impact over upper layer protocols -- mainly for reliable end-to-end transport/application layer protocols. As a consequence, a large number of schools have focused researches on HT-WLANs to improve the coordination among PHY/MAC and upper layer protocols and thus, boost up the performance benefit. In this survey, we discuss the impact of enhancements of PHY/MAC layer in HT-WLANs over transport/application layer protocols. list down different open challenges that can be explored for the development of next generation HT-WLAN technologies.",0,0,0
"Incentive Mechanism Design for ROI-constrained Auto-bidding
Auto-bidding plays an important role in online advertising and has become a crucial tool for advertisers and advertising platforms to meet their performance objectives and optimize the efficiency of ad delivery. Advertisers employing auto-bidding only need to express high-level goals and constraints, and leave the bid optimization problem to the advertising platforms. As auto-bidding has obviously changed the bidding language and the way advertisers participate in the ad auction, fundamental investigation into mechanism design for auto-bidding environment should be made to study the interaction of auto-bidding with advertisers. In this paper, we formulate the general problem of incentive mechanism design for ROI-constrained auto-bidding, and carry out analysis of strategy-proof requirements for the revenue-maximizing and profit-maximizing advertisers. In addition, we provide a mechanism framework and a practical solution to guarantee the incentive property for different types of advertisers.",0,0,0
"The design space for long-duration energy storage in decarbonized power systems
Long-duration energy storage (LDES) is a potential solution to intermittency in renewable energy generation. In this study we have evaluated the role of LDES in decarbonized electricity systems and identified the cost and efficiency performance necessary for LDES to substantially reduce electricity costs and displace firm low-carbon generation. Our findings show that energy storage capacity cost and discharge efficiency are the most important performance parameters. Charge/discharge capacity cost and charge efficiency play secondary roles. Energy capacity costs must be ≤US$20 kWh–1 to reduce electricity costs by ≥10%. With current electricity demand profiles, energy capacity costs must be ≤US$1 kWh–1 to fully displace all modelled firm low-carbon generation technologies. Electrification of end uses in a northern latitude context makes full displacement of firm generation more challenging and requires performance combinations unlikely to be feasible with known LDES technologies. Finally, LDES systems with the greatest impact on electricity cost and firm generation have storage durations exceeding 100 h. Wind and solar energy must be complemented by a combination of energy storage and firm generating capacity. Here, Sepulveda et al. assess the economic value and system impact of a wide range of possible long-duration energy storage technologies, providing insights to guide innovation and policy.",0,1,1
"INVESTIGATION OF UNSTEADY EFFECTS IN PRESSURE SWIRL ATOMIZERS
Introduction Pressure swirl atomizers are quite common due to their favorable atomization characteristics, low clogging tendency and geometrical simplicity: The fluid to be atomized enters through one, two or more tangential inlet ports, passes through the swirl chamber with a conical convergent part and exits through a cylindrical orifice. The high swirl velocity as well as the acceleration of the liquid through a convergent exit part produce an hollow conical liquid sheet as well as a gaseous core extending from the outlet through the swirl chamber mostly up to the top lid. After some distance downward the nozzle exit, the sheet becomes unstable and breaks up to form a spray of droplets. Although the geometrical characteristics are relatively simple, the inner flow pattern is rather complex. Though several authors tried to gain insight of the internal nozzle flow, there is still distinct lack of knowledge in this regard. Wang [1] and Jeng et al. [2] carried out experimental studies of a swirl atomizers. Jeng et al. [2] also performed a numerical simulation of two−dimensional, turbulent (Baldwin−Lomax model) nozzle model using moving grids for representing the free surface. The nozzle had the same geometry as used at UMIST (Yule,Cooper)[5][6]. The same kind of geometry was used in the references [6], [3], [8] as well. Results were limited to the comparison of nozzle characteristics such as spray angle, film thickness at nozzle exit and discharge coefficient. More recently, Lee and Steinthorsson [8] performed numerical simulations of internal flow in a three−dimensional simplex nozzle and used the same geometry as Jeng [2]. One fourth of the nozzle was simulated using 380,000 control volumes (CVs) and the VOF−method [8]. The resolution they employed was, however, still insufficient for the case treated; clearly, a larger number of cells was necessary. The main problem that remains despite the above contributions is that there seems to be no general agreement even about the nature of the flow fields in a typical simplex nozzle. The present authors have not found any satisfactory definition of characteristic nondimensional reference numbers or expressions that would describe the flow or allow to discriminate between laminar and turbulent flow behavior, much less to decide where the possible transition takes place. H.D. Dahl [9] carried out theoretical and experimental investigations of simplex nozzles. His results are very useful for estimating flow properties for various nozzle geometries. However, due to the small amount of experimental data collected by him, no general conclusions can be drawn about a possible transition zone in the flow. In [4], various characteristic nondimensional numbers for describing the spraying properties of simplex nozzles have been proposed, but again, no evidence about the flow type has been indicated. The major drawback of all the above studies is that they mostly did not consider or investigate the unsteady behavior of the the nozzles and assumed steady flow instead. However, it has been observed repeatedly in experiments and computations that the corresponding flow displays a significant unsteady component. Due to these reasons, it is still difficult to optimize the simplex nozzles without an intimate knowledge of the flow effects occurring in it. With this background in mind, the present authors decided to carry out a detailed phenomenological study of several models of typical pressurized simplex nozzles operated with water or glycerin in air. The present work was accomplished using numerical simulation methods, while still considering the respective experimental results obtained for the same configurations by other investigators [7,6]. The present numerical computations were performed on conventional clusters of PCs using the commercial Navier−Stokes solvers COMET and FLUENT.",0,1,1
"The varying importance of extrinsic factors in the success of startup fundraising: competition at early-stage and networks at growth-stage
We address the issue of the factors driving startup success in raising funds. Using the popular and public startup database Crunchbase, we explicitly take into account two extrinsic characteristics of startups: the competition that the companies face, using similarity measures derived from the Word2Vec algorithm, as well as the position of investors in the investment network, pioneering the use of Graph Neural Networks (GNN), a recent deep learning technique that enables the handling of graphs as such and as a whole. We show that the different stages of fundraising, early- and growth-stage, are associated with different success factors. Our results suggest a marked relevance of startup competition for early stage while growth-stage fundraising is influenced by network features. Both of these factors tend to average out in global models, which could lead to the false impression that startup success in fundraising would mostly if not only be influenced by its intrinsic characteristics, notably those of their founders.",0,0,0
"Shield subway tunnel deformation detection based on mobile laser scanning
Abstract Shield subway tunnels are critical urban infrastructure and precise, rapid deformation detection method is required for the maintenance of these tunnels. A tunnel deformation detection system called Railway Mobile Measurement System (RMMS) was developed based on mobile laser scanning technique. Herein, detailed analysis is given to prove that profiles from the laser scanner can be seen as cross-sections of the tunnel and that the corresponding error can be ignored. A wavelet filtering algorithm was developed to filter the point cloud of tunnel ancillary facilities in the cross-section points. A subsequent ellipse fitting and deformation detection method is proposed. A cross-section location method for subway tunnels is also presented based on the greyscale image converted from the tunnel's point cloud. A tunnel ring segments seams detection method is proposed to detect tunnel ring segments dislocation. The accuracy of the system was verified in a subway tunnel in Wuhan, China with a total station. The accuracy of cross-section measurement was 1.5 mm, the repeatability of the overall and local deformation measurement was 0.5 and 0.9 mm, respectively. This system completely fulfils the accuracy requirement of railway tunnels deformation detection and its efficiency is significantly higher than that of the traditional method.",0,0,1
"On the theoretical foundations of thin solid and liquid shells
This paper gives a concise summary of the general theoretical framework suitable to describe shells with solid-like and liquid-like behavior. Thin-shell kinematics are considered and used to derive the equilibrium equations from linear- and angular-momentum balance. Based on the mechanical power balance and the mechanical dissipation inequality, the constitutive equations for the hyperelastic material behavior of constrained shells are derived and their material stability is examined. Various constitutive examples are considered and assessed for their stability. The governing weak form of the formulation is derived and decomposed into in-plane and out-of-plane components. The presented work provides a very general framework for a unified description of solid and liquid shells and illustrates what leads to their loss of material stability. This framework serves as a basis for developing computational shell formulations based on rotation-free shell discretizations. Therefore the full linearization of the formulation is also presented here.",0,1,1
"A Tendon-Driven Robot Gripper With Passively Switchable Underactuated Surface and its Physics Simulation Based Parameter Optimization
In this letter, we propose a single-actuator gripper that can lift thin objects lying on a flat surface, in addition to the ability as a standard parallel gripper. The key is a crawler on the fingertip, which is underactuated together with other finger joints and switched with a passive and spring-loaded mechanism. While the idea of crawling finger is not a new one, this letter contributes to realize the crawling without additional motor. The gripper can passively change the mode from the parallel approach mode to the pull-in mode, then finally to the power grasp mode, according to the grasping state. To optimize the highly underactuated system, we take a combination of black-box optimization and physics simulation of the whole grasp process. We show that this simulation-based approach can effectively consider the pre-contact motion, in-hand manipulation, power grasp stability, and even failure mode, which is difficult for the static-equilibrium-analysis-based approaches. In the last part of the letter, we demonstrate that a prototype gripper with the proposed structure and design parameters optimized under the proposed process successfully power-grasped a thin sheet, a softcover book, and a cylinder lying on a flat surface.",1,1,1

"Transfer Learning-Based State of Charge Estimation for Lithium-Ion Battery at Varying Ambient Temperatures
Accurate and reliable state of charge (SoC) estimation becomes increasingly important to provide a stable and efficient environment for Lithium-ion batteries (LiBs) powered devices. Most data-driven SoC models are built for a fixed ambient temperature, which neglect the high sensitivity of LiBs to temperature and may cause severe prediction errors. Nevertheless, a systematic evaluation of the impact of temperature on SoC estimation and ways for a prompt adjustment of the estimation model to new temperatures using limited data has been hardly discussed. To solve these challenges, a novel SoC estimation method is proposed by exploiting temporal dynamics of measurements and transferring consistent estimation ability among different temperatures. First, temporal dynamics, which is presented by correlations between the past fluctuation and the future motion, are extracted using canonical variate analysis. Next, two models, including a reference SoC estimation model and an estimation ability monitoring model, are developed with temporal dynamics. The monitoring model provides a path to quantitatively evaluate the influences of temperature on SoC estimation ability. After that, once the inability of the reference SoC estimation model is detected, consistent temporal dynamics between temperatures are selected for transfer learning. Finally, the efficacy of the proposed method is verified through a benchmark. Our proposed method not only reduces prediction errors at fixed temperatures (e.g., reduced by 24.35<inline-formula><tex-math notation=""LaTeX"">$\%$</tex-math></inline-formula> at –20 <inline-formula><tex-math notation=""LaTeX"">$^{\circ }$</tex-math></inline-formula>C, 49.82<inline-formula><tex-math notation=""LaTeX"">$\%$</tex-math></inline-formula> at 25 <inline-formula><tex-math notation=""LaTeX"">$^{\circ }$</tex-math></inline-formula>C) but also improves prediction accuracies at new temperatures.",0,0,1
"Few-Shot Head Swapping in the Wild
The head swapping task aims at flawlessly placing a source head onto a target body, which is of great importance to various entertainment scenarios. While face swapping has drawn much attention, the task of head swapping has rarely been explored, particularly under the few-shot setting. It is inherently challenging due to its unique needs in head modeling and background blending. In this paper, we present the Head Swapper (HeSer), which achieves few-shot head swapping in the wild through two delicately de-signed modules. Firstly, a Head2Head Aligner is devised to holistically migrate pose and expression information from the target to the source head by examining multi-scale in-formation. Secondly, to tackle the challenges of skin color variations and head-background mismatches in the swapping procedure, a Head2Scene Blender is introduced to si-multaneously modify facial skin color and fill mismatched gaps on the background around the head. Particularly, seamless blending is achieved with the help of a Semantic-Guided Color Reference Creation procedure and a Blending UNet. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed method produces superior head swapping results on a variety of scenes.",0,1,1

"A Lagrangian method for constrained dynamics in tensegrity systems with compressible bars
This paper presents a Lagrangian approach to simulating multibody dynamics in a tensegrity framework with an ability to tackle holonomic constraint violations in an energy-preserving scheme. Governing equations are described using non-minimum coordinates to simplify descriptions of the structure’s kinematics. To minimize constraint drift arising from this redundant system, the direct correction method has been employed in conjunction with a novel energy-correcting scheme that treats the total mechanical energy of the system as a supplementary constraint. The formulation has been extended to allow tensegrity structures with compressible bars, allowing for further discussion on potential choices for softer bar materials. The benchmark example involving a common tensegrity structure demonstrates the superiority of the presented formulation over Simscape Multibody in terms of motion accuracy as well as energy conservation. The effectiveness of the energy correction scheme is found to be increasing with the extent of deformations in the structure.",0,0,1

"Reliability of one-shot device with generalized gamma lifetime under cyclic accelerated life-test
One-shot devices are products or equipments that can be used only once. A nature characteristic of one-shot devices is that they get destroyed immediately after their use, and therefore their actual lifetimes are never observable. The only information observed is the condition whether they worked or not at the time they are used. These days the quality of products are significantly improved, so that the information obtained under a normal test during a short time is quite limited. A typical test to induce more failures is the accelerated life-test, which is developed by increasing the stress levels under test. In this paper, we will investigate the reliability of one-shot devices with generalized gamma fatigue life under accelerated life-tests with various cyclic temperature fluctuations by assuming a Norris-Landzberg model. Generalized gamma involves many common lifetime distributions, such as gamma, Weibull, lognormal, and positive stable distributions, as special cases. Norris-Landzberg model takes not only temperature change, highest testing temperature, but also the cycling frequency into account when modeling the number of cycles-to-failure, resulting a generalized model with the well-known Coffin-Manson model and Coffin-Manson-Arrhenius model as special cases. Associated inferences are developed. The performance of the proposed model and inferential methods will be evaluated with simulation study and model discrimination. Finally, the chip-scale package solder joints data is analyzed to illustrate the considered model and inferential methods developed in this paper.",0,1,1

"Data driven indoor air quality prediction in educational facilities based on IoT network
Abstract The approach to the built environment as a container of human activities has been severely outdated with a new vision that puts the user, his/her well-being and his/her experience, at the centre, shifting from the old “building as a product” to the newer “building as a service” and the newest “building as an experience” concept. Nevertheless, the sick building syndrome, mainly documented in office buildings, is a widespread problem in many public buildings and, among these, in educational facilities. In these categories we can list school and university buildings where the users are not only workers but also students, sharing anyway the same problem: an artificial environment which is not supporting their productivity in the office or learning performance in the classrooms. Carbon dioxide concentration, due to the natural human breathing process, is a diffuse parameter strongly influencing the indoor air quality and, thus, the users’ wellbeing. An acceptance threshold of 1000 ppm in indoor spaces has been derived for this pollutant. Although allowed, the CO2 concentration in indoor space shouldn’t reach this threshold because in such a condition a 11-23% reduction of the users’ cognitive performance has been measured and, when the level increases reaching 2500 ppm, the reported drop is dramatic (44- 94%). Extensive researches set the optimal threshold at 600 ppm, a level defined as fresh air. Then, how is it possible to encompass a natural process as CO2 production by humans? Basically with the correct ventilation rate, depending on room geometry, number of people and ventilation system (i.e. natural or mechanical or mixed). A modulating mechanical ventilation system could adapt the ventilation rate according to people density and changing indoor conditions nevertheless many existing buildings have outdated systems not providing this option. Sometimes their air handling units (AHUs) have few regulation options to control the parameters and tuning procedures during the building lifecycle are required. CO2 concentration is convenient to measure indoor air quality because it is easily quantifiable through a sensors network. Thus, it may be adopted as an indicator to assess suitable indoor conditions to human activities and used to trigger manual or automatic procedures to preserve wellbeing thresholds. The article presents a research work depicting the integration of indoor air quality data gathered by internet of things (IoT) sensors to activate the control of the indoor conditions according to the occupancy rate in the educational building eLUX lab, located in the Smart Campus of the University of Brescia. The challenge is to directly regulate the heating, ventilation and air conditioning (HVAC) systems and define opening/closing patterns for windows to improve the indoor air quality and protect the learning performance of users in dynamic use conditions. The embraced methodology suggests the training of an artificial neural network (ANN) with the actual monitored data and to trigger the ventilation rate control through an IoT communication protocol.",0,1,1
"Transmit Beamspace DDMA Based Automotive MIMO Radar
The time division multiple access (TDMA) technique has been applied in automotive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) radar. However, it suffers from the transmit energy loss, and as a result the parameter estimation performance degradation when the number of transmit elements increases. To tackle these problems, a transmit beamspace (TB) Doppler division multiple access (DDMA) approach is proposed. First, a phase modulation matrix with empty Doppler spectrum is introduced. By exploiting the empty Doppler spectrum, a test function based on sequential detection is developed to mitigate the Doppler ambiguity in DDMA waveform. Then, a discrete Fourier transform (DFT)-based TB in slow-time is formed. The proposed method can achieve waveform diversity in Doppler domain and generate a TB in slow-time that concentrates the transmitted power in a fixed spatial region to improve the transmit energy distribution for automotive MIMO radar, which is favored by medium/long range radar (MRR/LRR) applications. As compared to the conventional TDMA technique, the proposed TB DDMA approach can fully exploit the transmission capabilities of all transmit elements to ensure that the emitted power is efficiently used and inherits easy implementation.Moreover, the proposed TB DDMA method avoids the trade-off between the active time for each transmit antenna element and the frame time due to Doppler ambiguity mitigation. Simulation results verify the effectiveness of the proposed TB DDMA approach for automotive MIMO radar.",0,1,0
"OTA: Optimal Transport Assignment for Object Detection
Recent advances in label assignment in object detection mainly seek to independently define positive/negative training samples for each ground-truth (gt) object. In this paper, we innovatively revisit the label assignment from a global perspective and propose to formulate the assigning procedure as an Optimal Transport (OT) problem – a well-studied topic in Optimization Theory. Concretely, we define the unit transportation cost between each demander (anchor) and supplier (gt) pair as the weighted summation of their classification and regression losses. After formulation, finding the best assignment solution is converted to solve the optimal transport plan at minimal transportation costs, which can be solved via Sinkhorn-Knopp Iteration. On COCO, a single FCOS-ResNet-50 detector equipped with Optimal Transport Assignment (OTA) can reach 40.7% mAP under 1× scheduler, outperforming all other existing assigning methods. Extensive experiments conducted on COCO and CrowdHuman further validate the effectiveness of our proposed OTA, especially its superiority in crowd scenarios.

"Speculations Concerning the First Ultraintelligent Machine
Publisher Summary An ultra-intelligent machine is a machine that can far surpass all the intellectual activities of any man however clever. The design of machines is one of these intellectual activities; therefore, an ultra-intelligent machine could design even better machines. To design an ultra-intelligent machine one needs to understand more about the human brain or human thought or both. The physical representation of both meaning and recall, in the human brain, can be to some extent understood in terms of a subassembly theory, this being a modification of Hebb's cell assembly theory. The subassembly theory sheds light on the physical embodiment of memory and meaning, and there can be little doubt that both needs embodiment in an ultra-intelligent machine. The subassembly theory leads to reasonable and interesting explanations of a variety of psychological effects.",0,0,0
"Distributed Power-Generation Systems and Protection
Continuously expanding deployments of distributed power-generation systems (DPGSs) are transforming the conventional centralized power grid into a mixed distributed electrical network. The modern power grid requires flexible energy utilization but presents challenges in the case of a high penetration degree of renewable energy, among which wind and solar photovoltaics are typical sources. The integration level of the DPGS into the grid plays a critical role in developing sustainable and resilient power systems, especially with highly intermittent renewable energy resources. To address the challenging issues and, more importantly, to leverage the energy generation, stringent demands from both utility operators and consumers have been imposed on the DPGS. Furthermore, as the core of energy conversion, numerous power electronic converters employing advanced control techniques have been developed for the DPGS to consolidate the integration. In light of the above, this paper reviews the power-conversion and control technologies used for DPGSs. The impacts of the DPGS on the distributed grid are also examined, and more importantly, strategies for enhancing the connection and protection of the DPGS are discussed.",0,1,1

"Autonomous Charging of Electric Vehicle Fleets to Enhance Renewable Generation Dispatchability
A total 19% of generation capacity in California is offered by PV units and over some months, more than 10% of this energy is curtailed. In this research, a novel approach to reduce renewable generation curtailments and increasing system flexibility by means of electric vehicles’ charging coordination is represented. The presented problem is a sequential decision making process, and is solved by fitted Q-iteration algorithm which unlike other reinforcement learning methods, needs fewer episodes of learning. Three case studies are presented to validate the effectiveness of the proposed approach. These cases include aggregator load following, ramp service and utilization of nondeterministic PV generation. The results suggest that through this framework, EVs successfully learn how to adjust their charging schedule in stochastic scenarios where their trip times, as well as solar power generation are unknown beforehand.",0,1,1
"Maximum Power Point Tracking Algorithms for Photovoltaic System : A Review
PV array has non-linear I-V characteristic and output power depends on environmental conditions such as solar irradiation and temperature. There is a point on I-V, P-V characteristic curve of PV array called as Maximum Power Point (MPP), where the PV system produces its maximum output power. Location of MPP changes with change in environmental condition. The purpose of MPPT is to adjust the solar operating voltage close to MPP under changing environmental conditions. In order to continuously gather the maximum power from the PV array, they have to operate at their MPPT despite of the inhomogeneous change in environmental conditions. The two most commonly algorithms for PV applications as they are easy to implement are Perturb and Observe (P & O) Incremental Conductance (Inc. Con.). A review of various MPPT algorithms is proposed with more focus on above two algorithms.",0,1,1

"A Gibbs sampling algorithm that estimates the Q-matrix for the DINA model
Abstract Cognitive diagnostic assessment has drawn more attention in recent years, which attempts to evaluate whether an examinee has mastered those cognitive skills or attributes being measured in an assessment. To achieve this objective, a variety of cognitive diagnosis models have been developed. The core element of these models is the Q-matrix, which is a binary matrix that establishes item-to-attribute mapping in an exam. Traditionally, the Q-matrix is fixed and designed by domain experts. However, there are concerns that some domain experts might neglect certain attributes, and that different experts could have different opinions. It is therefore of practical importance to develop an automated method for estimating the attribute-to-item mapping, and the purpose of this study is to develop a Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithm to estimate the Q-matrix in a Bayesian framework.",0,0,0
"Affine Body Dynamics: Fast, Stable & Intersection-free Simulation of Stiff Materials
Fig. 1. Geared system.We propose an affine body dynamics framework (ABD) to efficiently and robustly simulate close-to-rigid contacting objects. ABD significantly eases the collision and contact processing costs over rigid body modeling while obtaining intersection-free trajectories leveraging barrier-based frictional contact model. Here, in a challenging stress-test benchmark we simulate a complex geared system composed of 28 toothed gears with frictional contact resolving all interactions. The combined gear set mesh is comprised of over 2, 450K surface triangles. A torque applied to the actuated gear (highlighted in red arrow) drives the motion of the entire system via contact, with well over a quarter of all surface elements in active contact in every time step. Here we find that all the existing rigid body simulation algorithms, including rigid-IPC, fail to make progress, while ABD robustly simulates the example to completion. ABD allows large time step sizes (e.g., with Δt = 1/50 sec) even for such complex displacement (rotation) contact processing. For a time step size of 1/100 sec, ABD simulates each step in less than 12 sec on an intel i9 CPU (multi-threaded), while the simulation runs at an interactive rate on a 3090 GPU (5-10 time steps per second).",0,0,1

"The Automatic Translation of Film Subtitles. A Machine Translation Success Story?
Every so often one hears the complaint that 50 years of research in Machine Translation (MT) has not resulted in much progress, and that current MT systems are still unsatisfactory. A closer look reveals that web-based general-purpose MT systems are used by thousands of users every day. And, on the other hand, special-purpose MT systems have been in long-standing use and work successfully in particular domains or for specific companies. This paper investigates whether the automatic translation of film subtitles can be considered a machine translation success story. We describe various projects on MT of film subtitles and contrast them to our own project in this area. We argue that the text genre ""film subtitles"" is well suited for MT, in particular for Statistical MT. But before we look at the translation of film subtitles let us retrace some other MT success stories. Hutchins (1999) lists a number of successful MT systems. Amongst them is Meteo, a system for translating Canadian weather reports between English and French which is probably the most quoted MT system in practical use. References to Meteo usually remind us that this is a ""highly constrained sublanguage system"". On the other hand there are general purpose but customer-specific MT systems like the English to Spanish MT system at the Pan American Health Organization or the PaTrans system which Hutchins (1999) calls ""... possibly the best known success story for custom-built MT"". PaTrans was developed for LingTech A/S to translate English patents into Danish. Earlier Whitelock and Kilby (1995) (p.198) had called the METAL system ""a success story in the development of MT"".

"A Dynamic Changepoint Model for New Product Sales Forecasting
At the heart of a new product sales-forecasting model for consumer packaged goods is a multiple-event timing process. Even after controlling for the effects of time-varying marketing mix covariates, this timing process is not a stationary one, which means the standard interpurchase time models developed within the marketing literature are not suitable for new products. 
 
In this paper, we develop a dynamic changepoint model that captures the underlying evolution of the buying behavior associated with the new product. This extends the basic changepoint framework, as used by a number of statisticians, by allowing the changepoint process itself to evolve over time. Additionally, this model nests a number of the standard multiple-event timing models considered in the marketing literature. 
 
In our empirical analysis, we show that the dynamic changepoint model accurately tracks and forecasts the total sales curve as well as its trial and repeat components and other managerial diagnostics e.g., percent of triers repeating.",0,0,0

"Studying Product Competition Using Representation Learning
Studying competition and market structure at the product level instead of brand level can provide firms with insights on cannibalization and product line optimization. However, it is computationally challenging to analyze product-level competition for the millions of products available on e-commerce platforms. We introduce Product2Vec, a method based on the representation learning algorithm Word2Vec, to study product-level competition, when the number of products is large. The proposed model takes shopping baskets as inputs and, for every product, generates a low-dimensional embedding that preserves important product information. In order for the product embeddings to be useful for firm strategic decision making, we leverage economic theories and causal inference to propose two modifications to Word2Vec. First of all, we create two measures, complementarity and exchangeability, that allow us to determine whether product pairs are complements or substitutes. Second, we combine these vectors with random utility-based choice models to forecast demand. To accurately estimate price elasticities, i.e., how demand responds to changes in price, we modify Word2Vec by removing the influence of price from the product vectors. We show that, compared with state-of-the-art models, our approach is faster, and can produce more accurate demand forecasts and price elasticities.",0,1,0
"Towards an elastic distributed SDN controller
Distributed controllers have been proposed for Software Defined Networking to address the issues of scalability and reliability that a centralized controller suffers from. One key limitation of the distributed controllers is that the mapping between a switch and a controller is statically configured, which may result in uneven load distribution among the controllers. To address this problem, we propose ElastiCon, an elastic distributed controller architecture in which the controller pool is dynamically grown or shrunk according to traffic conditions and the load is dynamically shifted across controllers. We propose a novel switch migration protocol for enabling such load shifting, which conforms with the Openflow standard. We also build a prototype to demonstrate the efficacy of our design.",0,1,1
"State of Health Estimation System for Lead-Acid Car Batteries Through Cranking Voltage Monitoring
The work in this thesis is focused on the development and validation of an automotive battery monitoring system that estimates the health of a lead-acid battery during engine cranking and provides a low state of health (SOH) warning of potential battery failure. A reliable SOH estimation should assist users in preventing a sudden battery failure and planning for battery replacement in a timely manner. Most commercial battery health estimation systems use the impedance of a battery to estimate the SOH with battery voltage and current; however, using a current sensor increases the installation cost of a system due to parts and labor. The battery SOH estimation method with the battery terminal voltage during engine cranking was previously proposed. The proposed SOH estimation system intends to improve existing methods. The proposed method requires battery voltages and temperature for a reliable SOH estimation. Without the need for a costly current sensor, the proposed SOH monitoring system is cost-effective and useful for automotive applications. Measurement results presented in this thesis show that the proposed SOH monitoring system is more effective in evaluating the health of a lead-acid battery than existing methods. A low power microcontroller equipped prototype implements the proposed SOH algorithm on a high performance ARM Cortex-M4F based MCU, TM4C123GH6PM. The power dissipation of the final prototype is approximately 144 mW during an active state and 36 mW during a sleep state.",0,0,1

"Fault detection in induction motors based on artificial intelligence
Electric motors are essential components in most industrial processes. The various faults in induction machines can result in drastic consequences for an industrial process. The main problems are related to rising costs, worsening conditions in the process, and safety and quality of the final product. Many of these faults appear to be progressive. This work presents a contribution to the study of fault detection methods in electrical motors using Support Vector Machines (SVMs), trained by experimentally obtained vibration signals. The developed methodology is used to classify the excitation resulting from mechanical and electrical faults, in addition to normal operating condition. Through a selection of parameters, it is possible to reduce the number of entries able to represent the signals used for the SVMs training. The SVM procedure was compared with other two artificial intelligence techniques, the Fuzzy Logic (FL) and Artificial Neural Network (ANN). For the FL were created 43 rules and for ANN was evaluated three different architectures. Results showed that SVM has a good generalization, and requires less user knowledge for its application in comparison to FL and ANN.",0,0,1

"Data-driven Energy Management Strategy for Plug-in Hybrid Electric Vehicles with Real-World Trip Information
This paper presents a data-driven supervisory energy management strategy (EMS) for plug-in hybrid electric vehicles which leverages Vehicle-to-Cloud connectivity to increase energy efficiency by learning control policies from completed trips. The proposed EMS consists of two layers, a cloud layer and an on-board layer. The cloud layer has two main tasks: the first task is to learn EMS policy parameters from historical trip data, and the second task is to provide the policy parameters along a certain route requested from the vehicle. The on-board layer receives the learned policy parameters from the cloud layer and computes a real-time solution to the powertrain energy management problem, using a model predictive control scheme. The proposed EMS is evaluated on more than 3000 miles (48 independent driving cycles) of real-world trip data, collected along three commuting routes in California.

"Power Processing Unit Activities at Thales Alenia Space Belgium
Since 1996, Thales Alenia Space Belgium (ETCA) designs, develops and produces Power Processing Unit (PPU) to supply Hall Effect Thrusters. The first qualification model, developed for the 50V bus Stentor program, has supplied during 8900 hours an SPT-100 thruster in a vacuum chamber simulating space environment. Qualified for the 100V Spacebus 4000 platform, the 100V PPU and Filter Unit (FU) EQM have cumulated 6300 hours ground operation with a PPS1350-G thruster. Twenty eight PPU Mk1 flight models were delivered for the Stentor, SES, Smart-1, Intelsat, Inmarsat, Eutelsat, AlphaSat, Yahsat, Direct-TV, Sky Brasil and Amos satellites. In October 2005, the Smart-1 spacecraft reached the Moon after 4958 hours of cumulated operation of the PPU and its PPS1350-G thruster. Sixteen PPU’s currently in flight for North South Station Keeping on eight telecom satellites have cumulated more than 28 800 hours flight operation in May 2015. The PPU Mk1 production continues with seven PPU Mk1 flight models currently ordered. On the SmallGEO platform, one Electric Propulsion Thruster Assembly (EPTA) branch has to drive one out of four SPT-100 thrusters. As the PPU drives one out of two thrusters, TAS-B has developed and qualified an External Thruster Selection Unit (ETSU) to be associated to a PPU. Two flight sets (PPU+ETSU) were delivered for SmallGEO. In order to propose a more competitive product, TAS-B has developed and qualified, for the 100V bus platforms, the PPU Mk2, dedicated to Hall Effect Thrusters up to 2.5kW. The PPU Mk2 EQM was successfully coupled with the SPT-100, PPS1350 at 1.5kW and 2.5kW. PPU Mk2 flight models are under production: eight ordered and four anticipated.

"Control Barrier Functions for Mechanical Systems: Theory and Application to Robotic Grasping
Control barrier functions have been demonstrated to be a useful method of ensuring constraint satisfaction for a wide class of controllers. However, the existing results are mostly restricted to continuous-time systems. Mechanical systems, including robots, are typically second-order systems in which the control occurs at the force/torque level. These systems have actuator, velocity, and position constraints (i.e., relative degree two) that are vital for safety and/or task execution. Additionally, mechanical systems are typically controlled digitally as sampled-data systems. The contribution of this article is twofold. The first contribution is the development of novel, robust control barrier functions that ensure constraint satisfaction for sampled-data systems in the presence of model uncertainty and allows for satisfaction of actuator constraints. The second contribution is the application of the proposed method to the challenging problem of robotic grasping in which a robotic hand must ensure that an object remains inside the grasp while manipulating it to the desired reference trajectory. A grasp constraint satisfying controller is proposed that can admit the existing nominal manipulation controllers from the literature while simultaneously ensuring no slip, no overextension (e.g., singular configurations), and no rolling off of the fingertips. Simulation and experimental results validate the proposed control for the robotic hand application.",1,1,1

"Constraint-based equilibrium and stiffness control of variable stiffness actuators
Considerable research effort has gone into the design of variable passive stiffness actuators (VSAs). A number of different mechanical designs have been proposed, aimed at either a biomorphic (i.e., antagonistic) design, compactness, or simplified modelling and control. In this paper, we propose a (model-based) unified control methodology that is able to exploit the benefits of variable stiffness independent of the specifics of the mechanical design. Our approach is based on forming constraints on commands sent to the VSA to ensure that the equilibrium position and stiffness of the VSA are tracked to the desired values. We outline how our approach can be used for tracking stiffness and equilibrium position both in joint and task space, and how it may be used in the context of constrained local optimal control. In our experiments we illustrate the utility of our approach in the context of online teleoperation, to transfer compliant human behaviour to a variable stiffness device.",0,1,1
"Dynamic Linepack Depletion Models for Natural Gas Pipeline Networks
Given the critical role played by natural gas in providing electricity, heat, and other essential services, better models are needed to understand the dynamics of natural gas networks during extreme events. This paper aims at establishing appropriate simulation models to capture the slow dynamics of linepack depletion for natural gas pipeline networks. Three alternative ordinary differential equation (ODE) simulation techniques are derived and discussed, the first being the conventional one used in the literature. We show that the system of equations associated with this model is degenerate when flux injections are controlled (i.e. specified) at all nodes. The other two present useful frameworks for analyzing how networks respond to system-wide mass flux imbalances. These techniques offer different alternatives for simulating system dynamics based on how sources and loads are chosen to be modeled, and they are all proven to be non-degenerate in a tree-structured network. These proposed techniques are all tested on the 20-node Belgium network. The simulation results show that the conventional model cannot effectively capture linepack depletion under long term system-wide mass flux imbalance, while the proposed models can characterize the network behavior until the linepack is completely depleted.",0,0,1
"An Integrated Interleaved Dual-Mode Time-Sharing Inverter for Single-Phase Grid-Tied Applications
In this paper, a novel integrated interleaved dual-mode time-sharing inverter (IIDMI) is proposed for grid-tied transformerless photovoltaic (PV) applications. While the dual-mode time-sharing conversion technique ensures minimum losses, the IIDMI also retains the advantages of interleaved topologies, such as low total harmonic distortion of the ac current with reduced filtering requirements, increased power density, and reduced current and thermal stresses of power devices. The leakage current problem, which is a main concern with the transformerless PV inverters, is solved by increasing the frequency of the main side band of the common-mode voltage above the resonance frequency of the common-mode impedance, while avoiding high switching losses. The current control, especially at transitions between the buck and the boost modes of operation, is highly improved by utilizing a fast-response deadbeat control scheme. The working principles of the IIDMI are explained in detail, and a 2.2-kW experimental prototype is implemented to confirm the theoretical achievements.",0,1,1
"Analysis for full face mechanical behaviors through spatial deduction model with real-time monitoring data
Mechanical analysis for the full face of tunnel structure is crucial to maintain stability, which is a challenge in classical analytical solutions and data analysis. Along this line, this study aims to develop a spatial deduction model to obtain the full-faced mechanical behaviors through integrating mechanical properties into pure data-driven model. The spatial tunnel structure is divided into many parts and reconstructed in a form of matrix. Then, the external load applied on structure in the field was considered to study the mechanical behaviors of tunnel. Based on the limited observed monitoring data in matrix and mechanical analysis results, a double-driven model was developed to obtain the full-faced information, in which the data-driven model was the dominant one and the mechanical constraint was the secondary one. To verify the presented spatial deduction model, cross-test was conducted through assuming partial monitoring data are unknown and regarding them as testing points. The well agreement between deduction results with actual monitoring results means the proposed model is reasonable. Therefore, it was employed to deduct both the current and historical performance of tunnel full face, which is crucial to prevent structural disasters.",0,0,1

The most important function in a power system planning and operation is the desire to keep the system in a secure state under normal and contingency conditions. Contingency is termed as a disturbance resulting from the components outages. This disturbance is a sudden change in the system configuration resulting in severe violations on the operating constraints. These violations may result in successive interruptions leading to partial or total blackout. The purpose of this paper is to study the effect of power system component outages in terms of their severity to select and rank all severe contingencies, and consequently to apply the Remedial Action Scheme (RAS) approach that is necessary to withstand these contingencies and return the system into a secure state. Both of RAS-1 and RAS-2 strategies are utilized to obtain a final system configuration which successfully recovers from any kind of N-1 contingency criterion. The most economical remedial scheme from RAS-1 and RAS-2 is discriminated. The N-1-1 Contingency Analysis (CA) is performed to investigate the technical robustness of the economically certificated scheme. This work is implemented on IEEE 9 bus system.",0,1,1
"Transient Stability Assessment of Networked Microgrids Using Neural Lyapunov Methods
This paper proposes a novel transient stability assessment tool for networked microgrids based on neural Lyapunov methods. Assessing transient stability is formulated as a problem of estimating the dynamic security region of networked microgrids. We leverage neural networks to learn a local Lyapunov function in the state space. The largest security region is estimated based on the learned neural Lyapunov function, and it is used for characterizing disturbances that the networked microgrids can tolerate. The proposed method is tested and validated in a grid-connected microgrid, three networked microgrids with mixed interface dynamics, and the IEEE 123-node feeder. Case studies suggest that the proposed method can address networked microgrids with heterogeneous interface dynamics, and in comparison with conventional methods that are based on quadratic Lyapunov functions, can characterize the security regions with much less conservativeness.",0,1,1
"Solution of the Forward Problem of Electric Capacitance Tomography of Conductive Materials
A feed-forward neural network is developed for solving the nonlinear forward problem of Electrical Capacitance Tomography (ECT). The ECT system is used in this work to determine the characteristic of the molten metal in lost foam casting (LFC) process. The metal-fill profile is one of the important factors that affect casting quality. The training data are generated by simulating different flow schematics of the molten metal during the casting process. Finite element method is used to generate the training data. Although a large amount of flow patterns and a considerable CPU time are required in the training phase, the trained network is characterized by simplicity and fast response. The nonlinear solution from the neural network can be combined with the Linear Back Projection algorithm to solve the inverse problem and generate the final images. The performance of the technique is compared with commonly used Linear Forward Projection (LFP) using sensitivity matrix, showing superiority in terms of both stability and quality of reconstructed images.",0,1,1
"Anisotropic Two-Dimensional, Plane Strain, and Plane Stress Models in Classical Linear Elasticity and Bond-Based Peridynamics
This paper concerns anisotropic two-dimensional and planar elasticity models within the frameworks of classical linear elasticity and the bond-based peridynamic theory of solid mechanics. We begin by reviewing corresponding models from the classical theory of linear elasticity. This review includes a new elementary and self-contained proof that there are exactly four material symmetry classes of the elasticity tensor in two dimensions. We also summarize classical plane strain and plane stress linear elastic models and explore their connections to the pure two-dimensional linear elastic model, relying on the definitions of the engineering constants. We then provide a novel formulation for pure two-dimensional anisotropic bond-based linear peridynamic models, which accommodates all four material symmetry classes. We further present innovative formulations for peridynamic plane strain and plane stress, which are obtained using direct analogies of the classical planar elasticity assumptions, and we specialize these formulations to a variety of material symmetry classes. The presented anisotropic peridynamic models are constrained by Cauchy's relations, which are an intrinsic property of bond-based peridynamic models. The uniqueness of the presented peridynamic plane strain and plane stress formulations in this work is that we directly reduce three-dimensional models to two-dimensional formulations, as opposed to matching two-dimensional peridynamic models to classical plane strain and plane stress formulations. This results in significant computational savings, while retaining the dynamics of the original three-dimensional bond-based peridynamic problems under suitable assumptions.",0,0,1
"Joint Range and Angle Estimation for FMCW MIMO Radar and Its Application
Recently, frequency-modulated continuous wave (FMCW) radars with array antennas are gaining in popularity on a wide variety of commercial applications. A usual approach of the range and angle estimation of a target with an array FMCW radar is to form a range-angle matrix with deramped receive signal, and then apply the two-dimensional fast Fourier transformation (2D-FFT) on the range-angle matrix. However, such frequency estimation approaches give bias error because two frequencies on the range-angle matrix are not independent to each other, unlike the 2D angle estimation with a passive planar antenna array. We propose a new maximum-likelihood based algorithm for the joint range and angle estimation of multiple targets with an array FMCW radar, and show that the proposed algorithm achieves the Cramer-Rao bounds (CRBs) both for the range and angle estimation. The proposed algorithm is also compared with other algorithms for a simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) problem.",0,1,0
"A Theoretical Extension of the Technology Acceptance Model: Four Longitudinal Field Studies
The present research develops and tests a theoretical extension of the Technology Acceptance Model (TAM) that explains perceived usefulness and usage intentions in terms of social influence and cognitive instrumental processes. The extended model, referred to as TAM2, was tested using longitudinal data collected regarding four different systems at four organizations ( N = 156), two involving voluntary usage and two involving mandatory usage. Model constructs were measured at three points in time at each organization: preimplementation, one month postimplementation, and three months postimplementation. The extended model was strongly supported for all four organizations at all three points of measurement, accounting for 40%--60% of the variance in usefulness perceptions and 34%--52% of the variance in usage intentions. Both social influence processes (subjective norm, voluntariness, and image) and cognitive instrumental processes (job relevance, output quality, result demonstrability, and perceived ease of use) significantly influenced user acceptance. These findings advance theory and contribute to the foundation for future research aimed at improving our understanding of user adoption behavior.",0,1,0
"A neural-network-assisted method for flow-front estimation in resin transfer molding using pressure sensors
The resin transfer molding (RTM) process shows considerable advantages in composite manufacturing. Nevertheless, the part quality manufactured by RTM is sensitive to material and process variations during the preform impregnation. To improve the process robustness and achieve better process control, a methodology for resin flow monitoring based on a combination of a sensing system and a neural network model is proposed, which can be easily implemented into a generic RTM process. Using pressure data provided by a limited number of sensors distributed over the mold surface, the proposed method allows the prediction of flow-front patterns at any impregnation time. The dataset for training is generated by physical-based simulations. Considering the permeability changes caused by uncertainty conditions, the permeability tensor is modeled with random variations. The network parameters are obtained by trial-and-error. Furthermore, the sensor distribution scheme and the dataset size are identified as the sensitive factors of the model. Finally, the predicted results are verified by numerical solutions. This method can be used to avoid the formation of voids and improve the final part quality.",0,1,1
"Hybrid Optimal Theory and Predictive Control for Power Management in Hybrid Electric Vehicle
This paper presents a nonlinear-model based hybrid optimal control technique to compute a suboptimal power-split strategy for power/energy management in a parallel hybrid electric vehicle (PHEV). The power-split strategy is obtained as model predictive control solution to the power management control problem (PMCP) of the PHEV, i.e., to decide upon the power distribution among the internal combustion engine, an electric drive, and other subsystems. A hierarchical control structure of the hybrid vehicle, i.e., supervisory level and local or subsystem level is assumed in this study. The PMCP consists of a dynamical nonlinear model, and a performance index, both of which are formulated for power flows at the supervisory level. The model is described as a bi-modal switched system, consistent with the operating mode of the electric ED. The performance index prescribing the desired behavior penalizes vehicle tracking errors, fuel consumption, and frictional losses, as well as sustaining the battery state of charge (SOC). The power-split strategy is obtained by first creating the embedded optimal control problem (EOCP) from the original bi-modal switched system model with the performance index. Direct collocation is applied to transform the problem into a nonlinear programming problem. A nonlinear predictive control technique (NMPC) in conjunction with a sequential quadratic programming solver is used to compute suboptimal numerical solutions to the PMCP. Methods for approximating the numerical solution to the EOCP with trajectories of the original bi-modal PHEV are also presented in this paper. The usefulness of the approach is illustrated via simulation results on several case studies.",1,1,1

"Why are many businesses instilling a DevOps culture into their organization?
Context DevOps can be defined as a cultural movement to improve and accelerate the delivery of business value by making the collaboration between development and operations effective. Although this movement is relatively recent, there exist an intensive research around DevOps. However, the real reasons why companies move to DevOps and the results they expect to obtain have been paid little attention in real contexts. Objective This paper aims to help practitioners and researchers to better understand the context and the problems that many companies face day to day in their organizations when they try to accelerate software delivery and the main drivers that move these companies to adopting DevOps. Method We conducted an exploratory study by leveraging in depth, semi-structured interviews to relevant stakeholders of 30 multinational software-intensive companies, together with industrial workshops and observations at organizations’ facilities that supported triangulation. Additionally, we conducted an inter-coder agreement analysis, which is not usually addressed in qualitative studies in software engineering, to increase reliability and reduce authors bias of the drawn findings. Results The research explores the problems and expected outcomes that moved companies to adopt DevOps and reveals a set of patterns and anti-patterns about the reasons why companies are instilling a DevOps culture. Conclusions This study aims to strengthen evidence and support practitioners in making better informed about which problems trigger a DevOps transition and most common expected results.",0,0,0
"Suburban Residential Building Penetration Loss at 28 GHz for Fixed Wireless Access
Fixed wireless access at mm/cm bands has been proposed for high-speed broadband access to suburban residential customers and building penetration loss is a key parameter. We report a measurement campaign at 28 GHz in a New Jersey suburban residential neighborhood for three representative single-family homes. A base antenna is mounted at 3-m height, emulating a base station on a lamppost, moves down the street up to 200 m. A customer premises equipment (CPE) device, acting as relay to provide indoor coverage throughout the desired area, is mounted either on the exterior of a street-facing window or 1.5 m behind the window. The median indoor-outdoor path gain difference, corresponding to the extra loss by moving the window-mounted CPE indoor, is found to be 9 dB for the house with low-loss materials and plain-glass windows, and 17 dB for the house with low-emissivity windows and foil-backed insulation. These losses are in addition to other losses (e.g., vegetation blockage) in comparison to free space propagation.",1,1,1

We outline techniques that improve the approach's numerical reliability on embedded hardware with low numerical precision. The efficiency and performance of the approach is experimentally validated on a microcontroller.",0,1,1
"Small Signal Stability Analysis of Multi-Infeed Power Electronic Systems Based on Grid Strength Assessment
The increasing penetration of renewable energy resources, such as wind and solar, is changing AC grid dynamics. Potential dynamic stability issues such as small signal instability may occur when these resources are connected to a grid with low strength, i.e., a weak grid. In this paper, the relationships between small signal stability and grid strength measured with short circuit ratio (SCR), along with the relationships between the stability boundary and critical SCR (CSCR) are analytically studied in a single-infeed power electronic system (SIPES). On this basis, these relationships are extended to a multi-infeed power electronic system (MIPES) through eigenvalue decomposition techniques to define the so-called generalized short circuit ratio (gSCR) and critical gSCR (CgSCR) for small signal stability analysis. The defined gSCR and CgSCR are the generalized representation of SCR and CSCR for SIPESs in MIPESs. The gSCR can assess the grid strength of a MIPES in terms of its small signal stability while the CgSCR can characterize the stability boundary of a MIPES. In addition, the condition of CgSCR = CSCR is satisfied for a MIPES with homogeneous power electronic devices. This enables the proposed method based on the gSCR to simplify the complex stability analysis of MIPESs into the stability study of SIPESs. The efficacy of the proposed gSCR and CgSCR is validated with eigenvalue analysis and time-domain simulations.",0,1,1
"Recent advances in electricity price forecasting: A review of probabilistic forecasting
Since the inception of competitive power markets two decades ago, electricity price forecasting (EPF) has gradually become a fundamental process for energy companies' decision making mechanisms. Over the years, the bulk of research has concerned point predictions. However, the recent introduction of smart grids and renewable integration requirements has had the effect of increasing the uncertainty of future supply, demand and prices. Academics and practitioners alike have come to understand that probabilistic electricity price (and load) forecasting is now more important for energy systems planning and operations than ever before. With this paper we offer a tutorial review of probabilistic EPF and present much needed guidelines for the rigorous use of methods, measures and tests, in line with the paradigm of 'maximizing sharpness subject to reliability'. The paper can be treated as an update and a further extension of the otherwise comprehensive EPF review of Weron (2014, IJF) or as a standalone treatment of a fascinating and underdeveloped topic, that has a much broader reach than EPF itself.",0,0,1
"Trajectory Tracking Control of Autonomous Ground Vehicles Using Adaptive Learning MPC
In this work, an adaptive learning model predictive control (ALMPC) scheme is proposed for the trajectory tracking of perturbed autonomous ground vehicles (AGVs) subject to input constraints. In order to estimate the unknown system parameter, we propose a set-membership-based parameter estimator based on the recursive least-squares (RLS) technique with the ensured nonincreasing estimation error. Then, the estimated system parameter is employed in MPC to improve the prediction accuracy. In the proposed ALMPC scheme, a robustness constraint is introduced into the MPC optimization to handle parametric and additive uncertainties. For the designed robustness constraint, its shape is decided off-line based on the invariant set, whereas its shrinkage rate is updated online according to the estimated upper bound of the estimation error, leading to further reduced conservatism and slightly increased computational complexity compared with the robust MPC methods. Furthermore, it is theoretically shown that the proposed ALMPC algorithm is recursively feasible under some derived conditions, and the closed-loop system is input-to-state stable (ISS). Finally, a numerical example and comparison study are conducted to illustrate the efficacy of the proposed method.",0,1,1

Considering some of our computational results, if we decrease the production costs, then we increase the waste of material of the cutting process and vice versa.

Several tests were performed to check the quality of our approach.",0,1,0
"The varying importance of extrinsic factors in the success of startup fundraising: competition at early-stage and networks at growth-stage
We address the issue of the factors driving startup success in raising funds. Using the popular and public startup database Crunchbase, we explicitly take into account two extrinsic characteristics of startups: the competition that the companies face, using similarity measures derived from the Word2Vec algorithm, as well as the position of investors in the investment network, pioneering the use of Graph Neural Networks (GNN), a recent deep learning technique that enables the handling of graphs as such and as a whole. We show that the different stages of fundraising, early- and growth-stage, are associated with different success factors. Our results suggest a marked relevance of startup competition for early stage while growth-stage fundraising is influenced by network features. Both of these factors tend to average out in global models, which could lead to the false impression that startup success in fundraising would mostly if not only be influenced by its intrinsic characteristics, notably those of their founders.",0,0,0
"Modelling and Characterisation of Flexibility From Distributed Energy Resources
Harnessing flexibility from distributed energy resources (DER) to participate in various markets while accounting for relevant technical and commercial constraints is essential for the development of low-carbon grids. However, there is no clear definition or even description of the salient features of aggregated DER flexibility, including its steady-state and dynamic features and how these are impacted by network constraints and market requirements. This paper proposes a comprehensive DER flexibility modelling and characterisation framework that is based on the concept of nodal operating envelope (NOE). In particular, capacity, ramp, duration and cost are identified as key flexibility metrics and associated with different but consistent NOEs describing capability, feasibility, ramp, duration, economic, technical and commercial flexibility features. These NOEs, which conceptually arise from a Venn diagram, can be built via optimal power flow (OPF) analysis, visualised in the active-reactive power space, and used by different stakeholders. Results from a canonical test system and a real distribution system illustrate the value and applicability of the proposed framework to model and characterise provision of flexibility and market services from DER for different use cases.",1,1,1
"Theory and Practice of Model Risk Management
1 – Why Model Risk Matters Model risk is a topic of great, and growing, interest in the risk management arena. Financial institutions are obviously concerned about the possibility of direct losses arising from mis-marked complex instruments. They are becoming even more concerned, however, about the implications that evidence of model risk mismanagement can have on their reputation, and their perceived ability to control their business. Model risk inhabits, by definition, the opaque area where the value of instruments cannot be fully and directly ascertained in the market. The valuation of these products must be arrived at by means of marking-to-model, and therefore always contain a subjective component. In these days of heightened sensitivity to aggressive or opaque accounting, the ability to rely on sound practices to control model risk can have share-price implications well beyond the monetary value of the mismarked positions. It is also for this reason that financial institutions place increasing importance on the effective management of model risk. Unfortunately, there is a widespread lack of clarity as to what model risk management should achieve, and about which tools should be used for the purpose. In this chapter I intend to answer these questions, to provide theoretical justification for my views and to suggest some practical ways to tackle the problem.",0,1,0
"""FRCEF: The new friction reduced and coupling enhanced finger for the Awiwi hand""
The combination of tendon driven robotic fingers and variable impedance actuation in the DLR hand arm system brings benefits in robustness and dynamics by enabling energy storage. Since the force measurement and motors are in the forearm the tendon path should have low friction for accurate movements and precise finger control. In this paper an enhanced generation of the Awiwi hand finger design is presented. It reduces the friction in the actuation system about 20 percent and increases the maximum fingertip force about 33 percent.

"How to Evaluate Trust in AI-Assisted Decision Making? A Survey of Empirical Methodologies
The spread of AI-embedded systems involved in human decision making makes studying human trust in these systems critical. However, empirically investigating trust is challenging. One reason is the lack of standard protocols to design trust experiments. In this paper, we present a survey of existing methods to empirically investigate trust in AI-assisted decision making and analyse the corpus along the constitutive elements of an experimental protocol. We find that the definition of trust is not commonly integrated in experimental protocols, which can lead to findings that are overclaimed or are hard to interpret and compare across studies. Drawing from empirical practices in social and cognitive studies on human-human trust, we provide practical guidelines to improve the methodology of studying Human-AI trust in decision-making contexts. In addition, we bring forward research opportunities of two types: one focusing on further investigation regarding trust methodologies and the other on factors that impact Human-AI trust.",0,1,0
"Value-Driven use Cases Triage for Embedded Systems: A Case Study of Cellular Phone
A well-defined and prioritized set of use cases enables the enhancement of an entire system by focusing on more important use cases identified in the previous iteration. These use cases are given more opportunities to be refined and tested. Until now, use case prioritization has been done from a user perspective, and through balanced measurement of actors/ objects usage. Lack of cost consideration for realization, however, renders it ineffective for economic purposes. Hence, this study incorporates the ‘value’ concept, based on cost benefit analysis, in use case prioritization for embedded systems. The use case satisfaction level is used as the surrogate for ‘benefit’, and the complexity of implementation for ‘cost’. Based on the value, use cases are prioritized. As a proof-of-concept, we apply our value-based prioritization method to the development of a camera system in a cellular phone.",0,0,0
"Optimal Sensor Placement for Topology Identification in Smart Power Grids
Accurate network topology information is critical for secure operation of smart power distribution systems. Line outages can change the operational topology of a distribution network. As a result, topology identification by detecting outages is an important task to avoid mismatch between the topology that the operator believes is present and the actual topology. Power distribution systems are operated as radial trees and are recently adopting the integration of sensors to monitor the network in real time. In this paper, an optimal sensor placement solution is proposed that enables outage detection through statistical tests based on sensor measurements. Using two types of sensors, node sensors and line sensors, we propose a novel formulation for the optimal sensor placement as a cost optimization problem with binary decision variables, i.e., to place or not place a sensor at each bus/line. The advantage of the proposed placement strategy for outage detection is that it incorporates various types of sensors, is independent of load forecast statistics and is cost effective. Numerical results illustrating the placement solution are presented.",1,0,1

"Enhancement of condensation heat transfer on a microstructured surface with wettability gradient
Abstract Micro- and nanoscale phase-change phenomena are becoming increasingly important for heat transfer owing to the rapid development of microelectromechanical system (MEMS) technology in the fields of microsystems such as in advanced electronics or biomedical devices. In particular, many studies on dropwise condensation have been conducted based on progress of material science for hydrophobic or hydrophilic surfaces. Although majority of these studies achieved high heat transfer performance under low subcooling conditions, the heat transfer coefficient decreased as subcooling increased because of condensate removal limitations. Our previous study using a bi-philic surface with microgrooved structures failed in terms of flooding wherein several patterns were covered by a large liquid film because of poor drainage ability. In microsystems, gravity or vapor shearing forces are ineffective in enhancing droplet departure from the condensing surface as the spaces of the microsystem are limited. Thus, to enhance condensation heat transfer, the flooding and plugging phenomena need to be considered, and therefore, a novel condensing surface needs to be fabricated to remove the growing droplets from the condensing surface. Herein, we introduced a wettability gradient by gradually changing the pattern widths of the hydrophobic and hydrophilic surfaces. The groove width of the hydrophilic part was designed to increase as the condensate flowed downstream. The experiments were conducted under low steam pressure conditions; we found that the size of the droplets could be controlled by modifying the pattern width and the wettability gradient could be used to remove large droplets. The flooding was suppressed, and the heat transfer coefficient was enhanced by three times compared with the results of the microstructured condensing surface with a straight pattern. These results showed that the wettability gradient effectively enhanced condensation heat transfer.",0,0,1
"Contour Moments Based Manipulation of Composite Rigid-Deformable Objects With Finite Time Model Estimation and Shape/Position Control
The robotic manipulation of composite rigid-deformable objects (i.e., those with mixed nonhomogeneous stiffness properties) is a challenging problem with clear practical applications that, despite the recent progress in the field, it has not been sufficiently studied in the literature. To deal with this issue, in this article, we propose a new visual servoing method that has the capability to manipulate this broad class of objects (which varies from soft to rigid) with the same adaptive strategy. To quantify the object’s infinite-dimensional configuration, our new approach computes a compact feedback vector of 2-D contour moments features. A sliding mode control scheme is then designed to simultaneously ensure the finite-time convergence of both the feedback shape error and the model estimation error. The stability of the proposed framework (including the boundedness of all the signals) is rigorously proved with Lyapunov theory. Detailed simulations and experiments are presented to validate the effectiveness of the proposed approach. To the best of the author’s knowledge, this is the first time that contour moments along with finite-time control have been used to solve this difficult manipulation problem.",0,1,1

"The Shifting Sands of Motivation: Revisiting What Drives Contributors in Open Source
Open Source Software (OSS) has changed drastically over the last decade, with OSS projects now producing a large ecosystem of popular products, involving industry participation, and providing professional career opportunities. But our field's understanding of what motivates people to contribute to OSS is still fundamentally grounded in studies from the early 2000s. With the changed landscape of OSS, it is very likely that motivations to join OSS have also evolved. Through a survey of 242 OSS contributors, we investigate shifts in motivation from three perspectives: (1) the impact of the new OSS landscape, (2) the impact of individuals' personal growth as they become part of OSS communities, and (3) the impact of differences in individuals' demographics. Our results show that some motivations related to social aspects and reputation increased in frequency and that some intrinsic and internalized motivations, such as learning and intellectual stimulation, are still highly relevant. We also found that contributing to OSS often transforms extrinsic motivations to intrinsic, and that while experienced contributors often shift toward altruism, novices often shift toward career, fun, kinship, and learning. OSS projects can leverage our results to revisit current strategies to attract and retain contributors, and researchers and tool builders can better support the design of new studies and tools to engage and support OSS development.",0,1,0

"Implementation of a Low- Cost Multi- IMU by Using Information Form of a Steady State Kalman Filter
In this paper, a homogenous multi-sensor fusion method is used to estimate the true angular rate and acceleration with a combination of four low cost (< 10$) MEMS Inertial Measurement Units (IMU). An information form of steady state Kalman filter is designed to fuse the output of four low accuracy sensors to reduce the noise effect by the square root of the number of sensors. A hardware is implemented to test the method with three types of experiments: static test, constant rate, and oscillating test. Results of static test for z-axis show that ARW coefficient reduces to 0.0022°/√s and VRW error is decreased by %50. Also, dynamic test results show the reduction of the standard deviation of combined rate signal up to six times compared with a single sensor. A comparison between the proposed filter and the simple averaging method is made in which the results indicate that the Kalman filter is more accurate compared to the averaging method.

Google's Quick UDP Internet Connections (QUIC) transport layer protocol was developed in 2013 as a successor to its own SPDY networking protocol, which itself led to the formation of the HTTP/2 standard. QUIC's main motives were to take the advantages of TCP/IP and HTTP/2, and build them over UDP, in terms of reliability, flow control, and congestion control. The primary objective of this paper is to explore QUIC functionalities to suggest techniques to improve throughput, speedup and efficiency in wireless networks. The experimental results were established on a local test bed setup connected to a wireless access point in a campus network environment. Experimental results show that QUIC performance in the form of throughput and speedup over TCP/IP in live network environment. The fairness of QUIC in competing flow situations is also examined, and found to perform well in long life traffic. We also propose the reintroduction of FEC for minimization of retransmission latencies.",0,0,0
"Cooperative positioning with multiple robots
A number of positioning identification techniques have been used for mobile robots. Dead reckoning is a popular method, but is not reliable when a robot travels long distances or over an uneven surface because of variations in wheel diameter and wheel slippage. The landmark method, which estimates the current position relative to landmarks, cannot be used in an uncharted environment. The authors propose a new method called ""cooperative positioning with multiple robots"". For cooperative positioning, the authors divide the robots into two groups, A and B. One group, say A, remains stationary and acts as a landmark while group B moves. The moving group B then stops and acts as a landmark for group A. This ""dance"" is repeated until the target robot position are reached. Cooperative positioning has a far lower accumulated positioning error than dead reckoning, and can work in three-dimensions which is not possible with dead reckoning. Also, this method has inherent landmarks and therefore works in uncharted environments. This paper discusses the positioning accuracy of the authors' method with error variances for an example with three mobile robots.<<ETX>>",0,1,0
"Large-Scale Benchmarks for the Job Shop Scheduling Problem
The aim of this report is to present and provide access to two novel benchmarks for the Job Shop Scheduling Problem (JSSP). The JSSP is one of the most studied scheduling problem and as such, there are a large number of benchmarks available in literature (e.g. [10, 13, 1, 12, 2]). However, a common shortcoming of classic problem instances is the limited number of jobs and operations in comparison with real industrial scenarios. The industrial field is one of the domains that had more impact in the development of scheduling theory [11, 4, 3], to the point that even the terminology adopted by scholars derives from its semantic field. In fact, terms often used in the scheduling domain are strictly coupled with industrial concepts, like machines to indicate resources and jobs to indicate tasks. Following this terminology, the factory layout (i.e. the number of machines and their functionality) is called shop, and when a job is composed by sub-tasks ordered in a specific sequence, they are called operations. Operations are linked to machines with the concept of operation type. In fact, every operation has a type and each machine can process operations of certain types, and not others. Despite this strong link, scholars have begun to study the scheduling problem in a more abstract and “pure” form. This allowed researchers to concentrate on the aspects that are at the core of the problem complexity (e.g. [8]), but made more and more difficult to apply the academic results on real-life scenarios [7]. One of the aspects where this discrepancy is more visible is the size of the scheduling problems.In fact, one of the few benchmark targeted to industrial scenarios is the Taillard benchmark, from 1992 [13]. He published a benchmark simulating the size of real industrial data, with the largest JSSP instances reaching 100 jobs to be scheduled on 20 machines. After his work, however, little effort was put into maintaining the parallelism between real industrial problems and JSSP instances. Nowadays it is not uncommon to reach scheduling problems as big as 1000 jobs on 1000 machines for a rather short planning horizon (e.g. a week); however, in JSSP there are no benchmarks of such size. Some recent studies, like Zhai et al. in 2014 [16], address the problem, but are still reluctant to test instances beyond 100 jobs on 50 machines. Others, like one",0,1,0
"A Flexible Harmonic Control Approach Through Voltage-Controlled DG–Grid Interfacing Converters
The increased penetration of nonlinear loads and power-electronics-based distributed generation (DG) systems may introduce power quality issues to the distribution power system. However, if controlled and regulated properly, the DG-grid interfacing converters are able to improve the distribution system efficiency and power quality. This paper focuses on the distribution system harmonic control through the DG-grid interfacing converters. Two alternative DG systems, namely, current-controlled DG and voltage-controlled DG, are considered. While most of the previous works on harmonic compensation are based on the current-controlled method, a novel harmonic control scheme using a voltage-controlled method is developed in this paper. The voltage-controlled method is more flexible and has similar compensation performance compared to the conventional current-controlled method. In addition, by avoiding the implementation of a harmonic current tracking loop, the proposed voltage-based method can be seamlessly incorporated into a voltage-controlled DG unit, which is important to provide direct voltage and frequency support in a microgrid. Moreover, the possible harmonic circulating current among multiple DG systems is also investigated in this paper. Simulations and experimental results from a three-phase 5-kVA laboratory DG prototype are provided to validate the discussion.",0,1,1
"Verification of Safe Operating Area ( SOA ) Constraints in Analog Circuits
The modeling, simulation and their effects of aging (e.g. negative bias temperature instability (NBTI), hot carrier stress (HC)) have been a topic of research for nearly two decades. These reliability models and corresponding simulation techniques are not yet widely available in current process development kits (PDK) and design flows. In general, process documentation contains information about safe operating areas (SOA) such as maximum current and voltage stress of the devices. How this information can be used with current tools for design, verification and optimization today is presented in this paper.",0,0,1
"Association Between Logical Reasoning Ability and Quality of Relevance Judgments in Crowdsourcing
Human assessors are in charge of creating relevance judgments set in a typical test collection. Nevertheless, this approach is not that efficient as it is expensive and time consuming while scales deficiently. Crowdsourcing as a recent technique for data acquisition is a low-cost and fast method for building relevance judgments. One of the most important issues for using crowdsourcing instead of human expert assessors is the quality of crowdsourcing in building relevance judgments. In order to assess this issue, factors that may have significant effects on the quality of crowdsourcing relevance judgments should be identified. The main objective of this study is to find out whether cognitive characteristics of crowdsourced workers significantly associated with quality of crowdsourced judgments, and to evaluate the effect(s) that each of those characteristics may have on judgment quality, as compared with the gold standard dataset (i.e. human assessment). Thus, the judgments of the crowdsourced workers is compared to that of a human judgment, as the overlap between relevance assessments, and by comparing the system effectiveness evaluation provided by human judgment and from worker assessors. In this study, we assess the effects of the cognitive ability namely logical reasoning ability on quality of relevance judgment. The experiment shows that logical reasoning ability of individuals is remarkably correlated with quality of relevance judgments.",0,1,0

Recently, PSA technology has been applied in other areas like methane purification from natural and biogas and has a tremendous potential to expand its utilization. It is known that the adsorbent material employed in a PSA process is extremely important in defining its properties, but it has also been demonstrated that process engineering can improve the performance of PSA units significantly. This paper aims to provide an overview of the fundamentals of PSA process while focusing specifically on different innovative engineering approaches that contributed to continuous improvement of PSA performance.",0,1,1
"Which Factors Impact Engagement on News Articles on Facebook?
Social media is increasingly being used as a news-platform. To reach their intended audience, newspapers need for their articles to be well ranked by Facebook's news-feed algorithm. The number of likes, shares and other reactions determine the lead scoring criteria. This paper will try to assess how the reaction volume is impacted by the following criteria: (1) Delay between event and post release; (2) Time of the day the post is published; and (3) Post format: video, photo or text. To isolate the effect of the publication time and post format on a post, we need to control for the news-event and the publishing newspaper. For that end, a news-aggregator is designed and implemented, to group together posts that relate to the same news-event. This tool gave some spin-off results, allowing the ability to map newspapers by similarity and to detect some topic omissions.",0,0,0
"A multiscale molecular dynamics approach to contact mechanics.
The friction and adhesion between elastic bodies are strongly influenced by the roughness of the surfaces in contact. Here we develop a multiscale molecular dynamics approach to contact mechanics, which can be used also when the surfaces have roughness on many different length-scales, e.g., for self affine fractal surfaces. As an illustration we consider the contact between randomly rough surfaces, and show that the contact area varies linearly with the load for small load. We also analyze the contact morphology and the pressure distribution at different magnification, both with and without adhesion. The calculations are compared with analytical contact mechanics models based on continuum mechanics.",0,1,1
"The die-to-die calibrated combined model of negative bias temperature instability and gate oxide breakdown from device to system
Abstract In the nanoscale regime, the aggressive scaling of devices is affected by several severe reliability issues, including negative bias temperature instability (NBTI) and gate oxide breakdown (GOBD). Generally, the mathematical models of NBTI and GOBD are derived from device level test structures with accelerated tests. However, although both models are highly dependent on temperature and the gate voltage and both mechanisms are based on the probability of trap generation in the oxide layer, each model has a different impact on circuit performances. In this paper, we use a physical probability model of trap generation for both mechanisms. We first simulate the impact on circuits using process models involving threshold voltage shifts and gate oxide leakage currents for NBTI and GOBD, respectively. Then, we find a relationship between the model parameters and power/ground signal degradation. We find the stress conditions that make each of the two mechanisms dominant in the power/ground signal. We calibrate the NBTI and GOBD model parameters of each chip to experimental results. Hence, it becomes possible to identify chips that are more or less vulnerable to NBTI and GOBD.",0,1,1

"A Cross-Company Ethnographic Study on Software Teams for DevOps and Microservices: Organization, Benefits, and Issues
Context: DevOps and microservices are acknowledged to be important new paradigms to tackle contemporary software demands and provide capabilities for rapid and reliable software development. Industrial reports show that they are quickly adopted together in massive software companies. However, because of the technical and organizational requirements, many difficulties against efficient implementation of the both emerge in real software teams. Objectives: This study aims to discover the organization, benefits and issues of software teams using DevOps & microservices from an immersive perspective. Method: An ethnographic study was carried out in three companies with different business, size, products, customers, and degree of globalization. All the three companies claimed their adoption of DevOps and microservices. Seven months (cumulative) of participant observations and nine interviews with practitioners were conducted to collect the data of software teams related to DevOps and microservices. A cross-company empirical investigation using grounded theory was done by analyzing the archive data. Results: The virtual software teams were organized for adopting DevOps and microservices under the stubborn organizational structure. The adoption of DevOps and microservices brings benefits to rapid delivery, ability improvements and burden reduction, whilst the high cost and lack of practical guidance were emerged. Two major issues of adopting DevOps and microservices in software teams (i.e. fragmentary DevOps and abuse of microservices) were found common in the companies. Moreover, our observations and interviews reflect that in software teams, the relationship between DevOps and microservices is not significant, which differs from the relationship described in the previous studies. Four lessons for practitioners and four implications for researchers were discussed based on our findings. Conclusion: Our findings contribute to the understanding of the organization, benefits and issues of adopting DevOps and microservices from an immersive perspective of software teams.",0,1,0

"Low-Cost X/Ku/Ka-Band Dual-Polarized Array With Shared Aperture
This paper presents a novel tri-band (X/Ku/Ka-band) planar antenna array with dual polarizations and shared aperture. Compared with traditional dual-polarized arrays, the proposed array has advantages of low cost, low profile, and high integration. Three types of antennas resonating at different frequencies, including the perforated patch, stacked patch, and slim crosspatch, are innovatively interleaved in the same aperture. The crosspatch fed by proximity coupling is presented as Ku-band element for its advantages of compact size, high isolation, and pure polarization. The techniques such as series feed and reverse feed are utilized to implement the six feed networks in a compact size with reduced cross polarizations. Measured results agree well with the simulations, showing three operation bands at X-, Ku-, and Ka-bands with the bandwidths of 3.6%, 6.7%, and 5.3%, respectively. The antenna also exhibits excellent radiation performance with the cross-polarization discrimination over 25 dB at the three bands. To the best of the author’s knowledge, this is the first shared-aperture X/Ku/Ka-band dual-polarized antenna array reported, which is useful for potential synthetic aperture radar applications.",0,1,0
"PRACTICAL LESSONS ON ROAD CONSTRUCTION IN BLACK COTTON SOIL AREAS
The paper outlines the lessons learned in the construction of embankments and pavements over black cotton soil subgrades. The performance of the Indian Roads Congress test track project at peravali, a.p. especially constructed for the purpose provides the basic material for the paper. In the case of embankments built up of black cotton soil, it is reiterated that pulverisation of clods, compaction at field optimum moisture content, checking up on the density obtained, shoulder treatment and protection of side slopes need special attention. Introduction of a granular blanket course, maintenance of a minimum free-board and provision of good drainage conditions are highlighted as some of the prerequisites for the successful performance of a flexible pavement on black cotton soil subgades. Further, a comparison between the performance of different types of blanket courses and sub-bases has been attempted.(a) (TRRL)",0,1,1
"Prediction of aerodynamic flow fields using convolutional neural networks
An approximation model based on convolutional neural networks (CNNs) is proposed for flow field predictions. The CNN is used to predict the velocity and pressure field in unseen flow conditions and geometries given the pixelated shape of the object. In particular, we consider Reynolds Averaged Navier–Stokes (RANS) flow solutions over airfoil shapes as training data. The CNN can automatically detect essential features with minimal human supervision and is shown to effectively estimate the velocity and pressure field orders of magnitude faster than the RANS solver, making it possible to study the impact of the airfoil shape and operating conditions on the aerodynamic forces and the flow field in near-real time. The use of specific convolution operations, parameter sharing, and gradient sharpening are shown to enhance the predictive capabilities of the CNN. We explore the network architecture and its effectiveness in predicting the flow field for different airfoil shapes, angles of attack, and Reynolds numbers.",0,0,1
"Challenges of Using Building Regulations in Architecture from the Perspective of Design Research
The use of building regulations in architectural design has been a controversial issue for a long time. From the view point of critics, building regulations inhibit innovation, promote conservative design and are incapable of insuring design quality. From the defenders point of view, some professional mentalities of architects regarding building regulations are problematical and must be changed. The present research aims to illuminate the reasons for the abovementioned tension between architectural design and building regulations. This is done by examining the structural match between architectural design and building regulations. Seeing from a designer point of view, the paper compares formal characteristics of building regulations with architectural design. Three general characteristics of building regulations are found in contrast to characteristics of architectural design. Building regulations are analytical in nature, while architectural design is a synthesis-oriented act. Building regulations are mainly based on a reductionist approach towards defining design problems and solutions, while innovation and originality are considered as fundamental values by most architects. And thirdly, building regulations are usually framed in a way that matches an evaluative mode of thought, while architects often have to work in a generative and predictive mode. These explain why architects from time to time feel frustrated with regulations. The paper continues to make recommendations to both architectural designers and regulators. To the designers some facts and points are stated to help them better understand the nature and performance of building regulations and guide them safely and positively use regulations in their design process. Addressing the legislators, the paper offers some recommendations to facilitate the use of building regulations in architectural design. Moving towards performance-based regulations, a broader involvement of information technology in building regulations, and production of designer-oriented guidance documents are some of these recommendations. © 2014 Published by TMU (Tarbiat Modares University).",0,1,1
"Transient Stability Prediction of Power Systems Using Post-disturbance Rotor Angle Trajectory Cluster Features
Abstract A machine learning-based approach is proposed to predict the transient stability of power systems after a large disturbance. The post-disturbance trajectories of generator rotor angles are taken as a whole cluster, and 19 cluster features are defined to depict the overall transient stability characteristics of the power systems. A hybrid approach, which combines the linear support vector machine with the decision tree, is proposed to generate the final transient stability classifier. Comprehensive studies are conducted on the IEEE 39-bus and IEEE 145-bus test systems to verify the performance of the proposed approach. Test results show that by using the cluster features and the proposed approach, the transient stability of the power system can be predicted accurately with a shorter training time. Furthermore, the prediction classifier is robust to unknown load levels and network topologies, especially under situations when some generator measurements are unavailable and the number of input cluster features is independent of the system scale, making the proposed approach more suitable to transient stability prediction of large-scale power systems.",0,0,1
"Batching and Matching for Food Delivery in Dynamic Road Networks
Given a stream of food orders and available delivery vehicles, how should orders be assigned to vehicles so that the delivery time is minimized? For a successful assignment strategy, two key decisions need to be made: (1) assignment of orders to vehicles, (2) grouping orders into batches to cope with limited vehicle availability. We show that the minimization problem is not only NP-hard but inapproximable in polynomial time. To mitigate this computational bottleneck, we develop an algorithm called FOODMATCH, which maps the vehicle assignment problem to that of minimum weight perfect matching on a bipartite graph. The solution quality is further enhanced by reducing batching to a graph clustering problem. Extensive experiments on food-delivery data from large metropolitan cities establish that FOODMATCH is substantially better than baseline strategies on a number of metrics.",0,1,0
"Transmit Beamspace DDMA Based Automotive MIMO Radar
The time division multiple access (TDMA) technique has been applied in automotive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) radar. However, it suffers from the transmit energy loss, and as a result the parameter estimation performance degradation when the number of transmit elements increases. To tackle these problems, a transmit beamspace (TB) Doppler division multiple access (DDMA) approach is proposed. First, a phase modulation matrix with empty Doppler spectrum is introduced. By exploiting the empty Doppler spectrum, a test function based on sequential detection is developed to mitigate the Doppler ambiguity in DDMA waveform. Then, a discrete Fourier transform (DFT)-based TB in slow-time is formed. The proposed method can achieve waveform diversity in Doppler domain and generate a TB in slow-time that concentrates the transmitted power in a fixed spatial region to improve the transmit energy distribution for automotive MIMO radar, which is favored by medium/long range radar (MRR/LRR) applications. As compared to the conventional TDMA technique, the proposed TB DDMA approach can fully exploit the transmission capabilities of all transmit elements to ensure that the emitted power is efficiently used and inherits easy implementation.Moreover, the proposed TB DDMA method avoids the trade-off between the active time for each transmit antenna element and the frame time due to Doppler ambiguity mitigation. Simulation results verify the effectiveness of the proposed TB DDMA approach for automotive MIMO radar.",1,1,0
"Dark Patterns after the GDPR: Scraping Consent Pop-ups and Demonstrating their Influence
New consent management platforms (CMPs) have been introduced to the web to conform with the EU's General Data Protection Regulation, particularly its requirements for consent when companies collect and process users' personal data. This work analyses how the most prevalent CMP designs affect people's consent choices. We scraped the designs of the five most popular CMPs on the top 10,000 websites in the UK (n=680). We found that dark patterns and implied consent are ubiquitous; only 11.8% meet our minimal requirements based on European law. Second, we conducted a field experiment with 40 participants to investigate how the eight most common designs affect consent choices. We found that notification style (banner or barrier) has no effect; removing the opt-out button from the first page increases consent by 22-23 percentage points; and providing more granular controls on the first page decreases consent by 8-20 percentage points. This study provides an empirical basis for the necessary regulatory action to enforce the GDPR, in particular the possibility of focusing on the centralised, third-party CMP services as an effective way to increase compliance.",0,1,0
"Automated tactical maneuver discovery, reasoning and trajectory planning for autonomous driving
In a hierarchical motion planning system for urban autonomous driving, it is a common practice to separate tactical reasoning from the lower-level trajectory planning.

We therefore propose a planning method that automatically discovers tactical maneuver patterns, and fuses pattern reasoning and sampling-based trajectory planning.

"A Tendon-Driven Robot Gripper With Passively Switchable Underactuated Surface and its Physics Simulation Based Parameter Optimization
In this letter, we propose a single-actuator gripper that can lift thin objects lying on a flat surface, in addition to the ability as a standard parallel gripper. The key is a crawler on the fingertip, which is underactuated together with other finger joints and switched with a passive and spring-loaded mechanism. While the idea of crawling finger is not a new one, this letter contributes to realize the crawling without additional motor. The gripper can passively change the mode from the parallel approach mode to the pull-in mode, then finally to the power grasp mode, according to the grasping state. To optimize the highly underactuated system, we take a combination of black-box optimization and physics simulation of the whole grasp process. We show that this simulation-based approach can effectively consider the pre-contact motion, in-hand manipulation, power grasp stability, and even failure mode, which is difficult for the static-equilibrium-analysis-based approaches. In the last part of the letter, we demonstrate that a prototype gripper with the proposed structure and design parameters optimized under the proposed process successfully power-grasped a thin sheet, a softcover book, and a cylinder lying on a flat surface.",1,1,1

"When Will AI Exceed Human Performance? Evidence from AI Experts

 
 
 
Advances in artificial intelligence (AI) will transform modern life by reshaping transportation, health, science, finance, and the military. To adapt public policy, we need to better anticipate these advances. Here we report the results from a large survey of machine learning researchers on their beliefs about progress in AI. Researchers predict AI will outperform humans in many activities in the next ten years, such as translating languages (by 2024), writing high-school essays (by 2026), driving a truck (by 2027), working in retail (by 2031), writing a bestselling book (by 2049), and working as a surgeon (by 2053). Researchers believe there is a 50% chance of AI outperforming humans in all tasks in 45 years and of automating all human jobs in 120 years, with Asian respondents expecting these dates much sooner than North Americans. These results will inform discussion amongst researchers and policymakers about anticipating and managing trends in AI.

"Weak ties strengthen anger contagion in social media
Increasing evidence suggests that, similar to face-to-face communications, human emotions also spread in online social media. However, the mechanisms underlying this emotion contagion, for example, whether different feelings spread in unlikely ways or how the spread of emotions relates to the social network, is rarely investigated. Indeed, because of high costs and spatio-temporal limitations, explorations of this topic are challenging using conventional questionnaires or controlled experiments. Because they are collection points for natural affective responses of massive individuals, online social media sites offer an ideal proxy for tackling this issue from the perspective of computational social science. In this paper, based on the analysis of millions of tweets in Weibo, surprisingly, we find that anger travels easily along weaker ties than joy, meaning that it can infiltrate different communities and break free of local traps because strangers share such content more often. Through a simple diffusion model, we reveal that weaker ties speed up anger by applying both propagation velocity and coverage metrics. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time that quantitative long-term evidence has been presented that reveals a difference in the mechanism by which joy and anger are disseminated. With the extensive proliferation of weak ties in booming social media, our results imply that the contagion of anger could be profoundly strengthened to globalize its negative impact.",0,1,0
"Energy Crowdsourcing and Peer-to-Peer Energy Trading in Blockchain-Enabled Smart Grids
The power grid is rapidly transforming, and while recent grid innovations increased the utilization of advanced control methods, the next-generation grid demands technologies that enable the integration of distributed energy resources (DERs)—and consumers that both seamlessly buy and sell electricity. This paper develops an optimization model and blockchain-based architecture to manage the operation of crowdsourced energy systems (CESs), with peer-to-peer (P2P) energy trading transactions (ETTs). An operational model of CESs in distribution networks is presented considering various types of ETT and crowdsourcees. Then, a two-phase operation algorithm is presented: Phase I focuses on the day-ahead scheduling of generation and controllable DERs, whereas Phase II is developed for hour-ahead or real-time operation of distribution networks. The developed approach supports seamless P2P energy trading between individual prosumers and/or the utility. The presented operational model can also be used to operate islanded microgrids. The CES framework and the operation algorithm are then prototyped through an efficient blockchain implementation, namely, the IBM Hyperledger Fabric. This implementation allows the system operator to manage the network users to seamlessly trade energy. Case studies and prototype illustration are provided.",0,1,1
"The Dangers of Underclaiming: Reasons for Caution When Reporting How NLP Systems Fail
Researchers in NLP often frame and discuss research results in ways that serve to deemphasize the field’s successes, often in response to the field’s widespread hype. Though well-meaning, this has yielded many misleading or false claims about the limits of our best technology. This is a problem, and it may be more serious than it looks: It harms our credibility in ways that can make it harder to mitigate present-day harms, like those involving biased systems for content moderation or resume screening. It also limits our ability to prepare for the potentially enormous impacts of more distant future advances.

"Phishing in Organizations: Findings from a Large-Scale and Long-Term Study
In this paper, we present findings from a largescale and long-term phishing experiment that we conducted in collaboration with a partner company. Our experiment ran for 15 months during which time more than 14,000 study participants (employees of the company) received different simulated phishing emails in their normal working context. We also deployed a reporting button to the company’s email client which allowed the participants to report suspicious emails they received. We measured click rates for phishing emails, dangerous actions such as submitting credentials, and reported suspicious emails. The results of our experiment provide three types of contributions. First, some of our findings support previous literature with improved ecological validity. One example of such results is good effectiveness of warnings on emails. Second, some of our results contradict prior literature and common industry practices. Surprisingly, we find that embedded training during simulated phishing exercises, as commonly deployed in the industry today, does not make employees more resilient to phishing, but instead it can have unexpected side effects that can make employees even more susceptible to phishing. And third, we report new findings. In particular, we are the first to demonstrate that using the employees as a collective phishing detection mechanism is practical in large organizations. Our results show that such crowd-sourcing allows fast detection of new phishing campaigns, the operational load for the organization is acceptable, and the employees remain active over long periods of time.",0,0,0
"Unified Virtual Oscillator Control for Grid-Forming and Grid-Following Converters
A unified virtual oscillator controller (uVOC) is proposed, which enables a unified analysis, design, and implementation framework for both grid-forming (GFM) and grid-following (GFL) voltage-source converters (VSCs). Oscillator-based GFM controllers, such as dispatchable virtual oscillator control (dVOC), offer a rigorous analytical framework with enhanced synchronization but lack effective fault handling capability, which severely limits practical application. The proposed uVOC facilitates synchronization with an arbitrarily low grid voltage and fast overcurrent limiting; this enables effective fault ride-through unlike existing GFM controllers which typically switch to a back-up controller during the fault. GFM operation with uVOC is achieved in both grid-connected and islanded modes with seamless transitions between the two. In GFL converters, bidirectional power flow control and dc bus voltage regulation are achieved with uVOC. No phase-locked loop (PLL) is required for either GFL or GFM operation circumventing the synchronization issues associated with PLLs in weak grid applications. Detail small-signal models for GFM and GFL operation have been developed, and the systematic design guidelines for controller parameters are provided. The proposed controller is validated through hardware experiments in a hybrid ac–dc microgrid.",1,0,1
"Sputtered AlN Thin Films for Piezoelectric MEMS Devices - FBAR Resonators and Accelerometers
Over the past two decades, significant advances have been made in the field of micromachined sensors and actuators. As microelectromechanical systems (MEMS) have become mainstream, a clear need for the integration of materials other than silicon and its compounds into micromachined transducers has emerged. MEMS devices based on piezoelectric materials take advantage of the high energy transduction that scales very favorably upon miniaturization leading to an ever-growing interest in piezoelectric films for MEMS applications. Piezoelectric materials provide a direct transduction mechanism to convert signals from mechanical to electrical domains and vice versa. The reversible and linear piezoelectric effect manifests as the production of a charge (voltage) upon application of stress (direct effect) and/or as the production of strain (stress) upon application of an electric field (converse effect). Transducers using piezoelectric materials can be configured either as actuators, when the design of the device is optimized for generating strain or stress using the converse piezoelectric effect, or as sensors when the design of the device is optimized for the generation of an electric signal, using direct piezoelectric effect, in response to mechanical input. Furthermore, piezoelectric devices also allow the integration of sensing and actuating elements in one device (Xu et al., 2002). The elementary piezoelectric effects are given by",0,1,1
"Stochastic Hosting Capacity in LV Distribution Networks
Hosting capacity is defined as the level of penetration that a particular technology can connect to a distribution network without causing power quality problems. In this work, we study the impact of solar photovoltaics (PV) on voltage rise. In most cases, the locations and sizes of the PV are not known in advance, so hosting capacity must be considered as a random variable. Most hosting capacity methods study the problem considering a large number of scenarios, many of which provide little additional information. We overcome this problem by studying only cases where voltage constraints are active, with results illustrating a reduction in the number of scenarios required by an order of magnitude. A linear power flow model is utilised for this task, showing excellent performance. The hosting capacity is finally studied as a function of the number of generators connected, demonstrating that assumptions about the penetration level will have a large impact on the conclusions drawn for a given network.",0,1,1
"A review of flywheel energy storage systems: state of the art and opportunities
Thanks to the unique advantages such as long life cycles, high power density, minimal environmental impact, and high power quality such as fast response and voltage stability, the flywheel/kinetic energy storage system (FESS) is gaining attention recently. There is noticeable progress in FESS, especially in utility, large-scale deployment for the electrical grid, and renewable energy applications. This paper gives a review of the recent developments in FESS technologies. Due to the highly interdisciplinary nature of FESSs, we survey different design approaches, choices of subsystems, and the effects on performance, cost, and applications. This review focuses on the state of the art of FESS technologies, especially those commissioned or prototyped. We also highlighted the opportunities and potential directions for the future development of FESS technologies.",0,1,1
"Wide-Area Measurement System-Based Low Frequency Oscillation Damping Control Through Reinforcement Learning
Ensuring the stability of power systems is gaining more attention today than ever before due to the rapid growth of uncertainties in load and increased renewable energy penetration. Lately, wide-area measurement system (WAMS)-based centralized controlling techniques are offering flexibility and more robust control to keep the system stable. WAMS-based controlling techniques, however, face pressing challenges of irregular delays in long-distance communication channels and subsequent responses of equipment to control actions. This paper presents an innovative control strategy for damping down low-frequency oscillations in transmission systems. The method uses a reinforcement learning technique to overcome the challenges of communication delays and other non-linearity in wide-area damping control. It models the traditional problem of oscillation damping control as a novel faster exploration-based deep deterministic policy gradient (DDPG-S). An effective reward function is designed to capture necessary features of oscillations enabling timely damping of such oscillations, even under various kinds of uncertainties. A detailed analysis and a systematically designed numerical validation are presented to prove feasibility, scalability, interpretability, and comparative performance of the modelled low-frequency oscillation damping controller. The benefit of the technique is that stability is ensured even when uncertainties of load and generation are on the rise.",0,0,1
"Reinforcement Learning for Optimal Control of a District Cooling Energy Plant
District cooling energy plants (DCEPs) consisting of chillers, cooling towers, and thermal energy storage (TES) systems consume a considerable amount of electricity. Optimizing the scheduling of the TES and chillers to take advantage of time-varying electricity price is a challenging optimal control problem. The classical method, model predictive control (MPC), requires solving a high dimensional mixed-integer nonlinear program (MINLP) because of the on/off actuation of the chillers and charge/discharge of TES, which are computationally challenging. RL is an attractive alternative: the real time control computation is a low-dimensional optimization problem that can be easily solved. However, the performance of an RL controller depends on many design choices.In this paper, we propose a Q-learning based reinforcement learning (RL) controller for this problem. Numerical simulation results show that the proposed RL controller is able to reduce energy cost over a rule-based baseline controller by approximately 8%, comparable to savings reported in the literature with MPC for similar DCEPs. We describe the design choices in the RL controller, including basis functions, reward function shaping, and learning algorithm parameters. Compared to existing work on RL for DCEPs, the proposed controller is designed for continuous state and actions spaces.",1,1,1
"Control method of robot suit HAL working as operator's muscle using biological and dynamical information
For assisting human motion, assistive devices working as muscles would be useful. A robot suit HAL (hybrid assistive limb) has been developed as an assistive device for lower limbs. Human can appropriately produce muscle contraction torque and control joint viscoelasticity by muscle effort such as co-contraction. Thus, to implement functions equivalent to human muscles using HAL, it is necessary to control viscoelasticity of HAL as well as to produce torque in accordance with operator's intention. Therefore the purpose of this study is to propose a control method of HAL using biological and motion information. In this method, HAL produces torque corresponding to muscle contraction torque by referring to the myoelectricity that is biological information to control operator's muscles. In addition, the viscoelasticities of HAL are adjusted in proportion to operator's viscoelasticity that is estimated from motion information by using an on-line parameter identification method. To evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed method, the method was applied to a swinging motion of a lower leg. When this method was applied, HAL could work like operator's muscles in the swinging motion, and as a consequence, the muscle activities of the operator were reduced. As a result of this experiment, we confirmed the effectiveness of the proposed method.",0,0,1
"Validation of ultrasonic image boundary recognition in abdominal aortic aneurysm
An aneurysm of the abdominal aorta (AAA) is characterized by modified wall properties, and a balloon-like area usually filled by a thrombus. A rupture of an aortic aneurysm can be fatal, yet there is no way to accurately predict such an occurrence. The study of the wall and thrombus cross-sectional distension, due to a pressure wave, is important as a way of assessing the degradation of the mechanical properties of the vessel wall and the risk of a rupture. Echo ultrasound transverse cross-sectional imaging is used here to study the thrombus and the aortic wall distension, requiring their segmentation within the image. Polar coordinates are defined, and a search is performed for minimizing a cost function, which includes a description of the boundary (based on a limited series of sine and cosine functions) and information from the image intensity gradients along the radii. The method is based on filtering by a modified Canny-Deriche edge detector and then on minimization of an energy function based on five parts. Since echoes from blood in the lumen and the thrombus produce similar patterns and speckle noise, a modified version for identifying the lumen-thrombus border was developed. The method has been validated by various ways, including parameter sensitivity testing and comparison to the performance of an expert. It is robust enough to track the lumen and total arterial cross-sectional area changes during the cardiac cycle. In 34 patients where sequences of images were acquired, the border between the thrombus and the arterial wall was detected with errors less than 2%, while the lumen-thrombus border was detected with a mean error of 4%. Thus, a noninvasive measurement of the AAA cross-sectional area is presented, which has been validated and found to be accurate.",0,1,1

"Multiobjective Optimal Sizing of Hybrid Energy Storage System for Electric Vehicles
Energy storage system (ESS) is an essential component of electric vehicles, which largely affects their driving performance and manufacturing cost. A hybrid energy storage system (HESS) composed of rechargeable batteries and ultracapacitors shows a significant potential for maximally exploiting their complementary characteristics. This study focuses on optimal HESS sizing of an example electric vehicle using a multi-objective optimization algorithm, with the overarching goal of reducing the ESS cost while prolonging battery life. To this end, a battery state-of-health model is incorporated to quantitatively investigate the impact of component sizing on battery life. The wavelet-transform-based power management algorithm is adopted to realize the power coordination between the batteries and ultracapacitors, in which the ultracapacitors are responsible for handling high-frequency power transients, whereas the batteries deal with average power leveling. The Urban Dynamometer Driving Schedule is used to represent real power demands.",0,1,1
"A Systematic Review of Productivity Factors in Software Development
Analysing and improving productivity has been one of the main goals of software engineering research since its beginnings. A plethora of studies has been conducted on various factors that resulted in several models for analysis and prediction of productivity. However, productivity is still an issue in current software development and not all factors and their relationships are known. This paper reviews the large body of available literature in order to distill a list of the main factors influencing productivity investigated so far. The measure for importance here is the number of articles a factor is mentioned in. Special consideration is given to soft or human-related factors in software engineering that are often not analysed with equal detail as more technical factors. The resulting list can be used to guide further analysis and as basis for building productivity models.",0,1,0
"Finite element modal formulation for panel flutter at hypersonic speeds and elevated temperatures
FINITE ELEMENT MODAL FORMULATION FOR PANEL FLUTTER AT HYPERSONIC SPEEDS AND ELEVATED TEMPERATURES Guangfeng Cheng Old Dominion University, 2002 Director: Dr. Chuh Mei A finite element time domain modal formulation for analyzing flutter behavior of aircraft surface panels in hypersonic airflow has been developed and presented for the first time. Von Karman large deflection plate theory is used for description of the structural nonlinearity and third order piston theory is employed to account for the aerodynamic nonlinearity. The thermal loadings of uniformly distributed temperature and temperature gradients across the panel thickness are incorporated into the finite element formulation. By applying the modal reduction technique, the number of governing equations of motion is reduced dramatically so that the computational time of direct numerical integration is dropped significantly. All possible types of panel behavior, including flat, buckled but dynamically stable, limit cycle oscillation (LCO), periodic motion, and chaotic motion can be observed and analyzed. As examples of the applications of the proposed methodology, flutter responses of isotropic, specially orthotropic and laminated composite panels are investigated. Special emphasis is put on the boundary between LCO and chaos, as well as the routes to chaos. A systematic mode filtering procedure that helps mode selection without specific knowledge of the complex mode shapes is presented and illustrated. Influences of aerodynamic parameters, including aerodynamic damping and Mach number, on the panel flutter responses are studied. The importance of nonlinear aerodynamic terms is examined in detail. The Reproduced with permission of the copyright owner. Further reproduction prohibited without permission. supporting conditions and panel aspect ratio on the onset condition of chaos are also investigated as an illustration of optimization among different design options. Several mathematical tools, including the time history, phase plane plot, Poincard map, and bifurcation diagram are employed in the chaos study. The largest Lyapunov exponent is also evaluated to assist in detection of chaos. It is found that at low or moderately high nondimensional dynamic pressures, the fluttering panel typically takes a period-doubling route to evolve into chaos, whereas at high nondimensional dynamic pressure, the route to chaos generally involves bursts of chaos and rejuvenations of periodic motions. Various bifurcation behaviors, such as the Hopf bifurcation, pitchfork bifurcation, and transcritical bifurcation, are observed. On the basis of the successful applications presented, the proposed finite element time domain modal formulation and the mode filtering procedure have proven to be an efficient and practical design tool for designers of hypersonic vehicles.

"An adaptive MPC scheme for energy-efficient control of building HVAC systems
An autonomous adaptive MPC architecture is presented for control of heating, ventilation and air condition (HVAC) systems to maintain indoor temperature while reducing energy use. Although equipment use and occupant changes with time, existing MPC methods are not capable of automatically relearning models and computing control decisions reliably for extended periods without intervention from a human expert. We seek to address this weakness. Two major features are embedded in the proposed architecture to enable autonomy: (i) a system identification algorithm from our prior work that periodically re-learns building dynamics and unmeasured internal heat loads from data without requiring re-tuning by experts. The estimated model is guaranteed to be stable and has desirable physical properties irrespective of the data; (ii) an MPC planner with a convex approximation of the original nonconvex problem. The planner uses a descent and convergent method, with the underlying optimization problem being feasible and convex. A year long simulation with a realistic plant shows that both of the features of the proposed architecture periodic model and disturbance update and convexification of the planning problem are essential to get the performance improvement over a commonly used baseline controller. Without these features, though MPC can outperform the baseline controller in certain situations, the benefits may not be substantial enough to warrant the investment in MPC.",0,1,1
"Combining Dynamic Predictions From Joint Models for Longitudinal and Time-to-Event Data Using Bayesian Model Averaging
The joint modeling of longitudinal and time-to-event data is an active area of statistics research that has received a lot of attention in recent years. More recently, a new and attractive application of this type of model has been to obtain individualized predictions of survival probabilities and/or of future longitudinal responses. The advantageous feature of these predictions is that they are dynamically updated as extra longitudinal responses are collected for the subjects of interest, providing real time risk assessment using all recorded information. The aim of this article is two-fold. First, to highlight the importance of modeling the association structure between the longitudinal and event time responses that can greatly influence the derived predictions, and second, to illustrate how we can improve the accuracy of the derived predictions by suitably combining joint models with different association structures. The second goal is achieved using Bayesian model averaging, which, in this setting, has the very intriguing feature that the model weights are not fixed but they are rather subject- and time-dependent, implying that at different follow-up times predictions for the same subject may be based on different models.

"Insight into the IEEE 802.1 Qcr Asynchronous Traffic Shaping in Time Sensitive Network
TSN is an attractive solution for latency-critical frame transmission built upon IEEE 802 architecture. Tra ﬃ c scheduling and shaping in TSN aim to achieve bounded low latency and zero congestion loss. However, the most widespread solution (i.e. Time-Aware Shaper) requires a network-wide precision clock reference and only targets on cyclical tra ﬃ c ﬂows. This paper focuses on the performance evaluation of the ATS, which applies shaping algorithm to any ﬂows and requires no clock reference. Simulations are proposed for evaluation and comparison. Metrics including end-to-end delay, bu ﬀ er usage and frame loss rate are collected to assess the shaping performance. Results show that ATS achieves e ﬀ ective tra ﬃ c shaping and switching without synchronous mechanisms, while there is an evident trade-o ﬀ for using these speciﬁc algorithms.",0,1,0
"FAST-LIO: A Fast, Robust LiDAR-Inertial Odometry Package by Tightly-Coupled Iterated Kalman Filter

"A method for transient thermal load estimation and its application to identification of aerodynamic heating on atmospheric reentry capsule
Abstract The purpose of this work is to formulate a simple method which can be used for the transient thermal load identification.

"Novel invisible markers for monitoring cracks on masonry structures
Abstract This paper presents a proof of concept for monitoring masonry structures using two different types of markers which are not easily noticeable by human eye but exhibit high reflection when subjected to NIR (near-infrared) wavelength of light. The first type is a retroreflective marker covered by a special tape that is opaque in visible light but translucent in NIR, while the second marker is a paint produced from infrared reflective pigments. The reflection of these markers is captured by a special camera-flash combination and processed using image processing algorithms. A series of experiments were conducted to verify their potential to monitor crack development. It is shown that the difference between the actual crack width and the measured was satisfactorily small. Besides that, the painted markers perform better than the tape markers both in terms of accuracy and precision, while their accuracy could be in the range of 0.05 mm which verifies its potential to be used for measuring cracks in masonry walls or plastered and painted masonry surfaces. The proposed method can be particularly useful for heritage structures, and especially for acute problems like foundation settlement. Another advantage of the method is that it has been designed to be used by non-technical people, so that citizen involvement is also possible in collecting data from the field.",0,1,1
"Fast and Accurate Closest Point Search on Triangulated Surfaces and its Application to Head Motion Estimation
The Iterative Closest Point (ICP) algorithm is widely used to register two roughly aligned surfaces. Its most expensive step is the search for the closest point. Many efficient variants have been proposed to speed up this step, however they do not guarantee that the closest point on a triangulated surface is found. Instead they might result in an approximation of the closest point. In this paper we present a method for the closest point search that is fast and exact. The method was implemented and used to evaluate the accuracy of head motion estimation using dense 3D data obtained from a stereo camera system. The results show that the accuracy of the estimated head motion is better than 1 mm for translational movements and better than 1 degree for rotations.

"Bayesian spectral density approach for identification of bridge section’s flutter derivatives operated in turbulent flow
This study presents a Bayesian spectral density approach for identification and uncertainty quantification of flutter derivatives of bridge sections utilizing buffeting displacement responses, where thewind tunnel test is conducted in turbulent flow. Different from traditional time-domain approaches (e.g., least square method and stochastic subspace identification), the newly-proposed approach is operated in frequency domain. Based on the affine invariant ensemble sampler algorithm, Markov chain Monte-Carlo sampling is employed to accomplish the Bayesian inference. The probability density function of flutter derivatives is modeled based on complex Wishart distribution, where probability serves as the measure. By the Bayesian spectral density approach, the most probable values and corresponding posterior distributions (namely identification uncertainty here) of each flutter derivative can be obtained at the same time.

In this work, as opposed to the previous techniques, we propose a convex optimization problem that leads to an accurate wideband DOA estimation method with no need for any focusing matrix. Moreover, in this method no initial DOA estimates are required and it can be used for any arbitrary linear arrays.

"Investigation on a Wave-Powered Electrical Generator Consisted of a Geared Motor-Generator Housed by a Double-Cone Rolling on Concentric Circular Rails
Abstract—An electrical generator able to harness energy from the water waves and designed as a double-cone geared motor-generator (DCGMG), is proposed and theoretically investigated. Similar to a differential gear mechanism, used in the transmission system of the auto vehicle wheels, an angular speed differential is created between the cones rolling on two concentric circular rails. Water wave acting on the floating DCGMG produces and a gear-box amplifies the speed differential to gain sufficient torque for power generation. A model that allows computation of the speed differential, torque, and power of the DCGMG is suggested. Influence of various parameters, regarding the construction of the DCGMG, as well as the contact between the double-cone and rails, on the electro-mechanical output, is emphasized. Results obtained indicate that the generated electrical power can be increased by augmenting the mass of the double-cone, the span of the rails, the apex angle of the cones, the friction between cones and rails, the amplification factor of the gear-box, and the efficiency of the motor-generator.

"Understanding the Signature of Controversial Wikipedia Articles through Motifs in Editor Revision Networks
Wikipedia serves as a good example of how editors collaborate to form and maintain an article. The relationship between editors, derived from their sequence of editing activity, results in a directed network structure called the revision network, that potentially holds valuable insights into editing activity. In this paper we create revision networks to assess differences between controversial and non-controversial articles, as labelled by Wikipedia. Originating from complex networks, we apply motif analysis, which determines the under or over-representation of induced sub-structures, in this case triads of editors. We analyse 21,631 Wikipedia articles in this way, and use principal component analysis to consider the relationship between their motif subgraph ratio profiles. Results show that a small number of induced triads play an important role in characterising relationships between editors, with controversial articles having a tendency to cluster. This provides useful insight into editing behaviour and interaction capturing counter-narratives, without recourse to semantic analysis. It also provides a potentially useful feature for future prediction of controversial Wikipedia articles.",0,1,0
"The quantitative measure and statistical distribution of fame
Fame and celebrity play an ever-increasing role in our culture. However, despite the cultural and economic importance of fame and its gradations, there exists no consensus method for quantifying the fame of an individual, or of comparing that of two individuals. We argue that, even if fame is difficult to measure with precision, one may develop useful metrics for fame that correlate well with intuition and that remain reasonably stable over time. Using datasets of recently deceased individuals who were highly renowned, we have evaluated several internet-based methods for quantifying fame. We find that some widely-used internet-derived metrics, such as search engine results, correlate poorly with human subject judgments of fame. However other metrics exist that agree well with human judgments and appear to offer workable, easily accessible measures of fame. Using such a metric we perform a preliminary investigation of the statistical distribution of fame, which has some of the power law character seen in other natural and social phenomena such as landslides and market crashes. In order to demonstrate how such findings can generate quantitative insight into celebrity culture, we assess some folk ideas regarding the frequency distribution and apparent clustering of celebrity deaths.",0,0,0
"Investigation of a Combined Slip Control Braking and Closed Loop Four Wheel Steering System for an Automobile During Combined Hard Braking and Severe Steering
Conventional anti-lock braking systems (ABS) permit automobiles to achieve short stopping distance with good directional control and stability during moderate manuevers. However, during emergency maneuvers where hard braking is combined with severe steering, normally stable (i.e., understanding) cars, even those equipped with ABS, can spin out due to a change to an unstable oversteer condition. In this work, a new Slip Control Braking System (SCBS) is introduced. The SCBS control algorithm for longitudinal tire slip was based on the sliding mode control method and can maintain pre-specified slip values for both the front and the rear axles. These desired slip values were gain-scheduled as a function of front wheel steer angle. The longitudinal slip control system was then combined with a gain-scheduled, closed loop, four wheel steering system. Simulations of hard braking combined with severe steering indicate that the combined action of the controllers results in a vehicle that can maintain directional control and stability in situations where the vehicle equipped with only four wheel steering and conventional ABS or only the SCBS system looses control and spins out.",0,0,1
"Learning Optimization Proxies for Large-Scale Security-Constrained Economic Dispatch
The Security-Constrained Economic Dispatch (SCED) is a fundamental optimization model for Transmission System Operators (TSO) to clear real-time energy markets while ensuring reliable operations of power grids. In a context of growing operational uncertainty, due to increased penetration of renewable generators and distributed energy resources, operators must continuously monitor risk in real-time, i.e., they must quickly assess the system’s behavior under various changes in load and renewable production. Unfortunately, systematically solving an optimization problem for each such scenario is not practical given the tight constraints of real-time operations. To overcome this limitation, this paper proposes to learn an optimization proxy for SCED, i.e., a Machine Learning (ML) model that can predict an optimal solution for SCED in milliseconds. Motivated by a principled analysis of the market-clearing optimizations of MISO, the paper proposes a novel ML pipeline that addresses the main challenges of learning SCED solutions, i.e., the variability in load, renewable output and production costs, as well as the combinatorial structure of commitment decisions. A novel Classification-Then-Regression architecture is also proposed, to further capture the behavior of SCED solutions. Numerical experiments are reported on the French transmission system, and demonstrate the approach’s ability to produce, within a time frame that is compatible with real-time operations, accurate optimization proxies that produce relative errors below 0.6%.",0,0,1
"A Survey and an Analysis of Network Slicing in 5G Networks
5G networks aim to support a number of vertical industries that are characterized by diverse performance requirements. Network slicing is considered to be the key enabler to enhance cellular networks with the desired flexibility to achieve this target.

"Deep Learning for Intelligent Demand Response and Smart Grids: A Comprehensive Survey
Electricity is one of the mandatory commodities for mankind today. To address challenges and issues in the transmission of electricity through the traditional grid, the concepts of smart grids and demand response have been developed. In such systems, a large amount of data is generated daily from various sources such as power generation (e.g., wind turbines), transmission and distribution (microgrids and fault detectors), load management (smart meters and smart electric appliances). Thanks to recent advancements in big data and computing technologies, Deep Learning (DL) can be leveraged to learn the patterns from the generated data and predict the demand for electricity and peak hours. Motivated by the advantages of deep learning in smart grids, this paper sets to provide a comprehensive survey on the application of DL for intelligent smart grids and demand response. Firstly, we present the fundamental of DL, smart grids, demand response, and the motivation behind the use of DL. Secondly, we review the state-ofthe-art applications of DL in smart grids and demand response, including electric load forecasting, state estimation, energy theft detection, energy sharing and trading. Furthermore, we illustrate the practicality of DL via various use cases and projects. Finally, we highlight the challenges presented in existing research works and highlight important issues and potential directions in the use of DL for smart grids and demand response.",0,0,1
"A 4-GHz Active Scatterer in 130-nm CMOS for Phase Sweep Amplify-and-Forward
This article demonstrates the cooperative diversity improvement achieved using a 120- active scatterer built in 130-nm CMOS technology. The low-power all-analog device acts as a repeater, or relay, for phase sweep amplify-and-forward cooperative transmission. The device relies on microwave reflection to amplify, dynamically phase modulate, and reradiate the incident signal. This reduces the duration of the fades experienced in the indoor radio channel and improves error correction code performance. Radio channel propagation measurements collected using the relay prototype clearly show the effect of the phase modulation on fading and system level simulations conducted using the propagation data show a fivefold increase in coverage area.",0,1,0
"Dark Patterns after the GDPR: Scraping Consent Pop-ups and Demonstrating their Influence
New consent management platforms (CMPs) have been introduced to the web to conform with the EU's General Data Protection Regulation, particularly its requirements for consent when companies collect and process users' personal data. This work analyses how the most prevalent CMP designs affect people's consent choices. We scraped the designs of the five most popular CMPs on the top 10,000 websites in the UK (n=680). We found that dark patterns and implied consent are ubiquitous; only 11.8% meet our minimal requirements based on European law. Second, we conducted a field experiment with 40 participants to investigate how the eight most common designs affect consent choices. We found that notification style (banner or barrier) has no effect; removing the opt-out button from the first page increases consent by 22-23 percentage points; and providing more granular controls on the first page decreases consent by 8-20 percentage points. This study provides an empirical basis for the necessary regulatory action to enforce the GDPR, in particular the possibility of focusing on the centralised, third-party CMP services as an effective way to increase compliance.",0,1,0

"Non-Stationarities in Extra-Large-Scale Massive MIMO
Massive MIMO, a key technology for increasing area spectral efficiency in cellular systems, was developed assuming moderately sized apertures. In this article, we argue that massive MIMO systems behave differently in large-scale regimes due to spatial non-stationarity. In the large-scale regime, with arrays of around 50 wavelengths, the terminals see the whole array but non-stationarities occur because different regions of the array see different propagation paths. At even larger dimensions, which we call the extra-large scale regime, terminals see a portion of the array and inside the first type of non-stationarities might occur. We show that the non-stationarity properties of the massive MIMO channel change several important MIMO design aspects. In simulations, we demonstrate how non-stationarity is a curse when neglected but a blessing when embraced in terms of computational load and multi-user transceiver design.",0,0,0
"HapFIC: An Adaptive Force/Position Controller for Safe Environment Interaction in Articulated Systems
Haptic interaction is essential for the dynamic dexterity of animals, which seamlessly switch from an impedance to an admittance behaviour using the force feedback from their proprioception. However, this ability is extremely challenging to reproduce in robots, especially when dealing with complex interaction dynamics, distributed contacts, and contact switching. Current model-based controllers require accurate interaction modelling to account for contacts and stabilise the interaction. In this manuscript, we propose an adaptive force/position controller that exploits the fractal impedance controller’s passivity and non-linearity to execute a finite search algorithm using the force feedback signal from the sensor at the end-effector. The method is computationally inexpensive, opening the possibility to deal with distributed contacts in the future. We evaluated the architecture in physics simulation and showed that the controller can robustly control the interaction with objects of different dynamics without violating the maximum allowable target forces or causing numerical instability even for very rigid objects. The proposed controller can also autonomously deal with contact switching and may find application in multiple fields such as legged locomotion, rehabilitation and assistive robotics.",0,1,1
"Accurate quantitative estimation of energy performance of residential buildings using statistical machine learning tools
Abstract We develop a statistical machine learning framework to study the effect of eight input variables (relative compactness, surface area, wall area, roof area, overall height, orientation, glazing area, glazing area distribution) on two output variables, namely heating load (HL) and cooling load (CL), of residential buildings. We systematically investigate the association strength of each input variable with each of the output variables using a variety of classical and non-parametric statistical analysis tools, in order to identify the most strongly related input variables. Then, we compare a classical linear regression approach against a powerful state of the art nonlinear non-parametric method, random forests, to estimate HL and CL. Extensive simulations on 768 diverse residential buildings show that we can predict HL and CL with low mean absolute error deviations from the ground truth which is established using Ecotect (0.51 and 1.42, respectively). The results of this study support the feasibility of using machine learning tools to estimate building parameters as a convenient and accurate approach, as long as the requested query bears resemblance to the data actually used to train the mathematical model in the first place.",0,1,1
"Fair ranking: a critical review, challenges, and future directions
Ranking, recommendation, and retrieval systems are widely used in online platforms and other societal systems, including e-commerce, media-streaming, admissions, gig platforms, and hiring. In the recent past, a large “fair ranking” research literature has been developed around making these systems fair to the individuals, providers, or content that are being ranked. Most of this literature defines fairness for a single instance of retrieval, or as a simple additive notion for multiple instances of retrievals over time. This work provides a critical overview of this literature, detailing the often context-specific concerns that such approaches miss: the gap between high ranking placements and true provider utility, spillovers and compounding effects over time, induced strategic incentives, and the effect of statistical uncertainty. We then provide a path forward for a more holistic and impact-oriented fair ranking research agenda, including methodological lessons from other fields and the role of the broader stakeholder community in overcoming data bottlenecks and designing effective regulatory environments.",0,1,0
"3D computational fluid dynamic modelling for pulsatile blood wave propagation in the event of car crash
ABSTRACT Blunt traumatic aortic rupture (BTAR) is one of the leading causes of rapid fatality in motor vehicle crashes. The mechanism of BTAR, however, is still not clear due to its complicated process. This paper looks the pattern alteration of blood wave propagation of the aorta caused by impact loading to identify the sources of rupture of aorta. In this paper, a three-dimensional computational fluid dynamic (CFD) human aortic model was established. Pulsatile pressure and velocity, representing the cardiac transient pressure and velocity for the healthy adult, were applied at the inlet and outlets of aortic model as the boundary conditions. Blood flow propagation along the ascending aorta to thoracic descending aorta were analysed using ABAQUS CFD. The results indicate that the waves as a result of the impact loading have a significant effect on the patterns of blood wave propagation, which may be considered as one of the sources of rupture of aorta.",0,0,1
"System Architecture of Small Unmanned Aerial System for Flight Beyond Visual Line-of-Sight
Abstract : Small Unmanned Aerial Systems (UAS) have increasingly been used in military application. The application in expanding scope of operations has pushed existing small UAS beyond its designed capabilities. This resulted in frequent modifications or new designs. A common requirement in modification or new design of small UAS is to operate beyond visual Line-Of-Sight (LOS) of the ground pilot. Conventional military development for small UAS adopts a design and built approach. Modification of small Remote Control (RC) aircraft, using Commercial-Off-The Shelf (COTS) equipment, offers a more economical alternative with the prospect of shorter development time compared to conventional approach. This research seeks to establish and demonstrate an architecture framework and design a prototype small UAS for operation beyond visual LOS. The aim is to achieve an effective and reliable development approach that is relevant to the military's evolving requirements for small UASs. Key elements of the architecture include Failure Mode Effect and Criticality Analysis (FMECA), fail safe design for loss of control or communication, power management, interface definition, and configuration control to support varying onboard payloads. Flight test was conducted which successfully demonstrated a control handoff between local and remote Ground Station (GS) for beyond visual LOS operation.",0,1,0
"A 3-RSR Haptic Wearable Device for Rendering Fingertip Contact Forces
A novel wearable haptic device for modulating contact forces at the fingertip is presented. Rendering of forces by skin deformation in three degrees of freedom (DoF), with contact—no contact capabilities, was implemented through rigid parallel kinematics. The novel asymmetrical three revolute-spherical-revolute (3-RSR) configuration allowed compact dimensions with minimum encumbrance of the hand workspace. The device was designed to render constant to low frequency deformation of the fingerpad in three DoF, combining light weight with relatively high output forces. A differential method for solving the non-trivial inverse kinematics is proposed and implemented in real time for controlling the device. The first experimental activity evaluated discrimination of different fingerpad stretch directions in a group of five subjects. The second experiment, enrolling 19 subjects, evaluated cutaneous feedback provided in a virtual pick-and-place manipulation task. Stiffness of the fingerpad plus device was measured and used to calibrate the physics of the virtual environment. The third experiment with 10 subjects evaluated interaction forces in a virtual lift-and-hold task. Although with different performance in the two manipulation experiments, overall results show that participants better controlled interaction forces when the cutaneous feedback was active, with significant differences between the visual and visuo-haptic experimental conditions.",0,1,1

"Improved Energy Harvesting from Wideband Vibrations by Nonlinear Piezoelectric Converters
Abstract Vibration harvesters typically are linear mass-spring devices working at resonance. A different approach is here proposed based on nonlinear converters that exploit stochastic resonance with white-noise excitation. A piezoelectric beam converter is coupled to permanent magnets creating a bistable system bouncing between two stable states in response to random excitation. Under proper conditions, this significantly improves energy harvesting from wide-spectrum vibrations. A cantilever beam with added nonlinearity has been simulated by using a MATLAB® Stochastic Differential Equation (SDE) Toolbox with a white-noise vibration. A nonlinear converter was then realized by screen printing low-curing-temperature lead zirconate titanate (PZT) films on steel cantilevers and excited with white-noise vibrations. Experimental results show that the performances of the converter in terms of output voltage at parity of mechanical excitation are markedly improved.",0,0,1
"Constitutive Modeling of Material Damage for Fatigue Failure Prediction
This paper presents a constitutive modeling of material damage capable of characterizing fatigue damage and plastic damage for rate-independent materials under multiaxial loading with the theory of damage mechanics. First, an internal state variable known as the damage variable is introduced with two scalars to characterize material degradation due to the change of material microstructures under fatigue. Then, depending upon the level of applied stress in a material element, the damage accumulation is postulated to undergo two processes, the accumulation of fatigue damage and plastic damage. Two surfaces, fatigue damage surface and plastic damage surface, are proposed to quantify fatigue damage initiation and plastic damage initiation. The damage-coupled constitutive equations of elasticity and plasticity plus two corresponding damage evolution equations are formulated based on the irreversible thermodynamics. Finally, a failure criterion based on the overall damage accumulation is postulated to govern crack initiation and propagation in material elements. A test program to determine the necessary material parameters is also provided. These parameters are considered intrinsic material properties required as the finite element input for predicting damage accumulation under fatigue loading. As an example, experiments are carried out to measure a set of damage parameters for aluminum alloy 2024-T3. The measured parameters are then used to demonstrate systematically how the damage parameters can be effectively evaluated.",0,1,1
"Social Media COVID-19 Information and Vaccine Decision: A Latent Class Analysis
Aims: To identify the impact of the information consumption modalities related to the COVID-19 pandemic and its vaccine, on the vaccination decision among the social media users. Also to study the relationships between vaccination attitudes, and latent subgroups, socio-demographic variables, fear of COVID-19 and perceived stress. Method: A total of 723 subjects (male: n = 353; 48.8%; female: n = 370; 51.2%), aged 31.08 ± 10.77, participated in our survey prepared online on the Google Forms application via the platforms Twitter and Facebook. Results: Five latent classes were identified by the analysis: Class 1 (mixed consumers), class 2 (the largest consumers of social media), class 3 (consumers of official information), class 4 (low consumers of information on the vaccine) and class 5 (social media consumers information verifiers). Also, the subgroup that is knowledgeable about COVID-19 pandemic and its vaccine, and who consumes the most information about the vaccine from official sources, is the one with the highest vaccine acceptance rate. In addition, the hesitant attitude towards the COVID-19 vaccine was linked to gender and mask wearing, while refusal behavior was linked to age, female gender, education level, mask wearing, and fear of COVID-19. Conclusion: The results of the study suggest that specific interventions on social media are needed, to reduce hesitancy rates, and the refusal of vaccination, which is crucial in this period of prevailing of COVID-19 virus.",0,0,0

"Impact of 3D UWB Antenna Radiation Pattern on Air-to-Ground Drone Connectivity
Three dimensional (3D) radiation pattern of an antenna mounted at a drone can significantly influence the air-to-ground (A2G) link quality. Even when a drone transmitter is very close to a ground receiver, if the antenna orientations are not aligned properly, a significant degradation can be observed in the received signal power at the receiver. To characterize such effects for a doughnut-shaped antenna radiation pattern, using an ultra-wideband (UWB) transmitter at the drone and a UWB receiver at the ground, we carry out A2G channel measurements to capture the link quality at the ground receiver for various link distances, drone heights, and antenna orientations. We develop a simple analytical model to approximate the influence of 3D antenna patterns on the received signal strength (RSS), which show reasonable agreement with measurements despite the simplicity of the model and the complicated 3D radiation from the UWB antennas. We also explore how the signal strength can be improved when multiple antennas with different orientations are utilized at transmitter/receiver.",0,0,0
"Configurational forces and nonlinear structural dynamics
Abstract Configurational, or Eshelby-like, forces are shown to strongly influence the nonlinear dynamics of an elastic rod constrained with a frictionless sliding sleeve at one end and with an attached mass at the other end. The configurational force, generated at the sliding sleeve constraint and proportional to the square of the bending moment realized there, has been so far investigated only under quasi-static setting and is now confirmed (through a variational argument) to be present within a dynamic framework. The deep influence of configurational forces on the dynamics is shown both theoretically (through the development of a dynamic nonlinear model in which the rod is treated as a nonlinear spring, obeying the Euler elastica, with negligible inertia) and experimentally (through a specifically designed experimental set-up). During the nonlinear dynamics, the elastic rod may slip alternatively in and out from the sliding sleeve, becoming a sort of nonlinear oscillator displaying a motion eventually ending with the rod completely injected into or completely ejected from the sleeve. The present results may find applications in the dynamics of compliant and extensible devices, for instance, to guide the movement of a retractable and flexible robot arm.",0,0,1

"Thermal Modelling and Controller Design of an Alkaline Electrolysis System under Dynamic Operating Conditions
Thermal management is vital for the eﬃcient and safe operation of alkaline electrolysis systems. Traditional alkaline electrolysis systems use simple proportional-integral-diﬀerentiation (PID) controllers to maintain the stack temperature near the rated value. However, in renewable-to-hydrogen scenarios, the stack temperature is disturbed by load ﬂuctuations, and the temperature overshoot phenomenon occurs which can exceed the upper limit and harm the stack. This paper focuses on the thermal modelling and controller design of an alkaline electrolysis system under dynamic operating conditions. A control-oriented thermal model is established in the form of a third-order time-delay process, which is used for simulation and controller design. Based on this model, we propose two novel controllers to reduce temperature overshoot: one is a current feed-forward PID controller (PID-I), the other is a model predictive controller (MPC). Their performances are tested on a lab-scale system and the experimental results are satisfying: the temperature ∗ These authors contributed equally. ∗∗ overshoot is reduced by 2.2 ◦ C with the PID-I controller, and no obvious overshoot is observed with the MPC controller. Furthermore, the thermal dynamic performance of an MW-scale alkaline electrolysis system is analyzed by simulation, which shows that the temperature overshoot phenomenon is more general in large systems. The proposed method allows for higher temperature set points which can improve system eﬃciency by 1%.",0,1,1

This paper addresses these two inefficiencies by proposing both the use of look-up tables to prevent redundant calculations, and the use of a sorting method to allow the prevention of unnecessary calculations. Either technique, by itself, results in a large reduction in computation time. The greatest time reductions, however, can be achieved when both techniques are used together.",0,0,1
"Are you aware of what you are watching? Role of machine heuristic in online content recommendations
Since recommender systems have been created and developed to automate the recommendation process, users can easily consume their desired video content on online platforms. In this line, several content recommendation algorithms are introduced and employed to allow users to encounter content of their interests, effectively. However, the recommendation systems sometimes regrettably recommend inappropriate content, including misinformation or fake news. To make it worse, people would unreservedly accept such content due to their cognitive heuristic, machine heuristic, which is the rule of thumb that machines are more accurate and trustworthy than humans. In this study, we designed and conducted a web-based experiment where the participants are invoked machine heuristic by experiencing the whole process of machine or human recommendation system. The results demonstrated that participants (N = 89) showed a more positive attitude toward a machine recommender than a human recommender, even the recommended videos contain inappropriate content. While participants who have a high level of trust in machines exhibited a negative attitude toward recommendations. Based on these results, we suggest that a phenomenon known as algorithm aversion might be simultaneously considered with machine heuristic in investigating human interaction with a machine.",1,1,0
"Monolayer MoS2 Strained to 1.3% With a Microelectromechanical System
We report on a modified transfer technique for atomically thin materials integrated into microelectromechanical systems (MEMS) for studying strain physics and creating strain-based devices. Our method tolerates the non-planar structures and fragility of MEMS while still providing precise positioning and crack-free transfer of flakes. Furthermore, our method used the transfer polymer to anchor the 2D crystal to the MEMS, which reduces the fabrication time and increases the yield, and allowed us to exploit the strong mechanical coupling between the 2D crystal and polymer to strain the atomically thin system. We successfully strained single atomic layers of molybdenum disulfide (MoS2) with MEMS devices for the first time and achieved greater than 1.3% strain, marking a major milestone for incorporating 2D materials with MEMS. We used the established strain response of MoS2 Raman and photoluminescence spectra to deduce the strain in our crystals and provide a consistency check.

"A simple Constant Modulus Algorithm for blind equalization suitable for 16-QAM signal
Blind equalization is a technique for adaptive equalization of a communication channel without the aid of training sequences. This paper proposes a simple blind equalization algorithm suitable for 16-QAM signal. In this proposed algorithm, we study a new style of error function of constant modulus algorithm (CMA) aiming at the character of 16-QAM signals constellation. By adjusting the coordinates of received signals this error function will become exactly zero when the channel is perfectly equalized. The superior performance of the proposed algorithm is illustrated for the 16-QAM signal constellation. Compared with CMA, the proposed algorithm has faster convergence rate and lower residual error. In the computer simulation, an underwater acoustic channel model is assumed as a transmission medium and the simulation results demonstrate that the significant improvements in performance is achieved with the proposed equalization algorithm.",0,0,1
"Explanations in Autonomous Driving: A Survey
The automotive industry has witnessed an increasing level of development in the past decades; from manufacturing manually operated vehicles to manufacturing vehicles with a high level of automation. With the recent developments in Artificial Intelligence (AI), automotive companies now employ blackbox AI models to enable vehicles to perceive their environment and make driving decisions with little or no input from a human. With the hope to deploy autonomous vehicles (AV) on a commercial scale, the acceptance of AV by society becomes paramount and may largely depend on their degree of transparency, trustworthiness, and compliance with regulations. The assessment of the compliance of AVs to these acceptance requirements can be facilitated through the provision of explanations for AVs’ behaviour. Explainability is therefore seen as an important requirement for AVs. AVs should be able to explain what they have ‘seen’, done, and might do in environments in which they operate. In this paper, we provide a comprehensive survey of the existing work in explainable autonomous driving. First, we open by providing a motivation for explanations by highlighting the importance of transparency, accountability, and trust in AVs; and examining existing regulations and standards related to AVs. Second, we identify and categorise the different stakeholders involved in the development, use, and regulation of AVs and elicit their AV explanation requirements. Third, we provide a rigorous review of previous work on explanations for the different AV operations (i.e., perception, localisation, planning, vehicle control, and system management). Finally, we discuss pertinent challenges and provide recommendations including a conceptual framework for AV explainability. This survey aims to provide the fundamental knowledge required of researchers who are interested in explanation provisions in autonomous driving.",0,0,0

"Understanding Business Relationship Management in China: A Power and Leverage Perspective
This paper examines whether a power and leverage perspective, successfully applied to analyse extended buyer-supplier relationships in a western context, can be used to analyse business relationships in China. A single embedded case study is presented in this paper and a power and leverage approach is used to analyse business relationships. The power and leverage perspective is applicable for investigating buyer-supplier relationships in a Chinese cultural context. However, in this context using power as coercion is an extremely counterproductive relationship management strategy, which can draw both buyers and suppliers in to a “no-win” or negative sum situation. The findings are based upon a single case, which makes drawing generalisable conclusions more difficult. In addition, although every effort was made to limit the subjectivity of the power and relationship analysis, researcher interpretation of the data was required. In the Chinese business context, it may not be advisable to manage any relationships in an arms-length manner. Chinese business networks are centred on less explicit or formal power relationships and therefore companies that have learnt the rules of the game of exchange in the west need to modify their approach in China. This work extends the understanding of buyer-supplier relationships and provides additional empirical evidence validating a power and leverage perspective. In addition, the paper provides the first assessment of whether this approach can be used in a non-western context without significant modification.",0,0,0
"Economic Valuation and Pricing of Inertia in Inverter-Dominated Power Systems
This paper studies the procurement and pricing of inertial response using a frequency-constrained unit commitment formulation, which co-optimizes the provision of energy and inertia services while accounting for their complementary properties. The proposed approach builds on a two-step process that allows to differentiate between the units being online for energy purposes and the ones committed additionally solely for inertia provision. Subsequently, three novel pricing and payment schemes that reimburse inertia providers in a transparent and fair manner according to their individual participation are proposed. The analysis considers both synchronous and converter-based generators and provides insights regarding the impact of each pricing scheme on total system cost, as well as on the investment signals for technologies capable of offering affordable inertial response. The results show that all three methods will have a beneficial impact on frequency stability and aid the operator in ensuring system reliability, whereas the policy implications to different inertia providing units will vary between the payment schemes.",0,1,1
"Behavioral Aspects of Lighting and Occupancy Sensors in Private Offices : A Case Study of a University Office Building
This paper examines people’s behavior as it relates to lighting usage in private offices in a university office building. Sixty-three private offices were monitored at one-minute intervals for room occupancy and lighting usage over an 11-month period in 1995. Walk-through observations were also conducted, and two written surveys were administered. Four lighting control configurations were tested; two configurations used manual dual-level switching, and two configurations used automated daylighting controls. All rooms had occupancy sensors, however these were disconnected for one group of offices to provide a control group.",0,1,1
"Bot in the Bunch: Facilitating Group Chat Discussion by Improving Efficiency and Participation with a Chatbot
Although group chat discussions are prevalent in daily life, they have a number of limitations. When discussing in a group chat, reaching a consensus often takes time, members contribute unevenly to the discussion, and messages are unorganized. Hence, we aimed to explore the feasibility of a facilitator chatbot agent to improve group chat discussions. We conducted a needfinding survey to identify key features for a facilitator chatbot. We then implemented GroupfeedBot, a chatbot agent that could facilitate group discussions by managing the discussion time, encouraging members to participate evenly, and organizing members' opinions. To evaluate GroupfeedBot, we performed preliminary user studies that varied for diverse tasks and different group sizes. We found that the group with GroupfeedBot appeared to exhibit more diversity in opinions even though there were no differences in output quality and message quantity. On the other hand, GroupfeedBot promoted members' even participation and effective communication for the medium-sized group.",0,1,0

"Massive MIMO: An Introduction
Demand for wireless throughput, both mobile and fixed, will always increase. One can anticipate that, in five or ten years, millions of augmented reality users in a large city will want to transmit and receive 3D personal high-definition video more or less continuously, say 100 megabits per second per user in each direction. Massive MIMO-also called Large-Scale Antenna Systems-is a promising candidate technology for meeting this demand. Fifty-fold or greater spectral efficiency improvements over fourth generation (4G) technology are frequently mentioned. A multiplicity of physically small, individually controlled antennas performs aggressive multiplexing/demultiplexing for all active users, utilizing directly measured channel characteristics. Unlike today's Point-to-Point MIMO, by leveraging time-division duplexing (TDD), Massive MIMO is scalable to any desired degree with respect to the number of service antennas. Adding more antennas is always beneficial for increased throughput, reduced radiated power, uniformly great service everywhere in the cell, and greater simplicity in signal processing. Massive MIMO is a brand new technology that has yet to be reduced to practice. Notwithstanding, its principles of operation are well understood, and surprisingly simple to elucidate.",0,1,0
"Adaptive neural network based dynamic surface control for uncertain dual arm robots
The paper discusses an adaptive strategy to effectively control nonlinear manipulation motions of a dual arm robot (DAR) under system uncertainties including parameter variations, actuator nonlinearities and external disturbances. It is proposed that the control scheme is first derived from the dynamic surface control (DSC) method, which allows the robot’s end-effectors to robustly track the desired trajectories. Moreover, since exactly determining the DAR system’s dynamics is impractical due to the system uncertainties, the uncertain system parameters are then proposed to be adaptively estimated by the use of the radial basis function network (RBFN). The adaptation mechanism is derived from the Lyapunov theory, which theoretically guarantees stability of the closed-loop control system. The effectiveness of the proposed RBFN-DSC approach is demonstrated by implementing the algorithm in a synthetic environment with realistic parameters, where the obtained results are highly promising.",0,0,1
"Adaptive Identifier-Critic-Based Optimal Tracking Control for Nonlinear Systems With Experimental Validation
This article presents and practically validates an identifier-critic-based approximate dynamic programming (ADP) method to online address the optimal tracking control problem for nonlinear continuous-time unknown systems. The imposed assumption on precisely known system dynamics is obviated via a neural network (NN) identifier. A static control is first adopted to retain the steady-state tracking response, while an optimal control derived via the ADP method is proposed to regulate the tracking error by minimizing a cost function. A critic NN is then trained online to obtain the solution of the associated Hamilton–Jacobi–Bellman (HJB) equation. The learning of the identifier NN and critic NN is performed online simultaneously by tailoring a novel adaptation method, which can guarantee the convergence of the estimated NN weights. Consequently, the critic NN can be used to construct the optimal control policy directly, such that the actor NN used in the previous ADP schemes is avoided. Simulations are performed to verify the suggested control, and experiments on a helicopter plant are carried out to show its feasibility and improved control response.",0,0,1
"Traffic collision avoidance system: false injection viability
Safety is a simple concept but an abstract task, specifically with aircraft. One critical safety system, the Traffic Collision Avoidance System II (TCAS), protects against mid-air collisions by predicting the course of other aircraft, determining the possibility of collision, and issuing a resolution advisory for avoidance. Previous research to identify vulnerabilities associated with TCAS’s communication processes discovered that a false injection attack presents the most comprehensive risk to veritable trust in TCAS, allowing for a mid-air collision. This research explores the viability of successfully executing a false injection attack against a target aircraft, triggering a resolution advisory. Monetary constraints precluded access to a physical TCAS unit; instead, this research creates a novel program, TCAS-False Injection Environment (TCAS-FIE), that incorporates real-world distributed computing systems to simulate a ground-based attacker scenario which explores how a false injection attack could target an operational aircraft. TCAS-FIEs’ simulation models are defined by parameters to execute tests that mimic real-world TCAS units during Mode S message processing. TCAS-FIE simulations execute tests over applicable ranges (5–30 miles), altitudes (25–45K ft), and bearings standard for real-world TCAS tracking. The comprehensive tests compare altitude, measure range closure rate, and measure signal strength from another aircraft to determine the delta in bearings over time. In the attack scenario, the ground-based adversary falsely injects a spoofed aircraft with characteristics matching a Boeing 737-800 aircraft, targeting an operational Boeing 737-800 aircraft. TCAS-FIE completes 555,000 simulations using the various ranges, altitudes, and bearings. The simulated success rate to trigger a resolution advisory is 32.63%, representing 181,099 successful resolution advisory triggers out of 555,000 total simulations. The results from additional analysis determine the required ranges, altitudes, and bearing parameters to trigger future resolution advisories, yielding a predictive threat map for aircraft false injection attacks. The resulting map provides situational awareness to pilots in the event of a real-world TCAS anomaly.",0,0,0
"An importance measure for multistate systems with external factors
Many technical systems are operated under the impact of external factors that may cause the systems to fail. For such systems, an interesting question is how those external factors and their impacts on the system can be identified at an earlier stage. Importance measures in reliability engineering are used to prioritise weak components (or states) of a system. Component failures and the impact of external factors in the real world may be statistically dependent as external factors may affect system performance. This paper proposes a new importance measure for analysing the impact of external factors on system performance. The measure can evaluate the degree of the impact of external factors on the system and can therefore help engineers to identify the factors with the strong impact on the system performance. A real-world case study is used to illustrate its applicability.",0,1,0
"The Impact of Working From Home on the Success of Scrum Projects: A Multi-Method Study
The number of companies opting for remote working has been increasing over the years, and Agile methodologies, such as Scrum, were adapted to mitigate the challenges caused by the distributed teams. However, the COVID-19 pandemic imposed a fully working from home context, which has never existed before. This paper investigation a two-phased Multi-Method study. In the first phase, we uncover how working from home impacted Scrum practitioners through a qualitative survey. Then, in the second phase, we propose a theoretical model that we test and generalize using Partial Least Squares - Structural Equation Modeling (PLS-SEM) through a sample study of 200 software engineers who worked from home within Scrum projects. From assessing our model, we can conclude that all the latent variables are reliable and all the hypotheses are significant. Moreover, we performed an Importance-Performance Map Analysis (IPMA), highlighting the benefits of the home working environment and the use of Scrum for project success. We emphasize the importance of supporting the three innate psychological needs of autonomy, competence, and relatedness in the home working environment. We conclude that the home working environment and the use of Scrum both contribute to project success, with Scrum acting as a mediator.",0,1,0
"Continuance intention of baby boomer and X generation as new users of digital payment during COVID-19 pandemic using UTAUT2
The emergence of social distancing and stay at home regulations during the COVID-19 pandemic directly affects people’s lifestyle, including baby boomers and X generation. Many of them have started using digital payments for online or offline transactions to minimize contact with others. This study aims to analyze the continuance intention of the baby boomers and X generation toward the use of digital payments using UTAUT2 (Unified Theory of Acceptance Technology). Data were collected from 320 users with an age range of 40–74 who had just started using digital payments during this pandemic. Structural equation modeling has been used to analyze the data. The result indicates that UTAUT indicators positively affect user satisfaction. User satisfaction positively affects inertia. Overall satisfaction and inertia positively affect continuance intention. Therefore, digital payment companies and banks with digital services can expand their target market beyond Millennials and pay more attention to the older generation like baby boomers and X generation. Managers can find the results of this study useful and beneficial to develop their marketing strategy and take advantage of this situation to increase digital payment users to a broader age range.",0,0,0
"Modeling and simulation for microscopic traffic flow based on multiple headway, velocity and acceleration difference
A new car-following model termed as multiple headway, velocity, and acceleration difference (MHVAD) is proposed to describe the traffic phenomenon, which is a further extension of the existing model of full velocity difference (FVD) and full velocity and acceleration difference (FVAD). Based on the stability analysis, it is shown that the critical value of the sensitivity in the MHVAD model decreases and the stable region is apparently enlarged, compared with the FVD model and other previous models. At the end, the simulation results demonstrate that the dynamic performance of the proposed MHVAD model is better than that of the FVD and FVAD models.",0,0,1
"INFLUENCING BRAND AWARENESS THROUGH SOCIAL MEDIA
Consumers’ awareness of a brand is essential, as brand awareness is considered one of the main reasons that brand and its products are purchased. The use of social media has been regarded a great possibility for brands to increase global brand awareness, however, with continuously increasing competition for attention and fast commercializing social media, getting noticed has become challenging. The main purpose of this study was to use benchmarking to identify concrete actions that can be used to influence brand awareness in social media platforms Facebook and Instagram. Three Finnish interior brands were selected to be benchmarked based on their popularity in social media. Brand posts that were published by Balmuir, Pentik and Vallila Interior between October 2016 and March 2017 were collected and compared to identify concrete actions that can be used to influence brand exposure, customer engagement and electronic word-of-mouth. Based on findings, brand awareness cab be influenced by e.g. posting content (brand posts) regularly; encouraging number of #brandname mentions; utilizing hashtags strategically; co-operating with social influencers and encouraging electronic word-of mouth. However, it is difficult to estimate how much and how fast use of such actions could influence brand awareness.",0,0,0
"BUTTER FLY SHAPE COMPACT MICROSTRIP ANTENNA FOR WIDEBAND APPLICATIONS
In this article, a novel design of butterfly-shaped compact and small size microstrip antenna is proposed. The radiating structure consists of four circular discs in coalesced form and fed with coaxial probe. The initial antenna resonates at 9.64 GHz with impedance bandwidth of 11.41%. The resonance frequency is further reduced to 8.12 GHz with bandwidth 10.10%, when a rectangular slot is incorporated in the initial patch. Finally, two parallel slots are embedded in the initial patch which improves the antenna bandwidth up to 21.50% (6.02–7.47 GHz). The gain and efficiency of this antenna are above 8.80 dBi and 90% respectively across the entire operating band. Radiation pattern is calculated at lower end (6.02 GHz), upper end (7.47 GHz) and centre frequency (6.75 GHz) of operating band. The proposed antenna is fabricated, and measured results are validated with the simulated ones.",0,1,0
"Subterranean MAV Navigation based on Nonlinear MPC with Collision Avoidance Constraints
Micro Aerial Vehicles (MAVs) navigation in subterranean environments is gaining attention in the field of aerial robotics, however there are still multiple challenges for collision free navigation in such harsh environments. This article proposes a novel baseline solution for collision free navigation with Nonlinear Model Predictive Control (NMPC). In the proposed method, the MAV is considered as a floating object, where the velocities on the $x$, $y$ axes and the position on altitude are the references for the NMPC to navigate along the tunnel, while the NMPC avoids the collision by considering kinematics of the obstacles based on measurements from a 2D lidar. Moreover, a novel approach for correcting the heading of the MAV towards the center of the mine tunnel is proposed, while the efficacy of the suggested framework has been evaluated in multiple field trials in an underground mine in Sweden.",0,1,1
"Model-Free Friction Observers for Flexible Joint Robots With Torque Measurements
This paper tackles a friction compensation problem without using a friction model. The unique feature of the proposed friction observer is that the nominal motor-side signal is fed back into the controller instead of the measured signal. By doing so, asymptotic stability and passivity of the controller are maintained. Another advantage of the proposed observer is that it provides a clear understanding for the stiction compensation which is hard to be captured in model-free approaches. This allows to design observers that do not overcompensate for the stiction. The proposed scheme is validated through simulations and experiments.",0,0,1
"Speech Recovery For Real-World Self-Powered Intermittent Devices
The incompleteness of speech inputs severely degrades the performance of all the related speech signal processing applications. Although many researches have been proposed to address this issue, they controlled the data missing conditions by simulation with self-defined masking lengths or sizes. Besides, the masking definitions are different among all these experimental settings. This paper presents a novel intermittent speech recovery (ISR) system for real-world self-powered intermittent devices. Three contributive stages: interpolation, enhancement, and combination are applied to the ISR system for speech reconstruction. The experimental results show that our recovery system increases speech quality by up to 591.7%, while increasing speech intelligibility by up to 80.5%. Most importantly, the proposed ISR system improves the WER scores by up to 52.6%. The promising results not only confirm the effectiveness of the reconstruction but also encourage the utilization of these battery-free wearable/IoT devices.",0,0,1
"Simultaneous Speech Translation for Live Subtitling: from Delay to Display
With the increased audiovisualisation of communication, the need for live subtitles in multilingual events is more relevant than ever. In an attempt to automatise the process, we aim at exploring the feasibility of simultaneous speech translation (SimulST) for live subtitling. However, the word-for-word rate of generation of SimulST systems is not optimal for displaying the subtitles in a comprehensible and readable way. In this work, we adapt SimulST systems to predict subtitle breaks along with the translation. We then propose a display mode that exploits the predicted break structure by presenting the subtitles in scrolling lines. We compare our proposed mode with a display 1) word-for-word and 2) in blocks, in terms of reading speed and delay. Experiments on three language pairs (en→it, de, fr) show that scrolling lines is the only mode achieving an acceptable reading speed while keeping delay close to a 4-second threshold. We argue that simultaneous translation for readable live subtitles still faces challenges, the main one being poor translation quality, and propose directions for steering future research.",0,1,0

"The limitations of the theoretical analysis of applied algorithms
The theoretical analysis of performance has been an important tool in the engineering of algorithms in many application domains. Its goals are to predict the empirical performance of an algorithm and to be a yardstick that drives the design of novel algorithms that perform well in practice. While these goals have been achieved in many instances, they have not been achieved in some other crucial application domains. In this paper, I focus on the example of sequencing bioinformatics, an inter-disciplinary ﬁeld that uses algorithms to extract biological meaning from genome sequencing data. I will demonstrate two concrete examples of how theoretical analysis has failed to achieve its goals but also give one encouraging example of success. I will then catalog some of the challenges of applying theoretical analysis to sequencing bioinformatics, argue why empirical analysis is not enough, and give a vision for improving the relevance of theoretical analysis to sequencing bioinformatics and other application domains. By recognizing the problem, understanding its roots, and providing potential solutions, this work can hopefully be a crucial ﬁrst step towards making theoretical analysis more relevant in modern application domains.",1,1,1

"Can Friends Seed More Buzz and Adoption?
A critical element of word of mouth (WOM) or buzz marketing is to identify seeds, often central actors with high degree in the social network. Seed identification typically requires data on the full network structure, which is often unavailable. We therefore examine the impact of WOM seeding strategies motivated by the friendship paradox to obtain more central nodes without knowing network structure. But higher-degree nodes may communicate less with neighbors; therefore whether friendship paradox motivated seeding strategies increase or reduce WOM and adoption remains an empirical question. We develop and estimate a model of WOM and adoption using data on microfinance adoption across 43 villages in India for which we have data on social networks. Counterfactuals show that the proposed seeding strategies are about 15-20% more effective than random seeding in increasing adoption. Remarkably, they are also about 5-11% more effective than opinion leader seeding, and are relative more effective when we have fewer seeds.",0,1,0

"A wall-climbing robot without any active suction mechanisms
This paper presents a wall-climbing robot that uses passive suction cups as the adhering components. Using a single motor, this robot can not only move on a wall but can also autonomously attach and detach suction cups to the wall. Passive suction cups do not consume additional energy to maintain adhesion. Therefore, the proposed robot can perform the wall-climbing motion with relatively low energy consumption. In order to prevent the robot from falling, a supporting tail was designed. Moreover, load distribution analysis showed that the tail can be used to enhance the distribution of the loads across the suction cups. In this paper, the optimal parameters of the robot are described and a robot is fabricated based on this analysis. We conducted experiments to verify the robot performance.",0,0,1
"Frequency Stability of Synchronous Machines and Grid-Forming Power Converters
An inevitable consequence of the global power system transition toward nearly 100% renewable-based generation is the loss of conventional bulk generation by synchronous machines (SMs), their inertia, and accompanying frequency- and voltage-control mechanisms. This gradual transformation of the power system to a low-inertia system leads to critical challenges in maintaining system stability. Novel control techniques for converters, so-called grid-forming strategies, are expected to address these challenges and replicate functionalities that, so far, have been provided by SMs. This article presents a low-inertia case study that includes SMs and converters controlled under various grid-forming techniques. In this article, the positive impact of the grid-forming converters (GFCs) on the frequency stability of SMs is highlighted, a qualitative analysis that provides insights into the frequency stability of the system is presented, we explore the behavior of the grid-forming controls when imposing the converter dc and ac current limitations, the importance of the dc dynamics in grid-forming control design as well as the critical need for an effective ac current limitation scheme are reported, and finally, we analyze how and when the interaction between the fast GFC and the slow SM dynamics can contribute to the system instability.",0,1,1
"On the Necessity, Scheme, and Basis of the Linear–Nonlinear Switching in Active Disturbance Rejection Control
Active disturbance rejection control (ADRC) was originally given in a nonlinear gain structure to better accommodate the dynamic uncertainties and disturbances. However, the resulting complexity in a theoretical analysis and in the parameter tuning inhibits the applications of an ADRC. ADRC was linearized and parameterized for a practical convenience. Since linear ADRC (LADRC) and nonlinear ADRC (NLADRC) each has its own advantages and disadvantages, choosing between LADRC and NLADRC is rather difficult. As a matter of fact, there is a lack of quantitative analysis and comparison between LADRC and NLADRC. This paper first gives an easy solution in the parameter tuning of the nonlinear extended state observer, followed by a quantitative analysis and comparison study on LADRC and NLADRC; then, an LADRC/NLADRC switching control (SADRC) scheme is proposed and its stability is analyzed; finally, the SADRC scheme is verified by experiment using the ball-beam platform. The proposed SADRC takes the advantage of the additional performance improvement associated with the NLADRC, but make it easier to use.",0,1,1
"Default prediction of online credit loans based on mobile application usage behaviors
Credit scoring is widely used by financial institutions for default prediction, however, a significant portion of online credit loan customers have inadequate or unverifiable credit histories, making it difficult for financial institutions to make effective credit decisions. Since the widespread use of smartphones and the popularity of mobile applications, it is worth investigating whether mobile application usage behaviors (App behaviors) of customers can effectively predict online loan defaults. This paper proposes a combined algorithm of CNN and LightGBM, and establishes credit scoring models with App behaviors to evaluate the default risk of online credit loans based on logistic regression, LightGBM, CNN and the combined algorithm, respectively. The experimental results suggest that App behaviors have an obvious effect on the default prediction of customers applying for online credit loans, and the combined model outperforms the other models in terms of the area under the curve (AUC). Furthermore, integrated credit scoring models are developed by combining App behaviors with traditional scoring features. A comparison of the integrated models and the traditional scoring model indicates that the integrated models have achieved a significant improvement in classification performance and App behaviors can be a powerful complement to the traditional credit scoring model.",0,0,0
"Combining Safe Interval Path Planning and Constrained Path Following Control: Preliminary Results
We study the navigation problem for a robot moving amidst static and dynamic obstacles and rely on a hierarchical approach to solve it.

Aspects of the AI Act, such as different rules for different risk-levels of AI, make sense. But we also find that some provisions of the Draft AI Act have surprising legal implications, whilst others may be largely ineffective at achieving their stated goals. Several overarching aspects, including the enforcement regime and the risks of maximum harmonisation pre-empting legitimate national AI policy, engender significant concern. These issues should be addressed as a priority in the legislative process.",0,1,0

A simple and fast algorithm to model the random distribution of fibres is proposed. The algorithm is statistically characterised and the results show that it is capable of capturing the random distribution typical of these materials even for high fibre volume fractions. Predictions of some effective properties of the lamina through finite element analyses is performed and a good agreement with experimental results is found.",0,0,1
"A foresight study on urban mobility: Singapore in 2040

Purpose
The transportation system in any city is complex and evolving, shaped by various driving forces and uncertainties in the social, economic, technological, political and environmental situations. Its development and demands upon it cannot be projected by simply extrapolating past and current trends. This paper aims to present a foresight study examining the future of urban mobility, focusing on the dense Asian city-state of Singapore. The objective is to develop scenarios for the future of urban mobility, to facilitate future policy implementation by highlighting long term challenges and opportunities for transportation planning in cities.


Design/methodology/approach
To create future scenarios, the authors first sought to identify key drivers of change through environmental scanning, expert interviews, focus group discussions and technology scanning. These drivers of change were subsequently used in a scenario planning workshop, organized to co-create alternative future visions for urban mobility 2040 with experts and local stakeholders.


Findings
Two scenarios emerged, called the Shared World and the Virtual World. For each scenario, the authors described the key features in terms of dominant transport modes for the movements of passengers and freight. Subsequently, the authors discussed possible implications of each scenario to the individual, society, industry and government.


Originality/value
As cities grow and develop, city and transport planners should not only address daily operational issues but also develop a well-informed, long-term understanding of the evolving mobility system to address challenges that lie beyond the five- or even ten-year horizon. By using scenario planning approach, the authors hope to prepare stakeholders for the uncertain futures that are continuously shaped by the decisions today.

"Indoor Propagation Modeling for Radiating Cable Systems in the Frequency Range of 900-2500 MHz
The aim of this paper is to propose and evaluate a semiempirical propagation modeling for radiating cable used in indoor environments. This propagation modeling takes into consideration propagation mechanisms such as reflections, penetration loss and cable termination that result from a particular environment, as well as specific cable paths that actual propagation models for radiating cable systems have not considered. The proposed modeling is carried out using three different propagation models and has been experimentally validated by sets of measurements performed in a university building in the frequency range from 900 MHz to 2.5 GHz. A careful selection of the data sets validates the robustness of the proposed model. The results show a mean of the error less than 1 dB while the standard deviation is between 2.2 dB and 4.6 dB in all cases. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time such a robust modeling for radiating cable operating between 900 MHz to 2.5 GHz has been presented.",0,1,0

The difficulties associated with their application to control power systems are described and discussed as well as strategies that can be adopted to overcome them. Two reinforcement learning modes are considered: the online mode in which the interaction occurs with the real power system and the offline mode in which the interaction occurs with a simulation model of the real power system. We present two case studies made on a four-machine power system model. The first one concerns the design by means of RL algorithms used in offline mode of a dynamic brake controller. The second concerns RL methods used in online mode when applied to control a thyristor controlled series capacitor (TCSC) aimed to damp power system oscillations.",0,0,1
"Improving Peak-to-Average Power Ratio Reduction for OFDM Signals Using Modified Tone Reservation and Clipping-and-Filtering Hybrid Scheme
In this study, the authors analyze the modified tone reservation (TR) and clipping-and-filtering methods to reduce Peak-to-Average Power Ratio (PAPR) of orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) signals and introduce the hybrid algorithm of these modified methods. The key purposes of the proposed algorithm are to increase PAPR reduction again, meet the spectral mask constraints, guarantee a low error rate and simplify the hardware architecture. The experimental results on Matlab of the proposed algorithm for 64-quadrature amplitude modulation (64-QAM) symbol are presented. These results show that the PAPR of OFDM signals is significantly reduced (about 7.12 dB) after four iterations. Performance comparison of the proposed method with some typical methods of PAPR reduction, such as clipping-and-filtering and TR techniques, is presented.",0,1,0
"DeepSOCIAL: Social Distancing Monitoring and Infection Risk Assessment in COVID-19 Pandemic
Social distancing is a recommended solution by the World Health Organisation (WHO) to minimise the spread of COVID-19 in public places. The majority of governments and national health authorities have set the 2-meter physical distancing as a mandatory safety measure in shopping centres, schools and other covered areas. In this research, we develop a generic Deep Neural Network-Based model for automated people detection, tracking, and inter-people distances estimation in the crowd, using common CCTV security cameras. The proposed model includes a YOLOv4-based framework and inverse perspective mapping for accurate people detection and social distancing monitoring in challenging conditions, including people occlusion, partial visibility, and lighting variations. We also provide an online risk assessment scheme by statistical analysis of the Spatio-temporal data from the moving trajectories and the rate of social distancing violations. We identify high-risk zones with the highest possibility of virus spread and infections. This may help authorities to redesign the layout of a public place or to take precaution actions to mitigate high-risk zones. The efficiency of the proposed methodology is evaluated on the Oxford Town Centre dataset, with superior performance in terms of accuracy and speed compared to three state-of-the-art methods.",0,1,0

"Effective balance equations for electrostrictive composites
This work concerns the study of the effective balance equations governing linear elastic electrostrictive composites, where mechanical strains can be observed due to the application of a given electric field in the so-called small strain and moderate electric field regime. The formulation is developed in the framework of the active elastic composites. The latter are defined as composite materials constitutively described by an additive decomposition of the stress tensor into a purely linear elastic contribution and another component, which is assumed to be given and quadratic in the applied electric field when further specialised to electrostrictive composites. We derive the new mathematical model by describing the effective mechanical behaviour of the whole material by means of the asymptotic (periodic) homogenisation technique. We assume that there exists a sharp separation between the micro-scale, where the distance among different sub-phases (i.e. inclusions and/or fibres and/or strata) is resolved, and the macro-scale, which is related to the average size of the whole system at hand. This way, we formally decompose spatial variations by assuming that every physical field and material property are depending on both the macro-scale and the micro-scale. The effective governing equations encode the role of the micro-structure, and the effective contributions to the global stress tensor are to be computed by solving appropriate linear-elastic-type cell problems on the periodic cell. We also provide analytic formulae for the electrostrictive tensor when the applied electric field is either microscopically uniform or given by a suitable multiplicative decomposition between purely microscopically and macroscopically varying components. The obtained results are consistently compared with previous works in the field, and can pave the way towards improvement of smart active materials currently utilised for engineering (possibly bio-inspired) purposes.",0,0,1
"An Integrated 800-MHz Coupled-Resonator Tunable Bandpass Filter in Silver With a Constant Bandwidth
This paper presents a fully integrated tunable lumped filter on silicon using a low-temperature silver micromachining process. A prototype 836-MHz bandpass filter with a 3-dB bandwidth of 5.9% and insertion loss of 4.8 dB is demonstrated in a second-order coupled-resonator configuration. Continuous tuning of 50 MHz is achieved by electrostatically actuating the lateral air-gap capacitors of the filter. To control the bandwidth while tuning the center frequency, reconfigurable termination impedance is proposed. As a proof of concept, a low-noise amplifier with tunable input impedance is designed to interface with the bandpass filter. The tunable impedance is realized at the input of the low-noise amplifier using a shunt positive metal-oxide-semiconductor transistor. The fabrication, design, and measurement results of the filter are detailed, and future research directions to improve the performance of such filters are discussed.",0,1,1
"Social Interactions or Business Transactions?What customer reviews disclose about Airbnb marketplace
Airbnb is one of the most successful examples of sharing economy marketplaces. With rapid and global market penetration, understanding its attractiveness and evolving growth opportunities is key to plan business decision making. There is an ongoing debate, for example, about whether Airbnb is a hospitality service that fosters social exchanges between hosts and guests, as the sharing economy manifesto originally stated, or whether it is (or is evolving into being) a purely business transaction platform, the way hotels have traditionally operated. To answer these questions, we propose a novel market analysis approach that exploits customers’ reviews. Key to the approach is a method that combines thematic analysis and machine learning to inductively develop a custom dictionary for guests’ reviews. Based on this dictionary, we then use quantitative linguistic analysis on a corpus of 3.2 million reviews collected in 6 different cities, and illustrate how to answer a variety of market research questions, at fine levels of temporal, thematic, user and spatial granularity, such as (i) how the business vs social dichotomy is evolving over the years, (ii) what exact words within such top-level categories are evolving, (iii) whether such trends vary across different user segments and (iv) in different neighbourhoods.",0,0,0
"An Empirical Study of the Efficacy of Marketing Communication Mix Elements in Selected Insurance Companies in Nigeria
The objective of this research is to draw attention to the importance of certain elements of marketing communication in premium income generation and the volume of insurance businesses in Nigeria’s insurance industry. Specifically, the study sought to describe the ranked importance of the following six marketing communication mix elements in the two phases of the research interest viz: advertising, personal selling, sales promotion, publicity and public relations, sponsorship and direct marketing. 20 insurance companies out of the industry capacity of 49 were randomly selected from Lagos, Ibadan, Port-Harcourt and Abuja. Data were collected through the use of primary instruments comprising telephone survey method and well structured questionnaire delivered (electronically and hand-to-hand) to the employees of these companies. Findings from the study suggest that advertising, personal selling, and public relations are taking high priority in the minds of marketers of insurance services in Nigeria. While direct marketing is considered appreciable in services delivery improvement of insurance organizations, sponsorship and sales promotions were of low acceptance and unaccepted respectively. The study recommends that effective use of the various elements of marketing communication will help provide information, create more awareness, change attitude and perception, build industry’s image and enhance brand loyalty.",0,1,0
"Strategic sustainable development in the UK construction industry, through the framework for strategic sustainable development, using Building Information Modelling
Abstract The UK Government has set out ambitious plans for all new domestic and commercial buildings to be zero carbon rated by 2016 and 2020 respectively. These are some of the most progressive environmental targets for the built environment in the western world. However, there are also other sustainability issues that need to be addressed by the UK construction industry, particularly negative impacts from the generation of waste. Currently, 100 million tonnes of construction waste, including 13 million tonnes of unused materials, is generated each year, with only 20% currently capable of being recycled. The majority of this waste ends up in landfill, contributing to further pollution of the biosphere. The literature suggests that these negative impacts result from a variety of causes, including ineffective leadership, ingrained cultures, outdated technologies and poor logistics. There are a number of innovative projects within the UK, particularly at a local level, that pose the question as to whether bottom up approaches may be more successful than top down policies, as set by national and local government. This paper presents a case study demonstrating the former approach within the construction industry. Research and consultancy has been undertaken collaboratively between industry, academia and professional practice in the production of 15 individually designed sustainable dwellings in the North East of England. This project has employed Building Information Modelling (BIM) as a new collaborative working platform, aligned to the Modern Method of Construction (MMC). By situating this inquiry within an authentic case study it has highlighted ineffective strategies, policies and leadership, which have prevented full exploitation of the potential of BIM and MMC towards sustainable production. This inquiry supports the integration of the Framework for Sustainable Strategic Development (FSSD) into construction procurement, as a method for implementing bottom up leadership in a value driven project.",0,0,1

"A time-varying weights tuning method of the double EWMA controller
In recent years, the exponential-weighted-moving-average (EWMA) statistic based controllers are popular in semiconductor manufacturing. However, the single EWMA controller is not sufficient for compensating for the wear-out process. Thus, a double EWMA controller was proposed to enhance the capability for controlling the drifting process. In the literatures, in the solution of the double EWMA controller, only the ""trade-off"" solution weights are used to tune the controller. However, it is a fixed weight tuning method, and it is known that a time-varying weight will produce a superior performance over that of a fixed one (J. Quality Technol. 29 (1997) 184). Therefore, this study aims to develop a heuristic time-varying weights tuning method for the double EWMA controller. The numerical results showed that the proposed time-varying tuning method possesses an improvement of least 10% over that of the fixed weight scheme.",0,1,0
"Variant Management Solution for Large Scale Software Product Lines
Application lifecycle management for large scale software product lines (SPL) comes with the challenge to integrate distributed development activities across different parts of an organization and the engineering process in a tool landscape. Variant management is a cross-cutting concern that has interaction points with many of those integrated solutions. At Bosch, two different tools are used for variant management: pure::variants, a feature modeling tool for describing the feature-oriented product decomposition, and the custom tool MIC that offers a more comprehensive set of fine-grained variability management mechanisms. These include parameters, automated configurations or constraints. In turn, it is more suitable for component selection that is done close to the technology. In this experience report, we present a methodological approach on how to use the two tools with a technical integration solution we developed. Its purpose is to serve as an example for establishing successful variant management in large-scale product lines with respect to methodology and tools.",0,1,0
"Assessing multi-agent human-autonomy teams: US Army Robotic Wingman gunnery operations
The long-standing body of literature on human teams has provided an important foundation for understanding the core tenets that will structure and govern the dynamic human-autonomy teams of the future. The extant knowledge base highlights the importance of communication as a conduit for the development of teamwork states and processes such as shared situation awareness and appropriate team trust. However, the structure, roles, and interdependencies that will make up these future human-autonomy teams will inherently have marked differences in how they will operate, interact, and function. New metrics and assessment processes are needed to evaluate the interactions of these teams. Included in these needs are metrics of and standards for team performance, changes in team state measures (e.g., performance, stress, team cohesion, and trust), and evaluation of communication as it relates to the effectiveness of the team as a whole. In order to fully develop these metrics and assessments, coordination outside the laboratory environment with real-world autonomy-enabled systems is a critical next step. This paper provides a review of current processes recommended for assessing and evaluating teams, as well as the current limitations. The review is followed by a use case from a field study with the US Army Robotic Wingman program. This use case provides additional options for assessment protocols for human-autonomy team performance, team communication, and human state (including behavioral and physiological indicators) while operating in a real-world setting during gunnery operations. Overall, outcomes provide insight into future assessment procedures for future team crew station interaction with multiple robotic assets.",0,0,0
"Kernel-based adaptive multiple model target tracking
The novel adaptive multiple-model target tracking algorithm presented here employs a non-asymptotic state and parameter estimator whose design hinges on a non-standard integral system representation. The same estimator can be used for target maneuver detection and isolation and hence constitutes the principal ingredient of the tracking algorithm. The algorithm does not maintain a model bank, but creates and identifies new models in an attempt to best track the measurement data. Such an approach is rendered uniquely possible by the fact that the state and parameter estimator is essentially dead-beat. Practical model identifiability, persistent excitation condition for the measured signal are discussed. Although this first version of the algorithm is deterministic and employs threshold-based maneuver detection, it exhibits good robustness with respect to Gaussian measurement noise.",0,0,1
"Reliability Analysis of C4ISR Systems Based on Goal-Oriented Methodology
Hard-and-software integrated systems such as command and control systems (C4ISR systems) are typical systems that are comprised of both software and hardware, the failures of such devices result from complicated common cause failures and common (or shared) signals that make classical reliability analysis methods will be not applicable. To this end, this paper applies the Goal-Oriented (GO) methodology to detailed analyze the reliability of a C4ISR system. The reliability as well as the failure probability of the C4ISR system, are reached based on the GO model constructed. At the component level, the reliability of units of the C4ISR system is computed. Importance analysis of failures of such a system is completed by the qualitative analysis capability of the GO model, by which critical failures of hardware failures like communication module failures and motherboard module failures as well as software failures like network module application software failures and decompression module software failures are ascertained. This method of this paper contributes to the reliability analysis of all hard-and-software integrated systems.",0,0,1
"Input design for model order determination in subspace identification
Subspace identification methods require that the inputs to the process being identified be persistently exciting. This may be inadequate for subspace identification of ill-conditioned multivariable processes, because the process model order may be underestimated, leading to subsequent identification of poor models. To remedy the problem, it is proposed that inputs must be used that excite a process to be identified in a way that produces as uncorrelated process outputs as possible. This can be accomplished either in open or in closed-loop fashion. Simulations on a high-purity distillation column and on a heat exchanger illustrate the merit of the proposed approach.",0,1,1

"Transmission Ratio Design for Electric Vehicles via Analytical Modeling and optimization
In this paper we present an effective analytical modeling approach for the design of the transmission of electric vehicles. Specifically, we first devise an analytical loss model for an electric machine and show that it can be accurately fitted by only sampling three points from the original motor map. Second, we leverage this model to derive the optimal transmission ratio as a function of the wheels’ speed and torque, and use it to optimize the transmission ratio. Finally, we showcase our analytical approach with a real-world case-study comparing two different transmission technologies on a BMW i3: a fixed-gear transmission (FGT) and a continuously variable transmission (CVT). Our results show that even for e-machines intentionally designed for FGT, the implementation of a CVT can significantly improve their operational efficiency by more than 3%. The provided model will ultimately bridge the gap in understanding how to efficiently specify the e-machine and the transmission technology in an integrated fashion, and enable to effectively compare single- and multi-speed-based electric powertrains.",0,1,1
"3D DYNAMIC MODELING OF A SPHERICAL WHEELED SELF-BALANCING MOBILE ROBOT
3D DYNAMIC MODELING OF A SPHERICAL WHEELED SELF-BALANCING MOBILE ROBOT Ali Nail İNAL M.S. in Electrical and Electronics Engineering Supervisor: Prof. Dr. Ömer MORGÜL August 2012 In recent years, dynamically stable platforms that move on spherical wheels, also known as BallBots, gained popularity in the robotics literature as an alternative locomotion method to statically stable wheeled mobile robots. In contrast to wheeled platforms which do not have to explicitly be concerned about their balance, BallBot platforms must be informed about their dynamics and actively try to maintain balance. Up until now, such platforms have been approximated by simple planar models, with extensions to three dimensions through the combination of decoupled models in orthogonal sagittal planes. However, even though capturing certain aspects of the robot’s motion is possible with such decoupled models, they cannot represent inherently spatial aspects of motion such as yaw rotation or coupled inertial effects due to the motion of the rigid body. In this thesis, we introduce a novel, fully-coupled 3D model for such spherical wheeled balancing platforms. We show that our novel model captures important spatial aspects of motion that have previously not been captured by planar models. Moreover, our new model provides a better basis for controllers that",0,1,1
"A filter-based level set topology optimization method using a 62-line MATLAB code
The present paper proposes a fast and easy to implement level set topology optimization method that is able to adjust the complexity of resulting configurations. While the existing methods solve a large system of linear equations, the proposed method applies a density filter to the level set function in order to smoothen the optimized configurations. Considering the proposed method, the minimum total potential energy problem and optimum design problem of compliant mechanism will be studied in the present study. In topology optimization methods, the topological derivative determines the criteria of removing/adding material from/to the domain of definition of the problem. We utilize the definition of topological derivative to measure the sensitivity of a given objective function when an infinite small hole is inserted at an arbitrary location of the domain. It is shown that a first-order stress field appears in the topological derivative. Moreover, a comprehensive Airy stress function is proposed in order to solve the boundary value problem that governs the appeared first-order stress field. Finally, a simple MATLAB implementation is provided to confirm the effectiveness and utility of the proposed method.",0,0,1
"Autofocus survey: a comparison of algorithms
There are numerous passive contrast sensing autofocus algorithms that are well documented in literature, but some aspects of their comparative performance have not been widely researched. This study explores the relative merits of a set of autofocus algorithms via examining them against a variety of scene conditions. We create a statistics engine that considers a scene taken through a range of focal values and then computes the best focal position using each autofocus algorithm. The process is repeated across a survey of test scenes containing different representative conditions. The results are assessed against focal positions which are determined by manually focusing the scenes. Through examining these results, we then derive conclusions about the relative merits of each autofocus algorithm with respect to the criteria accuracy and unimodality. Our study concludes that the basic 2D spatial gradient measurement approaches yield the best autofocus results in terms of accuracy and unimodality.",0,1,0
"Hercules: An Autonomous Logistic Vehicle for Contact-less Goods Transportation During the COVID-19 Outbreak
Since December 2019, the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has spread rapidly across China. As at the date of writing this article, the disease has been globally reported in 100 countries, infected over 100,000 people and caused over 3,000 deaths. Avoiding person-to-person transmission is an effective approach to control and prevent the epidemic.

"An introduction to inertial navigation
Until recently the weight and size of inertial sensors has prohibited their use in domains such as human motion capture. Recent improvements in the performance of small and lightweight micromachined electromechanical systems (MEMS) inertial sensors have made the application of inertial techniques to such problems possible. This has resulted in an increased interest in the topic of inertial navigation, however current introductions to the subject fail to sufficiently describe the error characteristics of inertial systems. We introduce inertial navigation, focusing on strapdown systems based on MEMS devices. A combination of measurement and simulation is used to explore the error characteristics of such systems. For a simple inertial navigation system (INS) based on the Xsens Mtx inertial measurement unit (IMU), we show that the average error in position grows to over 150 m after 60 seconds of operation. The propagation of orientation errors caused by noise perturbing gyroscope signals is identified as the critical cause of such drift. By simulation we examine the significance of individual noise processes perturbing the gyroscope signals, identifying white noise as the process which contributes most to the overall drift of the system. Sensor fusion and domain specific constraints can be used to reduce drift in INSs. For an example INS we show that sensor fusion using magnetometers can reduce the average error in position obtained by the system after 60 seconds from over 150 m to around 5 m. We conclude that whilst MEMS IMU technology is rapidly improving, it is not yet possible to build a MEMS based INS which gives sub-meter position accuracy for more than one minute of operation.",0,1,1
"C-SL: Contrastive Sound Localization with Inertial-Acoustic Sensors
Human brain employs perceptual information about the head and eye movements to update the spatial relationship between the individual and the surrounding environment. Based on this cognitive process known as spatial updating, we introduce contrastive sound localization (C-SL) with mobile inertial-acoustic sensor arrays of arbitrary geometry. C-SL uses unlabeled multi-channel audio recordings and inertial measurement unit (IMU) readings collected during free rotational movements of the array to learn mappings from acoustical measurements to an array-centered direction-of-arrival (DOA) in a self-supervised manner. Contrary to conventional DOA estimation methods that require the knowledge of either the array geometry or source locations in the calibration stage, C-SL is agnostic to both, and can be trained on data collected in minimally constrained settings. To achieve this capability, our proposed method utilizes a customized contrastive loss measuring the spatial contrast between source locations predicted for disjoint segments of the input to jointly update estimated DOAs and the acoustic-spatial mapping in linear time. We provide quantitative and qualitative evaluations of C-SL comparing its performance with baseline DOA estimation methods in a wide range of conditions. We believe the relaxed calibration process offered by C-SL paves the way toward truly personalized augmented hearing applications.",0,0,1
"A Survey on Echo Chambers on Social Media: Description, Detection and Mitigation
Echo chambers on social media are a significant problem that can elicit a number of negative consequences, most recently affecting the response to COVID-19. Echo chambers promote conspiracy theories about the virus and are found to be linked to vaccine hesitancy, less compliance with mask mandates, and the practice of social distancing. Moreover, the problem of echo chambers is connected to other pertinent issues like political polarization and the spread of misinformation. An echo chamber is defined as a network of users in which users only interact with opinions that support their pre-existing beliefs and opinions, and they exclude and discredit other viewpoints. This survey aims to examine the echo chamber phenomenon on social media from a social computing perspective and provide a blueprint for possible solutions. We survey the related literature to understand the attributes of echo chambers and how they affect the individual and society at large. Additionally, we show the mechanisms, both algorithmic and psychological, that lead to the formation of echo chambers. These mechanisms could be manifested in two forms: (1) the bias of social media's recommender systems and (2) internal biases such as confirmation bias and homophily. While it is immensely challenging to mitigate internal biases, there has been great efforts seeking to mitigate the bias of recommender systems. These recommender systems take advantage of our own biases to personalize content recommendations to keep us engaged in order to watch more ads. Therefore, we further investigate different computational approaches for echo chamber detection and prevention, mainly based around recommender systems.",0,0,0

"Comfort-Oriented Design of Model Predictive Control in Assisted and Autonomous Driving

 This paper presents a method based on a Model Predictive Control (MPC) aiming to optimize the passenger comforts in assisted and autonomous vehicles. The controller works on the lateral and longitudinal dynamics of the car, providing front wheel steering angle and acceleration/deceleration command. The comfort is evaluated through two indexes extracted from the ISO 2631: an equivalent acceleration aeq and a Motion Sickness Dose Value (MSDV) index. The MPC weighting parameters are designed according to the values assumed by these indexes. Specifically, each weighting parameter is changed until the most satisfying comfort evaluation and the maximum vehicle performances, in terms of lateral deviation, tracking velocity and relative yaw angle, are reached. The controller is tested numerically on a simulated scenario resulting from real GPS data obtained in a highway.

"Power Delivery Network (PDN) Modeling for Backside-PDN Configurations With Buried Power Rails and $\mu$ TSVs
In this article, a power delivery network (PDN) modeling framework for backside-PDN configurations is presented. A backside-PDN configuration contains dense microthrough silicon vias ( $\mu $ TSVs) and power/ground metal stack on the backside of the die. This approach separates the PDN from a conventional signaling network of the back-end-of-the-line (BEOL) and improves power integrity and core utilization. We benchmark this technology with conventional front-side BEOL PDN configurations. Owing to the lower resistivity compared with Cu metal lines for advanced technology nodes, we use ruthenium (Ru)-based buried power rail for PDN modeling. Our analysis shows that the steady-state IR-drop reduces by more than $4\times $ in the backside-PDN configuration, and a simultaneous switching noise analysis shows a significant reduction in transient droops. The framework results are validated with a place-and-route (P&R)-based physical implementation flow. We quantify the area improvement in the actual flow and observe 25%–30% improvement in the backside-PDN configuration. From a PDN modeling framework, the PDN results follow a trend similar to the ones obtained from the block-level P&R of the given configurations. Moreover, we investigate the impacts of package-to-die interconnect pitch, metal–insulator–metal cap density, and input pulse on the PDN performance. In addition, we perform thermal modeling to analyze the thermal implications of the backside-PDN configuration. From a thermal modeling perspective, there is negligible influence from a dielectric bonding layer in the backside-PDN configuration.",0,1,1
"Methods for Advanced Wind Turbine Condition Monitoring and Early Diagnosis: A Literature Review
Condition monitoring and early fault diagnosis for wind turbines have become essential industry practice as they help improve wind farm reliability, overall performance and productivity.

Previous research on SRAM aging is based on transistor-level simulation or accelerated aging test at high temperature and voltage to observe aging effects within a short period of time. In contrast, we have run a long-term continuous power-up test on 16 Arduino Leonardo boards under nominal conditions for two years. In total, we collected around 175 million measurements for reliability, uniqueness and randomness evaluations. Analysis shows that the number of bits that flip with respect to the reference increased by 19.3% while min-entropy of SRAM PUF noise improves by 19.3% on average after two years of aging. The impact of aging on reliability is smaller under nominal conditions than was previously assessed by the accelerated aging test. The test we conduct in this work more closely resembles the conditions of a device in the field, and therefore we more accurately evaluate how silicon aging affects SRAM PUFs.",1,1,1
"Knocking and Combustion Noise Analysis
Knock is an abnormal and stochastic combustion phenomenon which needs detailed analysis because it governs the power density of engine, fuel consumption (engine efficiency), and engine durability, as well as noise and emission characteristics. Typically, compression ratio of spark ignition (SI) engine is limited by knock characteristics or knock propensity. This chapter discusses the knock fundamentals including modes of knock, onset of knock, characteristic knock frequencies, and super-knock. The super-knock is an extremely intense knock phenomenon which limits the engine turbocharging and downsizing proposed for improving the fuel conversion efficiency in SI engine. Accurate and repeatable measurement of engine knock is an important aspect of knock analysis and control. In-cylinder pressure-based techniques are considered as the most reliable method for knock detection; however, installation of pressure transducers in the combustion chamber is both difficult and expensive. This chapter presents the detailed cylinder pressure-based knock detection and analysis methods. Cylinder pressure- and heat release-based knock intensity indices (in time and frequency domain) along with their signal processing methods are discussed. Different methods of knock characterization/detection including statistical methods, stochastic method, and wavelets are also discussed. To fulfill the requirement of a low-cost and nonintrusive alternative method, knock detection using ion current sensors, engine vibrations, and microphones is used. Reduction of combustion noise is required as the part of engine development process due to customer demands. The multiple degrees of freedom in engine control and calibration provides more scope to influence combustion noise, which is required to be measured first, to control effectively. This chapter presents the discussion on the combustion noise estimation from the in-cylinder pressure measurements. Different combustion noise metrics are discussed along with their calculation algorithms and signal processing techniques.",0,0,1
"Derivation of drag and lift force and torque coefficients for non-spherical particles in flows
Abstract This paper derives and validates a new framework to predict the drag and lift coefficients as well as the torque coefficients for four non-spherical particle shapes in a flow with a wide range of flow Re and rotational Re numbers. Correlations are proposed for the drag force, the lift force, the pitching torque, and the torque caused by the rotation of the particle. Each of the correlations depends on Re number, the dimensionless rotation and the angle of incidence between the particle and the direction of the local fluid velocity. The fit parameters in the correlations for each of the particle shapes are determined by performing a large number of “true” DNS simulations of four different types of particles. The true DNS simulations are carried out with an improved mirroring immersed boundary method. The resulting correlations for the forces and the torques are suitable to be used in Eulerian–Lagrangian simulations, where an accurate prediction of the forces and torques is required to determine the motion of the particles.",0,0,1
"Trust in Smart Personal Assistants: A Systematic Literature Review and Development of a Research Agenda
Smart Personal Assistants (SPA) fundamentally influence the way individuals perform tasks, use services and interact with organizations. They thus bear an immense economic and societal potential. However, a lack of trust - rooted in perceptions of uncertainty and risk - when interacting with intelligent computer agents can inhibit their adoption. In this paper, we conduct a systematic literature review to investigate the state of knowledge on trust in SPAs. Based on a concept-centric analysis of 50 papers, we derive three distinct research perspectives that constitute this nascent field: user interface-driven, interaction-driven, and explanation-driven trust in SPAs. Building on the results of our analysis, we develop a research agenda to spark and guide future research surrounding trust in SPAs. Ultimately, this paper intends to contribute to the body of knowledge of trust in artificial intelligence-based systems, specifically SPAs.

"Topology optimization for transient response of structures subjected to dynamic loads
This paper presents a topology optimization framework for structural problems subjected to transient loading. The mechanical model assumes a linear elastic isotropic material, infinitesimal strains, and a dynamic response. The optimization problem is solved using the gradient-based optimizer Method of Moving Asymptotes (MMA) with time-dependent sensitivities provided via the adjoint method. The stiffness of materials is interpolated using the Solid Isotropic Material with Penalization (SIMP) method and the Heaviside Projection Method (HPM) is used to stabilize the problem numerically and improve the manufacturability of the topology-optimized designs. Both static and dynamic optimization examples are considered here.

"DPT-FSNet: Dual-Path Transformer Based Full-Band and Sub-Band Fusion Network for Speech Enhancement
Sub-band models have achieved promising results due to their ability to model local patterns in the spectrogram. Some studies further improve the performance by fusing sub-band and full-band information. However, the structure for the full-band and sub-band fusion model was not fully explored. This paper proposes a dual-path transformer-based full-band and sub-band fusion network (DPT-FSNet) for speech enhancement in the frequency domain.

Experimental results show that the proposed method outperforms the current state-of-the-art.",1,1,0
"Prediction of geological conditions for a tunnel boring machine using big operational data
Abstract This paper presents a comprehensive procedure to predict geological conditions (i.e., rock mass types) for a tunneling boring machine (TBM) based on big operational data including four channels: cutterhead speed, cutterhead torque, thrust, and advance rate. To handle the big operational data, a Balanced Iterative Reducing and Clustering using Hierarchies (BIRCH) algorithm is adopted to effectively compress 12,038,636 TBM operational data to only 5014 leaf node entries. A K-means++ algorithm is used to find potential rock mass types in the TBM operational data. By comparing three kinds of classifiers, a support vector classifier (SVC) with an average precision of 98.6% is selected as the best geological conditions prediction model. Test results on historical TBM operational segments show that most adjacent operational segments have the same rock mass type. The change in rock mass type is a dynamic process, which first fluctuates between two rock mass types and gradually stabilizes at the latter type. In addition, the cutterhead torque and thrust are found to better reflect the change of rock mass types compared with the advance rate and cutterhead speed. Test results on a water conveyance tunnel show that using only 20% of TBM training data the developed prediction model can generate 84.4% precision and 88.8% recall performance for the remaining 80% testing data. Hence, the proposed procedure could be applied to big TBM operational data to accurately detect, characterize, and predict rock mass types, which is of critical importance to safe and efficient tunneling.",0,0,1

"Numerical investigations of heat transfer and pressure drop characteristics in multiple jet impingement system
Abstract Jet impingement is one of the best methods for achieving high heat transfer coefficient in single phase and has been a topic of active research for several decades, involving both experiments and computations. Most of the research on multiple jets have been carried out for an array of jets in the high Reynolds number regime. To increase the application of jet impingement in micro turbines, cooling of electronic chips, etc., the current paper discusses the physics of impinging jets in large array in low Reynolds number regime. Furthermore, the pressure drop incurred in impinging jets has not been addressed in the open literature and the current paper provides some vital insights into the pressure drop characteristics. Numerical simulations are carried out on an array of impinging jets using various approaches such as Reynolds averaged Navier-Stokes (RANS) and Large Eddy Simulations (LES). The results obtained from these simulations are validated with the experimental results. LES simulations have been carried out to get a better understanding of the flow physics in multiple jet impingement array. The simulations show that the major pressure loss in the system is due to contraction effect at the nozzle entrance and due to viscous losses. Furthermore, simulations have been carried out to establish the sensitivity of the pressure drop and heat transfer characteristics to the manufacturing tolerances expected in practical engineering applications of these jet arrays.",0,1,1
"Robust adaptive sliding-mode control of condenser-cleaning mobile manipulator using fuzzy wavelet neural network
This paper presents a robust adaptive sliding-mode control (RASMC) scheme for a class of condenser-cleaning mobile manipulator (CCMM) in the presence of parametric uncertainties and external disturbances. The development of control system is based on the fuzzy wavelet neural network (FWNN). First, a dynamic model is obtained in view of the practical CCMM system. Second, the FWNN is used to identify the unstructured system dynamics directly due to its ability to approximate a nonlinear continuous function to arbitrary accuracy. Using learning ability of neural networks, RASMC can coordinately control the condenser-cleaning mobile platform and the mounted manipulator with different dynamics efficiently. The implementation of the control algorithm is dependent on the adaptive sliding-mode control. Finally, based on the Lyapunov stability theory, the stability of the whole control system, the boundedness of the neural networks weight estimation errors, and the uniformly ultimately boundedness of the tracking error are all strictly guaranteed. Moreover, simulation results validate the superior control performance of the proposed adaptive control method.",0,1,1
"Sparse array extension for non-circular signals with subspace and compressive sensing based DOA estimation methods
Abstract The virtual array generation process based on typical sparse arrays is studied for a mixture of circular and non-circular impinging signals. It consists of two sub-arrays: one is the traditional difference co-array and the other one is the new sum co-array. The number of consecutive virtual array sensors is analysed for the nested array case, but it is difficult to give a closed-form result for a general sparse array. Based on the extended covariance matrix of the physical array, two classes of direction of arrival (DOA) estimation algorithms are then developed, with one based on the subspace method and one based on sparse representation or the compressive sensing (CS) concept. Both the consecutive and non-consecutive parts of the virtual array can be exploited by the CS-based method, while only the consecutive part can be exploited by the subspace-based one. As a result, the CS-based solution can have a better performance than the subspace-based one, though at the cost of significantly increased computational complexity. The two classes of algorithms can also deal with the special case when all the signals are noncircular. Simulation results are provided to verify the performance of the proposed algorithms.",0,0,1
"Hotword Cleaner: Dual-microphone Adaptive Noise Cancellation with Deferred Filter Coefficients for Robust Keyword Spotting
This paper presents a novel dual-microphone speech enhancement algorithm to improve noise robustness of hotword (wake-word) detection as a special application of keyword spotting. It exploits two unique properties of hotwords: they are leading phrases of valid voice queries that we intend to respond and have short durations. Consequently an STFT-based adaptive noise cancellation method modified to use deferred filter coefficients is proposed to extract hotwords out from noisy stereo microphone signals. The new algorithm is tested with two considerably different neural hotword detectors. Both systems have significantly reduced the false-reject rate when background has strong TV noise.",0,0,1

"Disruptive Technologies: An Expanded View
The term ""disruptive technology"" as coined by Christensen (1997, The Innovator's Dilemma; How New Technologies Cause Great Firms to Fail. Harvard Business School Press) refers to a new technology having lower cost and performance measured by traditional criteria, but having higher ancillary performance. Christensen finds that disruptive technologies may enter and expand emerging market niches, improving with time and ultimately attacking established products in their traditional markets. This conception, while useful, is also limiting in several important ways.By emphasising only ""attack from below"" Christensen ignores other discontinuous patterns of change, which may be of equal or greater importance (Utterback, 1994, Mastering the Dynamics of Innovation. Harvard Business School Press; Acee, 2001, SM Thesis, Massachusetts Institute of Technology). Further, the true importance of disruptive technology, even in Christensen's conception of it is not that it may displace established products. Rather, it is a powerful means for enlarging and broadening markets and providing new functionality.In Christensen's theory of disruptive technology, the establishment of a new market segment acts to channel the new product to the leading edge of the market or the early adopters. Once the innovation reaches the early to late majority of users it begins to compete with the established product in its traditional market. Here we present an alternative scenario in which a higher performing and higher priced innovation is introduced into the most demanding established market segments and later moves towards the mass market.",0,1,0
"A constraint programming approach for a batch processing problem with non-identical job sizes
This paper presents a constraint programming approach for a batch processing machine on which a finite number of jobs of non-identical sizes must be scheduled. A parallel batch processing machine can process several jobs simultaneously and the objective is to minimize the maximal lateness. The constraint programming formulation proposed relies on the decomposition of the problem into finding an assignment of the jobs to the batches, and then minimizing the lateness of the batches on a single machine. This formulation is enhanced by a new optimization constraint which is based on a relaxed problem and applies cost-based domain filtering techniques. Experimental results demonstrate the efficiency of cost-based domain filtering techniques. Comparisons to other exact approaches clearly show the benefits of the proposed approach: it can optimally solve problems that are one order of magnitude greater than those solved by a mathematical formulation or by a branch-and-price.",0,0,0
"Safety-Critical Systems and Agile Development: A Mapping Study
In the last decades, agile methods had a huge impact on how software is developed. In many cases, this has led to significant benefits, such as quality and speed of software deliveries to customers. However, safety-critical systems have widely been dismissed from benefiting from agile methods. Products that include safety critical aspects are therefore faced with a situation in which the development of safety-critical parts can significantly limit the potential speed-up through agile methods, for the full product, but also in the non-safety critical parts. For such products, the ability to develop safety-critical software in an agile way will generate a competitive advantage. In order to enable future research in this important area, we present in this paper a mapping of the current state of practice based on a mixed method approach. Starting from a workshop with experts from six large Swedish product development companies we develop a lens for our analysis. We then present a systematic mapping study on safety-critical systems and agile development through this lens in order to map potential benefits, challenges, and solution candidates for guiding future research.",1,0,0

"Sensitivity analysis based multi-scale methods of coupled path-dependent problems
In the paper, a generalized essential boundary condition sensitivity analysis based implementation of $$\text {FE}^2$$ FE 2 and mesh-in-element (MIEL) multi-scale methods is derived as an alternative to standard implementations of multi-scale analysis, where the calculation of Schur complement of the microscopic tangent matrix is needed for bridging the scales. The paper presents a unified approach to the development of an arbitrary MIEL or $$\text {FE}^2$$ FE 2 computational scheme for an arbitrary path-dependent material model. Implementation is based on efficient first and second order analytical sensitivity analysis, for which automatic-differentiation-based formulation of essential boundary condition sensitivity analysis is derived. A fully consistently linearized two-level path-following algorithm is introduced as a solution algorithm for the multi-scale modeling. Sensitivity analysis allows each macro step to be followed by an arbitrary number of micro substeps while retaining quadratic convergence of the overall solution algorithm.",0,0,1

"Dynamical Analysis of Friction Induced Vibration in a Precision Motion Stage with a Friction Isolator
Motion stages are widely used for precision positioning in manufacturing and metrology applications. However, nonlinear pre-motion friction can significantly affect their control performance and accuracy. This paper analytically studies the dynamical effect of a friction isolator (FI) proposed in previous studies, in which the beneficial effects of FI on improving the robustness, speed, and precision of the system have been experimentally demonstrated. A fundamental understanding of the dynamical effects of FI is achieved by applying linear analysis on a motion stage with and without FI under the effect of LuGre friction dynamics. The systems are studied with the implementation of PID controllers, which, in terms of practicability in motion control, provide more general observations than when only PD is implemented. Parametric analysis is carried out on the effect of control gains, FI design parameters, and LuGre friction parameters to thoroughly observe the eigenvalue and stability characteristics. Numerical simulation is then established to validate the analytical results and demonstrate the interesting dynamical phenomena with the involvement of LuGre friction, PID control, and the friction isolator in the motion stage system. Based on the results, fundamental analytical conclusions about the FI are reached, which also pave the road for future nonlinear studies.",0,0,1
"Feature-Level Rating System Using Customer Reviews and Review Votes
This work studies how we can obtain feature-level ratings of the mobile products from the customer reviews and review votes to influence decision-making, both for new customers and manufacturers. Such a rating system gives a more comprehensive picture of the product than what a product-level rating system offers. While product-level ratings are too generic, feature-level ratings are particular; we exactly know what is good or bad about the product. There has always been a need to know which features fall short or are doing well according to the customer’s perception. It keeps both the manufacturer and the customer well-informed in the decisions to make in improving the product and buying, respectively. Different customers are interested in different features. Thus, feature-level ratings can make buying decisions personalized. We analyze the customer reviews collected on an online shopping site (Amazon) about various mobile products and the review votes. Explicitly, we carry out a feature-focused sentiment analysis for this purpose. Eventually, our analysis yields ratings to 108 features for 4000+ mobiles sold online. It helps in decision-making on how to improve the product (from the manufacturer’s perspective) and in making the personalized buying decisions (from the buyer’s perspective) a possibility.

"Gig-workers’ motivation: thinking beyond carrots and sticks

Purpose
High-quality employee motivation can contribute to an organization’s long-term success by supporting employees’ well-being and performance. Nevertheless, there is a paucity of research concerning how organizations motivate workers in non-traditional work contexts. In the algocratic context of the gig-economy, the purpose of this paper is to understand the role that technology can play in motivating workers.


Design/methodology/approach
Drawing on the self-determination theory, job-characteristic theory and enterprise social media research, this conceptual paper explores how the architecture of the digital labor platforms underlying the gig-economy (and the characteristics of jobs mediated through these IT artifacts) can impact key antecedents of self-motivation.


Findings
Combining theory and empirical evidence, this paper develops a mid-range theory demonstrating how organizations can support the self-motivation of gig-workers through the thoughtful design of their digital labor platforms and the integration of two social media tools (namely, social networking and social badging).


Research limitations/implications
This paper answers calls for psychologically-based research exploring the consequences of gig-work as well as research studying the impacts of advanced technologies in interaction with work contexts on motivation. In theorizing around a large set of social-contextual variables operating at different levels of analysis, this paper demonstrates that individual-level motivation can be influenced by both task-based and organizational-level factors, in addition to individual-level factors.


Originality/value
The proposed theory provides novel insight into how gig-organizations can leverage widely accessible social media technology to motivate platform workers in the absence of human supervision and support. Theoretical and practical implications are discussed.

"A State-Independent Linear Power Flow Model With Accurate Estimation of Voltage Magnitude
Linearized power flow models are of great interest in power system studies such as contingency analyses and reliability assessments, especially for large-scale systems. One of the most popular models—the classical DC power flow model—is widely used and praised for its state independence, robustness, and computational efficiency. Despite its advantages, however, the DC power flow model fails to consider reactive power or bus voltage magnitude. This paper closes this gap by proposing a decoupled linearized power flow (DLPF) model with respect to voltage magnitude and phase angle. The model is state independent but is distinguished by its high accuracy in voltage magnitude. Moreover, this paper presents an in-depth analysis of the DLPF model with the purpose of accelerating its computation speed, leading to the fast DLPF (FDLPF) model. The approximation that is applied to obtain the FDLPF model from the DLPF model is justified by a theoretical derivation and numerical tests. The proposed methods are provably accurate and robust for several cases, including radial distribution systems, meshed large-scale transmission systems and ill-conditioned systems. Finally, expressions for sensitivity with regard to MW flow and bus voltage are provided as a potential application.",0,1,1
"Board age and corporate financial fraud: An interactionist view
Abstract Unlike past studies which have focused on either executives or boards of directors, this study takes an interactionist view to investigate the determinants of corporate financial fraud. We propose that CEOs evaluate the opportunities for financial fraud according to both situational stimuli and their own personal characteristics. As older directors are often more experienced and have more to lose if they fail in their monitoring duties, we expect them to be more capable and to have stronger motivation for monitoring CEOs closely. As such, we propose that a CEO is less likely to engage in corporate financial fraud when the average age of the board of directors increases (i.e., board age). However, when the CEO is older than the board, the CEO may attach less importance to board age when deciding whether to commit fraud. Therefore, we further propose that the CEO–board directional age difference can weaken the effect of board age. Our empirical analyses provide strong support for these hypotheses. Our study contributes to the literature on corporate governance by highlighting the often neglected roles of board age and CEO–board directional age difference in deterring corporate financial fraud.",0,0,0
"Instafamous and social media influencer marketing

Purpose
The purpose of this paper is to test the effects of two types of celebrities (Instagram celebrity vs traditional celebrity) on source trustworthiness, brand attitude, envy and social presence. The proposed theoretical model consists of the celebrity type as the independent variable, social presence as the mediator and self-discrepancy as the moderator.


Design/methodology/approach
A randomized two-group comparison (Instagram celebrity vs traditional celebrity) between-subjects experiment (n=104) was conducted.


Findings
The results indicate that consumers exposed to Instagram celebrity’s brand posts perceive the source to be more trustworthy, show more positive attitude toward the endorsed brand, feel stronger social presence and feel more envious of the source than those consumers exposed to traditional celebrity’s brand posts. Structural equation modeling (Mplus 8.0) and bootstrap confidence intervals indicate that social presence mediates the causal effects of celebrity type on trustworthiness, brand attitude and envy. Multiple regression analyses reveal the moderating effects of appearance-related actual–ideal self-discrepancy.


Practical implications
Ultimately, managerial implications for social media marketing and Instagram influencer-based branding are provided. From the perspective of marketing planning, the findings speak to the power of influencer marketing as an effective branding strategy.

"Multi-joint soft exosuit for gait assistance
Exosuits represent a new approach for applying assistive forces to an individual, using soft textiles to interface to the wearer and transmit forces through specified load paths. In this paper we present a body-worn, multi-joint soft exosuit that assists both ankle plantar flexion and hip flexion through a multiarticular load path, and hip extension through a separate load path, at walking speeds up to 1.79m/s (4.0mph). The exosuit applies forces of 300N in the multiarticular load path and 150N in hip extension, which correspond to torques of 21% and 19% of the nominal biological moments at the ankle and hip during unloaded walking. The multi-joint soft exosuit uses a new actuation approach that exploits joint synergies, with one motor actuating the multiarticular load paths on both legs and one motor actuating the hip extension load paths on both legs, in order to reduce the total system weight. Control is accomplished by an algorithm that uses only a gyroscope at the heel and a load cell monitoring the suit tension, and is shown to adapt within a single step to changes in cadence. Additionally, the control algorithm can create slack in the suit during non-level-ground walking motions such as stepping over obstacles so that the system can be transparent to the wearer when required.

"Filling and Planarizing Deep Trenches with Polymeric Material for Through-Silicon Via Technology
A key driver for 3-D device integration has been through-silicon via (TSV) technology that enables through-chip communication between vertically integrated layers. The TSVs typically have an electrical isolation using a dielectric layer between the silicon and the interconnect metal (e.g., copper). Recently, polymers have been proposed for use as the dielectric isolation layer, and polymers have been shown to increase device reliability by reducing “copper pumping,' where copper pops out from the TSV holes during thermal cycling. Traditionally, spinor spray-coating techniques have been used to fill TSVs with polymer material. However, using those techniques to fill and planarize very deep trenches (∼ 400 μm) and high-aspect-ratio structures has many limitations and usually results in voids, nonplanar surfaces, and lack of polymer flow to the requisite depths.

"A Machine Learning Approach to Optimal Inverse Discrete Cosine Transform (IDCT) Design
The design of the optimal inverse discrete cosine transform (IDCT) to compensate the quantization error is proposed for effective lossy image compression in this work. The forward and inverse DCTs are designed in pair in current image/video coding standards without taking the quantization effect into account. Yet, the distribution of quantized DCT coefficients deviate from that of original DCT coefficients. This is particularly obvious when the quality factor of JPEG compressed images is small. To address this problem, we first use a set of training images to learn the compound effect of forward DCT, quantization and dequantization in cascade. Then, a new IDCT kernel is learned to reverse the effect of such a pipeline. Experiments are conducted to demonstrate that the advantage of the new method, which has a gain of 0.11-0.30dB over the standard JPEG over a wide range of quality factors.",1,1,1
"A first look at developers’ live chat on Gitter
Modern communication platforms such as Gitter and Slack play an increasingly critical role in supporting software teamwork, especially in open source development.Conversations on such platforms often contain intensive, valuable information that may be used for better understanding OSS developer communication and collaboration. However, little work has been done in this regard. To bridge the gap, this paper reports a first comprehensive empirical study on developers' live chat, investigating when they interact, what community structures look like, which topics are discussed, and how they interact. We manually analyze 749 dialogs in the first phase, followed by an automated analysis of over 173K dialogs in the second phase. We find that developers tend to converse more often on weekdays, especially on Wednesdays and Thursdays (UTC), that there are three common community structures observed, that developers tend to discuss topics such as API usages and errors, and that six dialog interaction patterns are identified in the live chat communities. Based on the findings, we provide recommendations for individual developers and OSS communities, highlight desired features for platform vendors, and shed light on future research directions. We believe that the findings and insights will enable a better understanding of developers' live chat, pave the way for other researchers, as well as a better utilization and mining of knowledge embedded in the massive chat history.",0,1,0

LONGITUDINAL CRACKING IS SOMETIMES FOUND ON THE THICKER SLAB-TYPE BRIDGES AND APPARENTLY RESULTS FROM SUBSIDENCE OF HIGH SLUMP CONCRETE AROUND THE REINFORCING BARS. TRANSVERSE CRACKING IS THE FORM MOST OFTEN ENCOUNTERED. SHRINKAGE AND THERMAL VOLUME CHANGES IN THE CONCRETE APPARENTLY ARE THE PRIMARY FACTORS PRODUCING THESE CRACKS. SURFACE SPALLING, A MAJOR PROBLEM IN SOME STATES, IS THE RESULT OF INTERNAL EXPANSIVE FORCES IN THE CONCRETE GENERATED BY THE CORROSION OF TOP REINFORCING BARS. CRACKS OVER BARS, SHALLOW CONCRETE COVER OVER BARS, AND PERMEABLE CONCRETE ALLOW THE DE-ICING CHEMICAL SOLUTIONS TO REACH THE BARS AND CAUSE THE CORROSION. RECOMMENDATIONS FOR IMPROVED DURABILITY INVOLVE THE USE OF HIGHER QUALITY CONCRETES, IMPROVED CONSTRUCTION PRACTICES, AND ATTENTION TO DESIGN DETAILS THAT HAVE AN INFLUENCE ON DURABILITY. ATTENTION IS ALSO INVITED TO 2- COURSE BONDED CONSTRUCTION (SUCH AS IS USED FOR INDUSTRIAL FLOOR CONSTRUCTION) AS AN ALTERNATIVE TO SINGLE COURSE BRIDGE DECK CONSTRUCTION. /AUTHOR/",0,1,1
"Enhanced particle filtration in straight microchannels using shear-modulated inertial migration
In this work, we introduce a novel method for enhanced particle filtration using shear-modulated inertial migration in straight microchannels. Depending on their size, inertial lift causes particles to migrate toward microchannel walls. Using microchannels with high aspect ratio cross sections, the fluidic shear can be modulated, resulting in preferential equilibration of particles along the longer microchannel walls. Due to large lift forces generated in these high aspect ratio channels, complete particle filtration can be achieved in short distances even at low flow rates (Re<50). Based on this principle, we use a straight microfluidic channel with a rectangular cross section to passively and continuously filter 1.9 μm polystyrene particles. Overall, the proposed technique is versatile and can be easily integrated with on-chip microfluidic systems for filtration of a wide range of particle sizes, from micro- to nanoparticles.",0,0,1
"Fabrication of biomimetic slippery liquid‐infused porous surface on 5086 aluminum alloy with excellent antifouling performance
Biofouling triggers extensive research in ship tribology. Antifouling technology has garnered great attention as a solution for biofouling; thus, biomimetic lubricant‐infused surfaces are developed as alternatives to superhydrophobic surfaces. In this study, we developed slippery liquid‐infused porous surfaces (SLIPS) by infusing perfluoropolyether oil into porous anodic aluminum oxide (AAO) surfaces using a vacuum impregnation device. The oil settled firmly in the AAO surfaces owing to the strong capillary forces in the pores, thus forming a lubricating layer with a low contact angle hysteresis and long‐term slippery condition. SLIPS exhibited an excellent antifouling performance by reducing 98.4% of Phaeodactylum tricornutum. The coefficient of biofilm formed by the microorganisms was also investigated. The results confirmed that the lubricating layer impeded the formation of biofilm. This research provides valuable information for the fabrication of SLIPS and its antifouling mechanism.",0,1,1
"Pushing The Limit of Type I Codebook For Fdd Massive Mimo Beamforming: A Channel Covariance Reconstruction Approach
There is a fundamental trade-off between the channel representation resolution of codebooks and the overheads of feedback communications in the fifth generation new radio (5G NR) frequency division duplex (FDD) massive multiple-input and multiple-output (MIMO) systems. In particular, two types of codebooks (namely Type I and Type II codebooks) are introduced with different resolution and overhead. Although the Type I codebook based scheme requires lower feedback overhead, its channel state information (CSI) reconstruction and beamforming performance are not as good as those from the Type II codebook based scheme. However, since the Type I codebook based scheme has been widely used in 4G systems for many years, replacing it by the Type II codebook based scheme overnight is too costly to be an option. Therefore, in this paper, using Type I codebook, we leverage advances in cutting plane method to optimize the CSI reconstruction at the base station (BS), in order to close the gap between these two codebook based beamforming schemes. Numerical results based on channel samples from QUAsi Deterministic RadIo channel GenerAtor (QuaDRiGa) are presented to show the excellent performance of the proposed algorithm in terms of beamforming vector acquisition.",0,0,0
"Dynamic stall experiments on the NACA 0012 airfoil
The flow over a NACA 0012 airfoil undergoing large oscillations in pitch was experimentally studied at a Reynolds number of and over a range of frequencies and amplitudes. Hot-wire probes and surface-pressure transducers were used to clarify the role of the laminar separation bubble, to delineate the growth and shedding of the stall vortex, and to quantify the resultant aerodynamic loads. In addition to the pressure distributions and normal force and pitching moment data that have often been obtained in previous investigations, estimates of the unsteady drag force during dynamic stall have been derived from the surface pressure measurements. Special characteristics of the pressure response, which are symptomatic of the occurrence and relative severity of moment stall, have also been examined.",0,1,1
"Optimum Filters for the Detection of Signals in Noise
A detection system usually contains a predetection filter whose function is to enhance the strength of the signal relative to that of the noise. An optimum predetection filter is defined in this paper as one which maximizes the ""distance"" between the signal and noise components of the output (subject to a constraint on the noise compgnent) in terms of a suitable distance function d(x, y). In a special case, this definition leads to the criterion used by North, and yields filters which maximize the signal-to-noise ratio at a specified instant of time. North's theory of such filters is extended to the case of nonwhite noise and finite memory (i.e., finite observation time) filters. Explicit expressions for the impulsive responses of such filters are developed, and two examples of practical interest are considered.",0,0,1
"Dynamic locomotion for passive-ankle biped robots and humanoids using whole-body locomotion control
Whole-body control (WBC) is a generic task-oriented control method for feedback control of loco-manipulation behaviors in humanoid robots. The combination of WBC and model-based walking controllers has been widely utilized in various humanoid robots. However, to date, the WBC method has not been employed for unsupported passive-ankle dynamic locomotion. As such, in this article, we devise a new WBC, dubbed the whole-body locomotion controller (WBLC), that can achieve experimental dynamic walking on unsupported passive-ankle biped robots. A key aspect of WBLC is the relaxation of contact constraints such that the control commands produce reduced jerk when switching foot contacts. To achieve robust dynamic locomotion, we conduct an in-depth analysis of uncertainty for our dynamic walking algorithm called the time-to-velocity-reversal (TVR) planner. The uncertainty study is fundamental as it allows us to improve the control algorithms and mechanical structure of our robot to fulfill the tolerated uncertainty. In addition, we conduct extensive experimentation for: (1) unsupported dynamic balancing (i.e., in-place stepping) with a six-degree-of-freedom biped, Mercury; (2) unsupported directional walking with Mercury; (3) walking over an irregular and slippery terrain with Mercury; and 4) in-place walking with our newly designed ten-DoF viscoelastic liquid-cooled biped, DRACO. Overall, the main contributions of this work are on: (a) achieving various modalities of unsupported dynamic locomotion of passive-ankle bipeds using a WBLC controller and a TVR planner; (b) conducting an uncertainty analysis to improve the mechanical structure and the controllers of Mercury; and (c) devising a whole-body control strategy that reduces movement jerk during walking.",0,0,1
"Batching and Matching for Food Delivery in Dynamic Road Networks
Given a stream of food orders and available delivery vehicles, how should orders be assigned to vehicles so that the delivery time is minimized? For a successful assignment strategy, two key decisions need to be made: (1) assignment of orders to vehicles, (2) grouping orders into batches to cope with limited vehicle availability. We show that the minimization problem is not only NP-hard but inapproximable in polynomial time. To mitigate this computational bottleneck, we develop an algorithm called FOODMATCH, which maps the vehicle assignment problem to that of minimum weight perfect matching on a bipartite graph. The solution quality is further enhanced by reducing batching to a graph clustering problem. Extensive experiments on food-delivery data from large metropolitan cities establish that FOODMATCH is substantially better than baseline strategies on a number of metrics.",0,1,0
"A Hybrid Supplier Selection Approach Using Machine Learning and Data Envelopment Analysis
Although supplier selection is an old topic in operations management, newer methods developed to improve the existing procedures day by day. With the rise of artificial intelligence, recent forms of supplier selection criteria, such as DEA (Data Envelopment Analysis), can be paired with specific machine learning algorithms to yield performance efficiencies or decisions that are accurate, as the relative efficiency results from the DEA method alone are dependent on the number of observations; as a result, repeating the operation whenever new suppliers are added is time-consuming. In this paper, specific machine learning algorithms used for classification are applied to the DEA results, and their respective accuracy are compared using the confusion matrix. The findings show that the decision tree was much more accurate than the Kernel SVM and Logistic Regression. This paper has thus focused on creating a hybrid model for supplier selection by combining the DEA method and machine learning algorithms.",0,0,0

"Moderation Challenges in Voice-based Online Communities on Discord
Online community moderators are on the front lines of combating problems like hate speech and harassment, but new modes of interaction can introduce unexpected challenges. In this paper, we consider moderation practices and challenges in the context of real-time, voice-based communication through 25 in-depth interviews with moderators on Discord. Our findings suggest that the affordances of voice-based online communities change what it means to moderate content and interactions. Not only are there new ways to break rules that moderators of text-based communities find unfamiliar, such as disruptive noise and voice raiding, but acquiring evidence of rule-breaking behaviors is also more difficult due to the ephemerality of real-time voice. While moderators have developed new moderation strategies, these strategies are limited and often based on hearsay and first impressions, resulting in problems ranging from unsuccessful moderation to false accusations. Based on these findings, we discuss how voice communication complicates current understandings and assumptions about moderation, and outline ways that platform designers and administrators can design technology to facilitate moderation.",0,0,0
"Measuring intellectual capital: a new model and empirical study
The groundwork of intellectual capital (IC) management, measuring IC, attracts much attention from academics and practitioners. The purpose of this paper is to design a measurement model and a qualitative index system of IC, so as to provide a good tool for enterprises to manage their IC. Based on a review of several IC measurement models proposed by western researchers, IC is classified into human capital, structural capital, innovation capital and customer capital, and thereupon a qualitative index system for the above four IC elements is designed through an analysis of their contents. Through an empirical study, it is found that there is a significant relationship between the scores of the four IC elements of a company and its business performance, which proves the validity and rationality of the IC measurement model and the qualitative index system. In the meantime, the empirical study further proves that there is a remarkable relationship between the four IC elements.

"Accurate fault locator for EHV transmission lines based on radial basis function neural networks
Abstract This paper describes the design and implementation of an artificial neural networks-based fault locator for extra high voltage (EHV) transmission lines. This locator utilizes faulted voltage and current waveforms at one end of the line only. The radial basis function (RBF) networks are trained with data under a variety of fault conditions and used for fault type classification and fault location on the transmission line. The results obtained from testing of RBF networks with simulated fault data and recorded data from a 400 kV system clearly show that this technique is highly robust and very accurate. The technique takes into account all the practical limitations associated with a real system. Thereby making it possible to effectively implement an artificial intelligence (AI) based fault locator on a real system.",0,0,1
"An AOA and Orientation Angle-Based Localization Algorithm for Passive RFID Tag Array
This paper proposes an indoor localization algorithm based on AOA (Arrive of Angle) and orientation angle (OA) for passive UHF RFID (Ultra-High Frequency Radio Frequency Identification) tag array. By utilizing a uniform linear tag array (ULA), the AOA, which is defined as the angle of the reader relative to the tag array, can be estimated by the Multiple Signal Classification (MUSIC) algorithm. The relationship between AOA, OA of the tag array, and the direction angle (DA) between each reader antenna to the geometric center of the tag array is analyzed, and an OA retrieval method based on rotating the coordinate system is proposed to calculate DA. The tag array localization is finally acquired by the DA of each antenna. Simulation and experiment results show that the proposed algorithm can achieve decimeter-level localization accuracy. The proposed algorithm achieves a mean accuracy of 0.216 m, which is a significant improvement compared with the traditional AOA localization algorithm.",0,1,0
"A Holistic Motion Planning and Control Solution to Challenge a Professional Racecar Driver
We present a holistically designed three layer control architecture capable of outperforming a professional driver racing the same car. Our approach focuses on the co-design of the motion planning and control layers, extracting the full potential of the connected system. First, a high-level planner computes an optimal trajectory around the track, then in real-time a mid-level nonlinear model predictive controller follows this path using the high-level information as guidance. Finally a high frequency, low-level controller tracks the states predicted by the mid-level controller. Tracking the predicted behavior has two advantages: it reduces the mismatch between the model used in the upper layers and the real car, and allows for a torque vectoring command to be optimized by the higher level motion planners. The tailored design of the low-level controller proved to be crucial for bridging the gap between planning and control, unlocking unseen performance in autonomous racing. The proposed approach was verified on a full size racecar, considerably improving over the state-of-the-art results achieved on the same vehicle. Finally, we also show that the proposed co-design approach outperforms a professional racecar driver.",0,0,1
"Velocity Obstacle-Based Collision Avoidance and Motion Planning Framework for Connected and Automated Vehicles
This study proposes a novel collision avoidance and motion planning framework for connected and automated vehicles based on an improved velocity obstacle (VO) method. The controller framework consists of two parts, that is, collision avoidance method and motion planning algorithm. The VO algorithm is introduced to deduce the velocity conditions of a vehicle collision. A collision risk potential field (CRPF) is constructed to modify the collision area calculated by the VO algorithm. A vehicle dynamic model is presented to predict vehicle moving states and trajectories. A model predictive control (MPC)-based motion tracking controller is employed to plan collision-avoidance path according to the collision-free principles deduced by the modified VO method. Five simulation scenarios are designed and conducted to demonstrate the control maneuver of the proposed controller framework. The results show that the constructed CRPF can accurately represent the collision risk distribution of the vehicles with different attributes and motion states. The proposed framework can effectively handle the maneuver of obstacle avoidance, lane change, and emergency response. The controller framework also presents good performance to avoid crashes under different levels of collision risk strength.",0,0,1

"Design and Analysis of a MEMS Comb Vibratory Gyroscope
MEMS (Micro-electro-mechanical Systems) refer to devices or systems integrated with electrical and mechanical components in the scale of microns. Due to its small size, low cost, low power consumption and high efficiency, MEMS technology has been widely used in many fields. In this paper, a novel comb-driven, differential capacitance sensing MEMS vibratory gyroscope based on glass-silicon-glass structure is proposed. The gyroscope is activated to vibrate along X axis by electrostatic comb driving. If an angular velocity along Y axis is experienced, the Coriolis force along Z axis activates the sensing vibration of the central mass along Y axis. The size of the driving beams and sensing beams are carefully chosen to reduce the frequency mismatch in two directions, thus increasing the gyroscope sensitivity. The working principle and dynamic analysis of this gyroscope are given and a set of optimized design parameters are derived based on the analysis. ANSYS FEM simulation is used to find out the device frequency and verify the theoretical prediction. The fabrication process flow of the MEMS gyroscope is also proposed. The microgyroscope can be used for inertial navigation in many applications, such as automobile, aerospaceship, microsatellite, consumer products, etc.",0,1,1
"Robust Model Predictive Path Integral Control: Analysis and Performance Guarantees
In this letter we propose a novel decision making architecture for Robust Model-Predictive Path Integral Control (RMPPI) and investigate its performance guarantees and applicability to off-road navigation. Key building blocks of the proposed architecture are an augmented state space representation of the system consisting of nominal and actual dynamics, a placeholder for different types of tracking controllers, a safety logic for nominal state propagation, and an importance sampling scheme that takes into account the capabilities of the underlying tracking control. Using these ingredients, we derive a bound on the free energy growth of the dynamical system which is a function of task constraint satisfaction level, the performance of the underlying tracking controller, and the sampling error of the stochastic optimization used within RMPPI. To validate the bound on free energy growth, we perform experiments in simulation using two types of tracking controllers, namely the iterative Linear Quadratic Gaussian and Contraction-Metric based control. We further demonstrate the applicability of RMPPI in real hardware using the GT AutoRally vehicle. Our experiments demonstrate that RMPPI outperforms MPPI and Tube-MPPI by alleviating issues of the aforementioned model predictive controllers related to either lack of robustness or excessive conservatism. RMPPI provides the best of the two worlds in terms of agility and robustness to disturbances.",0,1,1

"Novel Method for Multi-Dimensional Mapping of Higher Order Modulations for BICM-ID Over Rayleigh Fading Channels
Multi-dimensional (MD) mapping offers more flexibility in mapping design for bit-interleaved coded modulation with iterative decoding (BICM-ID) and potentially improves the bandwidth efficiency. However, for higher order signal constellations, finding suitable MD mappings is a very complicated task due to the large number of possible mappings. In this paper, a novel mapping method is introduced to construct efficient MD mappings to improve the error performance of BICM-ID over Rayleigh fading channels. We propose to break the MD mapping design problem into four distinct 2-D mapping functions. The 2-D mappings are designed such that the resulting MD mapping improves the BICM-ID error performance at low signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs). We also develop cost functions that can be optimized to improve the error performance at high SNRs. The proposed mapping method is very simple compared to well-known mapping methods, and it can achieve suitable MD mappings for different modulations including higher order modulations for BICM-ID. The simulation results show that our mappings significantly outperform the previously known mappings at a target bit error rate (BER) of 10−6. Our mappings also offer a lower error-floor compared to their well-known counterparts.",0,1,0
"Forecasting the Spread of Covid-19 Under Control Scenarios Using LSTM and Dynamic Behavioral Models
To accurately predict the regional spread of Covid-19 infection, this study proposes a novel hybrid model which combines a Long short-term memory (LSTM) artificial recurrent neural network with dynamic behavioral models. Several factors and control strategies affect the virus spread, and the uncertainty arisen from confounding variables underlying the spread of the Covid-19 infection is substantial. The proposed model considers the effect of multiple factors to enhance the accuracy in predicting the number of cases and deaths across the top ten most-affected countries and Australia. The results show that the proposed model closely replicates test data. It not only provides accurate predictions but also estimates the daily behavior of the system under uncertainty. The hybrid model outperforms the LSTM model accounting for limited available data. The parameters of the hybrid models were optimized using a genetic algorithm for each country to improve the prediction power while considering regional properties. Since the proposed model can accurately predict Covid-19 spread under consideration of containment policies, is capable of being used for policy assessment, planning and decision-making.",1,1,0

This category - design thinking should become one of the main areas of business development, startups and creating a comfortable environment not only in business but also in the organization of public programs and decisions, the organization of municipal economy, as well as management at the state level. Any startup begins with the formation of the idea. It should not be just an idea, but the idea that can change the world, change people's lives for the better. A mandatory condition for the development of the country's economic system is the development of the entrepreneurship. During the political reorientation of our country, changes in the economy are taking place primarily through the introduction of new ideas. Based on the existing issues of business organization, entrepreneurship development and especially the creation of startup projects in Ukraine, requires clarification of the peculiarities of the development of startups based on a new approach - design thinking. Requires research and further clarification of the application of design thinking in the work of enterprises, the use of innovative approaches to the organization of both new forms of business and the improvement of existing relationships and business processes. The purpose of the article is to study the conditions and features of the formation of the idea for the development of a modern product, modern technology or a new vector of business development on the platform of design thinking. Of course, these changes require the promotion of more competitive products created using innovative approaches, there is the implementation of a startup. Many methods can be used to understand the real problem and its causes. It is worth to analyze the problem. The analysis of the problem better provides understanding of the problem before starting work with it. Even at the stage of the problem formulation, may arise a lot of questions connecting with people perception, misunderstanding, and vision of its solutions. A fundamentally new approach of solving the problem is the design thinking. The design thinking is a method of creating products and services that are focused on the person. It is the process when researchers try to understand the consumer problems, to make assumptions and to check them, to change the problem statement and try to find alternative strategies and solutions. The design thinking basis is the empathy and the ability to form schematic images in the imagination to further identify patterns and generate ideas with emotional and functional content. Empathy is a broad concept that refers to a person's cognitive and emotional reactions to another's experience. The empathy benefits to build and rebuild relationships. On the other hand, through support we acquire the skills of better regulation of personal emotions, especially using such useful and valuable experiense in stressful circumstances. This determines another property of empathy - it promotes the development of healthier and more meaningful behavior. Implementing business ideas creates additional opportunities for businesses. This process begins with a specific problem - a task for design thinking. This task must be accessible, understandable and feasible.

"Design and Control of a Midair Reconfigurable Quadcopter using Unactuated Hinges
—A novel quadcopter capable of changing shape mid- ﬂight is presented, allowing for operation in four conﬁgurations with the capability of sustained hover in three. This is accomplished without requiring actuators beyond the four motors typical of a quadcopter. Morphing is achieved through freely- rotating hinges that allow the vehicle arms to fold downwards by either reducing or reversing thrust forces. Constraints placed on the control inputs of the vehicle prevent the arms from folding or unfolding unexpectedly. This allows for the use of existing quadcopter controllers and trajectory generation algorithms with only minimal added complexity. For our experimental vehicle at hover, we ﬁnd that these constraints result in a 36% reduction of the maximum yaw torque the vehicle can produce, but do not result in a reduction of the maximum thrust or roll and pitch torques. Experimental results show that, for a typical maneuver, the added limits have a negligible effect on trajectory tracking performance. Finally, the ability to change conﬁgurations is shown to enable the vehicle to traverse small passages, perch on hanging wires, and perform limited grasping tasks.",0,1,1
"A cross-space cascading failure hazard assessment method consideringbetweenness centrality and power loss
In order to accurately assess the hazard caused by cross-space cascading failure in the cyber-physical power system, we propose a quantitative assessment method. This method builds a comprehensive framework of assessment that takes into account the betweenness centrality of attack graph and the consequences of failure. The betweenness centrality of each node in the attack graph is used to characterize the frequency of failure. By calculating the number of all nodes on each attack path, the frequency of a certain fault is calculated. The power loss of physical node caused by each cross-space cascading failure is used to characterize the consequences of the fault, which is combined with the frequency of failure and the urgency of troubleshooting to calculate the hazard assessment value of the cross-space cascading failure. Finally, a variety of cross-space cascading failures are implemented in the simulation environment of local cyber-physical power system and their hazards are evaluated. The effectiveness of the proposed assessment method is verified.",0,1,1

"An Analysis of United States Online Political Advertising Transparency
During the summer of 2018, Facebook, Google, and Twitter created policies and implemented transparent archives that include U.S. political advertisements which ran on their platforms. Through our analysis of over 1.3 million ads with political content, we show how different types of political advertisers are disseminating U.S. political messages using Facebook, Google, and Twitter's advertising platforms. We find that in total, ads with political content included in these archives have generated between 8.67 billion - 33.8 billion impressions and that sponsors have spent over $300 million USD on advertising with U.S. political content. 
We are able to improve our understanding of political advertisers on these platforms. We have also discovered a significant amount of advertising by quasi for-profit media companies that appeared to exist for the sole purpose of creating deceptive online communities focused on spreading political messaging and not for directly generating profits. Advertising by such groups is a relatively recent phenomenon, and appears to be thriving on online platforms due to the lower regulatory requirements compared to traditional advertising platforms. 
We have found through our attempts to collect and analyze this data that there are many limitations and weaknesses that enable intentional or accidental deception and bypassing of the current implementations of these transparency archives. We provide several suggestions for how these archives could be made more robust and useful. Overall, these efforts by Facebook, Google, and Twitter have improved political advertising transparency of honest and, in some cases, possibly dishonest advertisers on their platforms.

The PQ disturbances are created by using parametric equations as well as electrical power distribution system models in MATLAB/SIMULINK environment. The PQ disturbances of voltage magnitude variation such as sag, swell and interruption are created by applying different types of faults and heavy load in the power distribution model. The frequency variation types of PQ disturbances like harmonics are generated by applying power electronic converter. The non-stationary or transient PQ disturbances are produced by applying a capacitor switching bank in distribution model. The results of PQ disturbance waveforms obtained by both techniques are very similar to realtime PQ signals. The PQ waveforms obtained are suitable for checking the performance of the new automatic classification algorithms.",0,1,1

"The Digital Twin Paradigm for Future NASA and U.S. Air Force Vehicles
Future generations of NASA and U.S. Air Force vehicles will require lighter mass while being subjected to higher loads and more extreme service conditions over longer time periods than the present generation. Current approaches for certification, fleet management and sustainment are largely based on statistical distributions of material properties, heuristic design philosophies, physical testing and assumed similitude between testing and operational conditions and will likely be unable to address these extreme requirements. To address the shortcomings of conventional approaches, a fundamental paradigm shift is needed. This paradigm shift, the Digital Twin, integrates ultra-high fidelity simulation with the vehicle s on-board integrated vehicle health management system, maintenance history and all available historical and fleet data to mirror the life of its flying twin and enable unprecedented levels of safety and reliability.",0,0,1

"Evaluation of an Augmented Reality Instruction for a Complex Assembly Task
Abstract This study compares the use of a marker-based AR instruction with a paper instruction commonly used in manual assembly. Hypotheses were tested as to whether the instruction type affects assembly time, number of errors, usability, and employee strain. Instead of student participants and artificial assembly tasks (e. g. Lego assemblies), the study was conducted with 16 trainees in a real workplace for the assembly of emergency door release handles in rail vehicles. Five assembly runs were performed. Assembly times and assembly errors were determined from recorded videos. Usability (SUS) and strain (NASA-TLX) were recorded with questionnaires. After a slower assembly at the beginning, the AR group assembled significantly faster in the fifth run. The comparable number of errors, usability and strain make marker-based AR applications interesting for knowledge transfer in manual assembly, especially due to the easy entrance and low costs.",0,1,0
"A neural network based space vector PWM controller for a three-level voltage-fed inverter induction motor drive
A neural network based implementation of space vector modulation (SVM) of a three-level voltage-fed inverter has been proposed in this paper that fully covers the linear undermodulation region. The neural network has the advantage of very fast implementation of SVM algorithm, particularly when a dedicated ASIC chip is used instead of a digital signal processor. A three-level inverter has a large number of switching states compared to a two-level inverter and therefore the SVM algorithm to be implemented in a neural network is considerably more complex. In the proposed scheme, a three-layer feedforward neural network receives the command voltage and angle information at the input and generates symmetrical PWM waves for the three phases with the help of a single timer and simple logic circuits. The ANN based modulator distributes switching states such that neutral point voltage is balanced in open loop manner. The frequency and voltage can be varied from zero to full value in the whole undermodulation range. A DSP based modulator generates the data which are used to train the network by backpropagation algorithm in MATLAB/Neural Network Toolbox. The performance of an open loop volts/Hz speed controlled induction motor drive has been evaluated with the ANN based modulator and compared with that of conventional DSP based modulator, and shows excellent performance. The modulator can be easily applied to a vector-controlled drive, and its performance can be extended to overmodulation region.",0,1,1
"Evaluation and comparison of SEA torque controllers in a unified framework
Series elastic actuators (SEA) with their inherent compliance offer a safe torque source for robots that are interacting with various environments, including humans. These applications have high requirements for the SEA torque controllers, both in the torque response as well as interaction behavior with its the environment. To differentiate state of the art torque controllers, this work is introducing a unifying theoretical and experimental framework that compares controllers based on their torque transfer behavior, their apparent impedance behavior, and especially the passivity of the apparent impedance, i.e. their interaction stability, as well as their sensitivity to sensor noise. We compare classical SEA control approaches such as cascaded PID controllers and full state feedback controllers with advanced controllers using disturbance observers, acceleration feedback and adaptation rules. Simulations and experiments demonstrate the trade-off between stable interactions, high bandwidths and low noise levels. Based on these tradeoffs, an application specific controller can be designed and tuned, based on desired interaction with the respective environment.",0,0,1
"Radio Frequency Energy Harvesting Technologies: A Comprehensive Review on Designing, Methodologies, and Potential Applications
Radio frequency energy harvesting (RF-EH) is a potential technology via the generation of electromagnetic waves. This advanced technology offers the supply of wireless power that is applicable for battery-free devices, which makes it a prospective alternative energy source for future applications. In addition to the dynamic energy recharging of wireless devices and a wide range of environmentally friendly energy source options, the emergence of the RF-EH technology is advantageous in facilitating various applications that require quality of service. This review highlights the abundant source of RF-EH from the surroundings sources, including nearby mobile phones, Wi-Fi, wireless local area network, broadcast television signal or DTS, and FM/AM radio signals. In contrast, the energy is captured by a receiving antenna and rectified into a working direct current voltage. This review also summarizes the power of RF-EH technology, which would provide a guideline for developing RF-EH units. The energy harvesting circuits depend on cutting-edge electrical technology to achieve significant efficiency, given that they are built to perform with considerably small current and voltage. Hence, the review includes a thorough analysis and discussion of various RF designs and their pros and cons. Finally, the latest applications of RF-EH are presented.",0,1,1
"Rate-dependent adhesion of viscoelastic contacts, Part I: Contact area and contact line velocity within model randomly rough surfaces
Abstract In this work, we investigate dissipative effects involved during the detachment of a smooth spherical glass probe from a viscoelastic silicone substrate patterned with micro-asperities. As a baseline, the pull-off of a single asperity, millimeter-sized contact between a glass lens and a smooth poly(dimethylsiloxane) (PDMS) rubber is first investigated as a function of the imposed detachment velocity. From a measurement of the contact radius a ( t ) and normal load during unloading phase, the dependence of the strain energy release rate G on the velocity of the contact line v c = d a ∕ d t is determined under the assumption that viscoelastic dissipation is localized at the edge of the contact. These data are incorporated into Muller’s model (Muller, 1999) in order to predict the time-dependence of the contact size. Similar pull-off experiments are carried out with the same PDMS substrate patterned with spherical micro-asperities with a prescribed height distribution. From in situ optical measurements of the micro-contacts, scaling laws are identified for the contact radius a and the contact line velocity v c . On the basis of the observed similarity between macro and microscale contacts, a numerical solution is developed to predict the reduction of the contact radius during unloading.",0,0,1

Supply chain management is related to the coordination of materials, products and information flows among suppliers, manufacturers, distributors, retailers and customers involved in producing and delivering a final product or service. In this setting the centralization of inventory management and coordination of actions, to further reduce costs and improve customer service level, is a relevant issue. In this paper, we provide a review of the applications of cooperative game theory in the management of centralized inventory systems. Besides, we introduce and study a new model of centralized inventory: a multi-client distribution network.",0,1,0
"Assuring Interoperability between Conductive EV and EVSE Charging Systems
The development and deployment rate of electric vehicles (EV) and plug-in electric vehicles (PEV) substantially depends on the corresponding EV supply equipment (EVSE). The facts that vehicles are intrinsically mobile and hence require interoperability between manufacturers, countries and charging points, implies that the components of the charging systems should extensively be tested, in order to allow access of the companies to the global market. The two most common automotive charging communication standards are the pulsewidth modulation (PWM) based IEC 61851-1 [1] and the CAN based CHAdeMO [2]. The third and latest approach is a power line communication (PLC) using V2Gprotocol specified by the ISO 15118 [3]. The norm has been published in 2014 and will become the standard in Europe and North America for DCand AC-Charging within the next years, since all major OEMs have decided to apply it. In order to implement the new standard in a way, that supports all specified use cases (e.g. private or public charging, plug & charge or external identification/payment) and simultaneously assure operation between all EV/EVSE communication controllers of different origins, dedicated verification techniques and routines are required. This paper introduces the ISO 15118 norm and suggests independent and reproducible test methods that allow developers and quality managers to achieve a high degree of interoperability.",0,1,1
"Bi-anisotropic Metamaterials Effective Constitutive Parameters Extraction Using Oblique Incidence S-Parameters Method
The S-parameters method for bi-anisotropic metamaterials effective constitutive parameters extraction is extended to oblique incidence. The proposed method enables to extract all unknown parameters using S-parameters measured over a single metamaterial slab. The bi-anisotropic metamaterial is a pseudochiral omega medium and assumed to have diagonal permittivity and permeability tensors. The extraction process suggested involves both analytical extraction equations and numerical optimization. This method is utilized to show the limited validity of the assumption of absence of spatial dispersion on which the proposed approach is based. The extraction method is demonstrated over bulk and artificial media such as SRR metamaterial and the results are validated with satisfactory agreement published data in the literature.",0,0,1
"Effective Neighborhood Functions for the Flexible Job Shop Problem
The flexible job shop problem is an extension of the classical job shop scheduling problem which allows an operation to be performed by one machine out of a set of machines. The problem is to assign each operation to a machine (routing problem) and to order the operations on the machines (sequencing problem), such that the maximal completion time (makespan) of all operations is minimized. To solve the flexible job shop problem approximately, we use local search techniques and present two neighbourhood functions (Nopt1, Nopt2). Nopt2 is proved to be optimum connected. Nopt1 does not distinguish between routing or sequencing an operation. In both cases, a neighbour of a solution is obtained by moving an operation which affects the makespan. Our main contribution is a reduction of the set of possible neighbours to a subset for which can be proved that it always contains the neighbour with the lowest makespan. An efficient approach to compute such a subset of feasible neighbours is presented. A tabu search procedure is proposed and an extensive computational study is provided. We show that our procedure outperforms previous approaches. Copyright © 2000 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.",0,0,0

"Deep Neural Net with Attention for Multi-channel Multi-touch Attribution
Customers are usually exposed to online digital advertisement channels, such as email marketing, display advertising, paid search engine marketing, along their way to purchase or subscribe products( aka. conversion). The marketers track all the customer journey data and try to measure the effectiveness of each advertising channel. The inference about the influence of each channel plays an important role in budget allocation and inventory pricing decisions. Several simplistic rule-based strategies and data-driven algorithmic strategies have been widely used in marketing field, but they do not address the issues, such as channel interaction, time dependency, user characteristics. In this paper, we propose a novel attribution algorithm based on deep learning to assess the impact of each advertising channel. We present Deep Neural Net With Attention multi-touch attribution model (DNAMTA) model in a supervised learning fashion of predicting if a series of events leads to conversion, and it leads us to have a deep understanding of the dynamic interaction effects between media channels. DNAMTA also incorporates user-context information, such as user demographics and behavior, as control variables to reduce the estimation biases of media effects. We used computational experiment of large real world marketing dataset to demonstrate that our proposed model is superior to existing methods in both conversion prediction and media channel influence evaluation.",0,0,0
"Survey on set‐based design (SBD) quantitative methods
Product development efforts now more than ever are in need of methodologies that can address the challenges of increased system complexities, shortening time to market, increased demands in mass customization, market instabilities, geographical barriers, improved innovation, and adaptability to emerging technologies. To address these challenges most companies will need to make key decisions early in the product development life‐cycle. In this early phase there are high levels of information uncertainty and information ambiguity. Under these circumstances many companies will converge too early to a point design (Point Based Design—PBD) which will lead to increased cost and schedule delays due to reworking the design later in the product development life cycle. To overcome these challenges many researchers have proposed the Set‐Based Design (SBD) methodology. However, there has been limited guidance on how to define, reason, and narrow sets while improving the level of abstraction of the design. To address such concerns, a literature review was conducted. The contributions of this research include: (1) aggregated literature from over 100 sources on quantitative methods (QM) that has not been considered SBD but does support set‐based thinking, (2) consolidated body of knowledge on QM to help industrial practitioners implement SBD, (3) defined gaps and opportunities for future research, and (4) defined strengths and limitations of QM and techniques to define, reason and narrow sets.",0,1,0
"A distributed attenuator for K-band using standard SMD thin-film chip resistors
This paper presents a distributed attenuator with standard SMD chip components. For low frequencies simple Pi and T-networks with chip resistors offer a good flexibility to design low cost attenuators in a microwave circuit. Nevertheless, with increasing frequency the parasitics of the chip resistors as well as the short additional line sections in the Pi and T network cause the design to fail. Here, a model of an 0201 chip resistor has been setup to show the limited operating range of the Pi and T-networks. Using a distributed attenuator design, two resistors separated by a quarter wavelength transmission line, can overcome these problems and extent the frequency range to K-band.",0,0,0
"A global optimisation method for robust affine registration of brain images
Registration is an important component of medical image analysis and for analysing large amounts of data it is desirable to have fully automatic registration methods. Many different automatic registration methods have been proposed to date, and almost all share a common mathematical framework - one of optimising a cost function. To date little attention has been focused on the optimisation method itself, even though the success of most registration methods hinges on the quality of this optimisation. This paper examines the assumptions underlying the problem of registration for brain images using inter-modal voxel similarity measures. It is demonstrated that the use of local optimisation methods together with the standard multi-resolution approach is not sufficient to reliably find the global minimum. To address this problem, a global optimisation method is proposed that is specifically tailored to this form of registration. A full discussion of all the necessary implementation details is included as this is an important part of any practical method. Furthermore, results are presented for inter-modal, inter-subject registration experiments that show that the proposed method is more reliable at finding the global minimum than several of the currently available registration packages in common usage.",0,0,0
"Digital Twin Concepts in Manufacturing Industries - A Literature Review and Avenues for Further Research
Within the profound digitalization in manufacturing industries, the concept of a virtual, digital equivalent to a physical product has gained increasingly attention. Labeled as digital twin, product avatar, or cyber-physical equivalence, various manifestations in different contexts can be detected in existing literature. Although both practitioners and researchers predict those digital twin concepts a bright future, it is not clear what the current state of research is. Hence, guided by an established literature review methodology and grounded on an in-depth analysis of 38 articles published in the time period from 2001 to 2016, this paper (1) provides an overview on established concepts, (2) classifies the existing body of literature, (3) provides a lifecycle perspective on applications, and (4) suggests directions for further research. With the limitation of the representative and interpretive character, our review contributes by enhancing transparency and understanding of digital twin concepts and supplying ideas and directions for future work.",0,0,0
"The Effects of Human Aspects on the Requirements Engineering Process: A Systematic Literature Review
Requirements Engineering (RE) requires the collaboration of various roles in SE, such as requirements engineers, stakeholders and other developers, and it is thus a very highly human dependent process in software engineering (SE). Identifying how “human aspects” – such as personality, motivation, emotions, communication, gender, culture and geographic distribution – might impact on the RE process would assist us in better supporting successful RE. The main objective of this paper is to systematically review primary studies that have investigated the effects of various human aspects on the RE process. We wanted to identify if any critical human aspects have been found, and what might be the relationships between different human aspects impacting the RE process. A systematic literature review (SLR) was conducted and identified 474 initial primary research studies. These were eventually filtered down to 74 relevant, high-quality primary studies. No primary study to date was found to focus on identifying what are the most influential human aspects on the RE process. Among the studied human aspects, the effects of communication have been considered in many studies of RE. Other human aspects such as personality, motivation and gender have mainly been investigated to date in relation to more general SE studies that include RE as one phase. Findings show that studying more than one human aspect together is beneficial, as this reveals relationships between various human aspects and how they together impact the RE process. However, the majority of these studied combinations of human aspects are unique. From 56.8 percent of studies that identified the effects of human aspects on RE, 40.5 percent identified the positive impact, 30.9 percent negative, 26.2 percent identified both impacts whereas 2.3 percent mentioned that there was no impact. This implies that a variety of human aspects positively or negatively affects the RE process and a well-defined theoretical analysis on the effects of different human aspects on RE remains to be defined and practically evaluated. The findings of this SLR help researchers who are investigating the impact of various human aspects on the RE process by identifying well-studied research areas, and highlight new areas that should be focused on in future research.",0,0,0
"Multistatic UWB Radar-Based Passive Human Tracking Using COTS Devices
Due to its high delay resolution, the ultrawideband (UWB) technique has been widely adopted for fine-grained indoor localization. Instead of active positioning, UWB radar-based passive human tracking is explored using commercial off-the-shelf devices. To extract the time of flight (ToF) reflected by the moving person, the accumulated channel impulse responses (CIRs) and the corresponding variances are used to train the convolutional neural networks (CNNs) model. Particle filter algorithm is adopted to track the moving person based on the extracted ToFs of all pairs of links. Experimental results show that the proposed CIR- and variance-based CNN models achieve less than 30 cm root mean square errors. Especially, the variance-based CNN model is robust to the scenario changing and promising for practical applications.",1,0,1
"Interface Behavior of Concrete Infilled Steel Tube Subjected to Flexure
Interface behavior of concrete-infilled steel tube (CFT) was investigated based on the experimental observations and numerical analyses. Laboratory tests were performed for twelve CFTs that consisted of two different cases of diameters where each diameter case was composed of three different cases of shear span length. Thereby, diameter and shear span parameters were considered to prove the question of whether there exists interface slip between steel tube and infilled-concrete. Confining effect of steel tube to infilled concrete was also investigated by measuring lateral strain as well as longitudinal strain. Based on the study, it was concluded that confining effect of steel tube to infilled-concrete is not influential under flexural loading and therefore, the sectional analysis is an effective way to estimate the flexural strength of CFT.",0,1,1
"k-Cut: A Simple Approximately-Uniform Method for Sampling Ballots in Post-Election Audits
We present an approximate sampling framework and discuss how risk-limiting audits can compensate for these approximations, while maintaining their ""risk-limiting"" properties. Our framework is general and can compensate for counting mistakes made during audits. 
Moreover, we present and analyze a simple approximate sampling method,""$k$-cut"", for picking a ballot randomly from a stack, without counting. Our method involves doing $k$ ""cuts"", each involving moving a random portion of ballots from the top to the bottom of the stack, and then picking the ballot on top. Unlike conventional methods of picking a ballot at random, $k$-cut does not require identification numbers on the ballots or counting many ballots per draw. We analyze how close the distribution of chosen ballots is to the uniform distribution, and design different mitigation procedures. We show that $k=6$ cuts is enough for an risk-limiting election audit, based on empirical data, which would provide a significant increase in efficiency.",0,1,0
"An Exact Solution for the TSP with Drone Based on a Decomposition Approach
1. Motivation The Traveling Salesperson Problem with Drone (TSP–D), introduced by Murray and Chu (2015) and further studied in Agatz, Bouman, and Schmidt (2016), Bouman, Agatz, and Schmidt (2018), Yurek and Ozmutlu (2018) is a vehicle routing model in which a given set of customers must be visited once, either by a truck route starting and ending at a depot or by a drone direct dispatch from the truck en route. Immediately after the drone visits a customer, it must rendezvous with the truck at one of the remaining customer nodes to be visited in the truck’s route. If the truck reaches the meeting point earlier, then it gets delayed until the drone arrives. The objective of the TSP–D is to minimize the truck route total duration, which is defined as the sum of its travel and waiting times. In theory, the TSP–D is NP–Hard since it generalizes the TSP. In practice, it has also proven to be a difficult problem to solve since it combines route sequencing and time synchronization decisions. In the literature, exact methods for the TSP–D have been proposed by Bouman, Agatz, and Schmidt (2018), Roberti and Ruthmair (2019), Tang, van Hoeve, and Shaw (2019) and Yurek and Ozmutlu (2018). As we are aware, only Roberti and Ruthmair (2019) reports results solving instances having more than 18 nodes via Branch–and–Price. Also, available compact formulations for the TSP–D in the literature constraint the feasible set of solutions to heuristically solve this problem. For example, Van Dijck, Bouman, and Spliet (2018) limits the number of nodes a truck can visit without the drone, but, as empirically suggested by Bouman, Agatz, and Schmidt (2018), this restriction can increase route total duration up to 15%. Others, use enumeration approaches, such as constraint programming, dynamic programming or full enumeration. Some of these approaches have solved bigger problems, but at the cost of more complex solution implementations. We propose a compact MIP formulation for the TSP–D, which is decomposed in two stages and solved via a Benders–type decomposition algorithm. To our knowledge, no research effort has",0,1,0
"Grid-Constrained Distributed Optimization for Frequency Control With Low-Voltage Flexibility
Providing frequency control services with flexible assets connected to the low-voltage distribution grid, amongst which residential battery storage or electrical hot water boilers, can lead to congestion problems and voltage issues in the distribution grid. In order to mitigate these problems, a new regulation has been put in place in Belgium, imposing a specific constraint: in any circle with a radius of 100 m, there can be at maximum 10 connection points providing frequency control at any time. This paper presents an impact analysis and a coordination strategy of a flexibility service provider (FSP) that operates a pool of assets and is exposed to this new regulatory constraint. Results show that at 5% participation, only 90% of total control capacity can be used, with a large difference between neighbourhoods with different population densities. A distributed optimization framework to coordinate the assets arises naturally, in which the assets are able to keep their local cost functions private and only have to communicate with neighbouring assets that are geographically close, and with the FSP. Analysis of the proposed distributed optimization algorithm shows a clear trade-off between optimality gap, owing to the mixed-integer nature of the problem, and iterations to convergence.",0,1,1

"A Quasi-one-dimensional Analytic Model of Rotating Detonation Combustors
A quasi-one-dimensional analytic model is proposed for the internal fluid of rotating detonation combustors (RDCs).

"Phase-change Slippery Liquid-infused Porous Surfaces with Thermo-responsive Wetting and Shedding States.
Slippery liquid-infused porous surfaces (SLIPSs) prepared with phase invariant materials (e.g., Krytox GPL oil) have been increasingly researched as low adhesion engineered functional surfaces in the last decade. However, phase change materials (PCMs) have been scarcely adopted, although they are potential candidates due to their inherent lubricant characteristics as well as temperature-dependent phases empowering unique thermo-responsive switchable wettability. Here, paraffin wax (an organic PCM) has been applied on hydrophobized nanoporous copper substrate to realize the phase-change SLIPSs (PC-SLIPSs) fabricated via spin-coating followed by thermal annealing, which overcomes earlier limitations encountered on the PC-SLIPSs. Advantages of these PC-SLIPSs are: the prompting of a low adhesion Wenzel (LAW) state opposed to earlier completely-pinned Wenzel state in the solid phase, and the optimized slippery state without excess of PCM in the liquid phase. Further, in order to characterize the intimate interactions between liquid droplets and the different phases of the PC-SLIPSs, i.e., solid, mush, and liquid phases, the contact line dynamics have been comprehensively investigated, unveiling the water droplet adhesion and depinning phenomenon as the function of thermo-responsive wetting states. Lastly, the PC-SLIPSs have also been tested for water vapor condensation, demonstrating the feasibility of dropwise condensation and the shift of droplet size distribution in both the solid and liquid phases. The results suggest that such engineered surfaces have great potential to prompt and tune dropwise condensation via thermo-responsive switchable wettability for heat transfer and water harvesting applications.",0,1,1
"Latency-Aware Dynamic Resource Allocation Scheme for Multi-Tier 5G Network: A Network Slicing-Multitenancy Scenario
In 5G slice networks, the multi-tenant, multi-tier heterogeneous network will be critical in meeting the quality of service (QoS) requirement of the different slice use cases and in reduction of the capital expenditure (CAPEX) and operational expenditure (OPEX) of mobile network operators. Hence, 5G slice networks should be as flexible as possible to accommodate different network dynamics such as user location and distribution, different slice use case QoS requirements, cell load, intra-cluster interference, delay bound, packet loss probability, and service level agreement (SLA) of mobile virtual network operators (MVNO). Motivated by this condition, this paper addresses a latency-aware dynamic resource allocation problem for 5G slice networks in a multi-tenant, multi-tier heterogeneous environment, for efficient radio resource management. The latency-aware dynamic resource allocation problem is formulated as a maximum utility optimisation problem. The optimisation problem is transformed and the hierarchical decomposition technique is adopted to reduce the complexities in solving the optimisation problem. Furthermore, we propose a genetic algorithm (GA) intelligent latency-aware resource allocation scheme (GI-LARE). We compare GI-LARE with the static slicing (SS) resource allocation; the spatial branch and bound-based scheme; and, an optimal resource allocation algorithm (ORA) via Monte Carlo simulation. Our findings reveal that GI-LARE outperformed these other schemes.",0,1,0

"Oil-gas-water three-phase flow characterization and velocity measurement based on time-frequency decomposition
Abstract As a highly complex and random process, oil-gas-water three-phase flow is commonly encountered in petroleum production and transportation. Flow velocity of each individual phase is an important parameter for production estimation and flow assurance. To measure the phase velocity of three-phase flow, a one-side ultrasonic transducer working in continuous wave Doppler mode and a conductance sensor were combined to obtain the Doppler shift signal and the holdup signal. Firstly, the water holdup fluctuations were decomposed by the continuous wavelet transform to get the local wavelet energy (LWE) coefficients map on the time-frequency diagram to characterize the local flow structures of each typical flow regime. Since the ultrasound was reflected and scattered by both liquid droplets and gas bubbles, the Doppler shift signal contains fluctuations in different scales. The Doppler shift signal was then processed by the short-time Fourier transform to reveal the correlation between the time-varying velocity characteristics and the flow structure. Thirdly, the ensemble empirical mode decomposition was used to decompose the Doppler shift signal into different intrinsic mode functions (IMFs), and the first three IMFs were selected as the main IMFs. Finally, combined with the LWE coefficient map to jointly analyze the flow dynamic characteristics, the specific IMFs were found well-correlated with the flow information of the specific phases. The models for phase velocities extraction were then established. The extraction results were validated through dynamic experiments. The root mean square error of the liquid superficial velocity, the gas superficial and the overall superficial velocity are 0.06 m/s, 0.06 m/s and 0.07 m/s respectively.",0,0,1
"Control method of robot suit HAL working as operator's muscle using biological and dynamical information
For assisting human motion, assistive devices working as muscles would be useful. A robot suit HAL (hybrid assistive limb) has been developed as an assistive device for lower limbs. Human can appropriately produce muscle contraction torque and control joint viscoelasticity by muscle effort such as co-contraction. Thus, to implement functions equivalent to human muscles using HAL, it is necessary to control viscoelasticity of HAL as well as to produce torque in accordance with operator's intention. Therefore the purpose of this study is to propose a control method of HAL using biological and motion information. In this method, HAL produces torque corresponding to muscle contraction torque by referring to the myoelectricity that is biological information to control operator's muscles. In addition, the viscoelasticities of HAL are adjusted in proportion to operator's viscoelasticity that is estimated from motion information by using an on-line parameter identification method. To evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed method, the method was applied to a swinging motion of a lower leg. When this method was applied, HAL could work like operator's muscles in the swinging motion, and as a consequence, the muscle activities of the operator were reduced. As a result of this experiment, we confirmed the effectiveness of the proposed method.",0,0,1
"Estimation of Tendon Force Distribution in Prestressed Concrete Girders Using Smart Strand
The recently developed smart strand offers the possibility of measuring the prestress force of the tendon from jacking and all along its service life. In the present study, a method estimating the force distribution in all the tendons of a prestressed concrete (PSC) girder installed with one smart strand is proposed. The force distribution in the prestressed tendons is formulated by the friction and the anchorage slip, and is obtained through an optimization process with respect to the compatibility conditions and equilibrium of the forces in the section of the PSC girder. The validation of the proposed method through a numerical example and experiment shows that it can be used to estimate the force developed in the tendon.",0,1,1
"Ab Initio Simulation of Band-to-Band Tunneling FETs With Single- and Few-Layer 2-D Materials as Channels
Full-band atomistic quantum transport simulations based on first principles are employed to assess the potential of band-to-band tunneling FETs (TFETs) with a 2-D channel material as future electronic circuit components. We demonstrate that single-layer (SL) transition metal dichalcogenides are not well suited for TFET applications. There might, however, exist a great variety of 2-D semiconductors that have not even been exfoliated yet; this paper pinpoints some of the most promising candidates among them to realize highly efficient TFETs. SL SnTe, As, TiNBr, and Bi are all found to ideally deliver ON-currents larger than 100 <inline-formula> <tex-math notation=""LaTeX"">$\mu \text{A}/\mu \text{m}$ </tex-math></inline-formula> at 0.5-V supply voltage and 0.1 nA/<inline-formula> <tex-math notation=""LaTeX"">$\mu \text{m}$ </tex-math></inline-formula> OFF-current value. We show that going from single to multiple layers can boost the TFET performance as long as the gain from a narrowing bandgap exceeds the loss from the deteriorating gate control. Finally, a 2-D van der Waals heterojunction TFET is revealed to perform almost as well as the best SL homojunction, paving the way for research in optimal 2-D material combinations.",1,0,1

"Challenges in On-Chip Antenna Design and Integration With RF Receiver Front-End Circuitry in Nanoscale CMOS for 5G Communication Systems
This paper investigates design considerations and challenges of integrating on-chip antennas in nanoscale CMOS technology at millimeter-wave (mm-wave) to achieve a compact front-end receiver for 5G communication systems. Solutions to overcome these challenges are offered and realized in digital 28-nm CMOS. A monolithic on-chip antenna is designed and optimized in the presence of rigorous metal density rules and other back-end-of-the-line (BEoL) challenges of the nanoscale technology. The proposed antenna structure further exploits ground metallization on a PCB board acting as a reflector to increase its radiation efficiency and power gain by 37.3% and 9.8 dB, respectively, while decreasing the silicon area up to 30% compared to the previous works. The antenna is directly matched to a two-stage low noise amplifier (LNA) in a synergetic way as to give rise to an active integrated antenna (AIA) in order to avoid additional matching or interconnect losses. The LNA is followed by a double-balanced folded Gilbert cell mixer, which produces a lower intermediate frequency (IF) such that no probing is required for measurements. The measured total gain of the AIA is 14 dBi. Its total core area is 0.83 mm2 while the total chip area, including the pad frame, is  $1.55 \times 0.85$  mm2.",0,0,0

"Integrating Floor Plans into Hedonic Models for Rent Price Appraisal
Online real estate platforms have become significant marketplaces facilitating users’ search for an apartment or a house. Yet it remains challenging to accurately appraise a property’s value. Prior works have primarily studied real estate valuation based on hedonic price models that take structured data into account while accompanying unstructured data is typically ignored. In this study, we investigate to what extent an automated visual analysis of apartment floor plans on online real estate platforms can enhance hedonic rent price appraisal. We propose a tailored two-staged deep learning approach to learn price-relevant designs of floor plans from historical price data. Subsequently, we integrate the floor plan predictions into hedonic rent price models that account for both structural and locational characteristics of an apartment. Our empirical analysis based on a unique dataset of 9,174 real estate listings suggests that current hedonic models underutilize the available data. We find that (1) the visual design of floor plans has significant explanatory power regarding rent prices – even after controlling for structural and locational apartment characteristics, and (2) harnessing floor plans results in an up to 10.56 % lower out-of-sample prediction error. We further find that floor plans yield a particularly high gain in prediction performance for older and smaller apartments. Altogether, our empirical findings contribute to the existing research body by establishing the link between the visual design of floor plans and real estate prices. Moreover, our approach has important implications for online real estate platforms, which can use our findings to enhance user experience in their real estate listings.",0,1,0
"Cooperative Pursuit With Multi-Pursuer and One Faster Free-Moving Evader
This article addresses a multi-pursuer single-evader pursuit–evasion game where the free-moving evader moves faster than the pursuers. Most of the existing works impose constraints on the faster evader, such as limited moving area and moving direction. When the faster evader is allowed to move freely without any constraint, the main issues are how to form an encirclement to trap the evader into the capture domain, how to balance between forming an encirclement and approaching the faster evader, and what conditions make the capture possible. In this article, a distributed pursuit algorithm is proposed to enable pursuers to form an encirclement and approach the faster evader. An algorithm that balances between forming an encirclement and approaching the faster evader is proposed. Moreover, sufficient capture conditions are derived based on the initial spatial distribution and the speed ratios of the pursuers and the evader. Simulation and experimental results on ground robots validate the effectiveness and practicability of the proposed method.",0,0,1
"Dynamic Linepack Depletion Models for Natural Gas Pipeline Networks
Given the critical role played by natural gas in providing electricity, heat, and other essential services, better models are needed to understand the dynamics of natural gas networks during extreme events. This paper aims at establishing appropriate simulation models to capture the slow dynamics of linepack depletion for natural gas pipeline networks. Three alternative ordinary differential equation (ODE) simulation techniques are derived and discussed, the first being the conventional one used in the literature. We show that the system of equations associated with this model is degenerate when flux injections are controlled (i.e. specified) at all nodes. The other two present useful frameworks for analyzing how networks respond to system-wide mass flux imbalances. These techniques offer different alternatives for simulating system dynamics based on how sources and loads are chosen to be modeled, and they are all proven to be non-degenerate in a tree-structured network. These proposed techniques are all tested on the 20-node Belgium network. The simulation results show that the conventional model cannot effectively capture linepack depletion under long term system-wide mass flux imbalance, while the proposed models can characterize the network behavior until the linepack is completely depleted.",0,1,1
"CFA Bayer image sequence denoising and demosaicking chain

The correct removal previous or simultaneously with the demosaicking process is not usually considered in the literature. We present a novel imaging chain including a denoising of the Bayer CFA and a demosaicking method for image sequences.

"Online extrinsic multi-camera calibration using ground plane induced homographies
This paper presents an approach for online estimation of the extrinsic calibration parameters of a multi-camera rig. Given a coarse initial estimate of the parameters, the relative poses between cameras are refined through recursive filtering. The approach is purely vision based and relies on plane induced homographies between successive frames. Overlapping fields of view are not required. Instead, the ground plane serves as a natural reference object. In contrast to other approaches, motion, relative camera poses, and the ground plane are estimated simultaneously using a single iterated extended Kalman filter. This reduces not only the number of parameters but also the computational complexity. Furthermore, an arbitrary number of cameras can be incorporated. Several experiments on synthetic as well as real data were conducted using a setup of four synchronized wide angle fisheye cameras, mounted on a moving platform. Results were obtained, using both, a planar and a general motion model with full six degrees of freedom. Additionally, the effects of uncertain intrinsic parameters and nonplanar ground were evaluated experimentally.",0,1,1

"Models partition for 3D printing objects using skeleton
Purpose 
 
 
 
 
It is a challenge to print a model with the size that is larger than the working volume of a three-dimensional (3D) printer. The purpose of this paper is to present a feasible approach to divide a large model into small printing parts to fit the volume of a printer and then assemble these parts into the final model. 
 
 
 
 
Design/methodology/approach 
 
 
 
 
The proposed approach is based on the skeletonization and the minima rule. The skeleton of a printing model is first extracted using the mesh contraction and the principal component analysis. The 3D model is then partitioned preliminarily into many smaller parts using the space sweep method and the minima rule. The preliminary partition is finally optimized using the greedy algorithm. 
 
 
 
 
Findings 
 
 
 
 
The skeleton of a 3D model can effectively represent a simplified version of the geometry of the 3D model. Using a model’s skeleton to partition the model is an efficient way. As it is generally desirable to have segmentations at concave creases and seams, the cutting position should be located in the concave region. The proposed approach can partition large models effectively to well retain the integrity of meaningful parts. 
 
 
 
 
Originality/value 
 
 
 
 
The proposed approach is new in the rapid prototyping field using the model skeletonization and the minima rule. Based on the authors’ knowledge, there is no method that concerns the integrity of meaningful parts for partitioning. The proposed method can achieve satisfactory results by the integrity of meaningful parts and assemblability for most 3D models.",0,0,0
"Virtual Energy Storage Sharing and Capacity Allocation
Energy storage can play an important role in energy management of end users. To promote an efficient utilization of energy storage, we develop a novel business model to enable virtual storage sharing among a group of users. Specifically, a storage aggregator invests and operates the central physical storage unit, by virtualizing it into separable virtual capacities and selling to users. Each user purchases the virtual capacity, and utilize it to reduce the energy cost. We formulate the interaction between the aggregator and users as a two-stage optimization problem. In Stage 1, over the investment horizon, the aggregator determines the investment and pricing decisions. In Stage 2, in each operational horizon, each user decides the virtual capacity to purchase together with the operation of the virtual storage. We characterize a stepwise form of the optimal solution of Stage-2 problem and a piecewise linear structure of the optimal profit of Stage-1 problem, both with respect to the virtual capacity price. Based on the solution structure, we design an algorithm to attain the optimal solution of the two-stage problem. In our simulation results, the proposed storage virtualization model can reduce the physical energy storage investment of the aggregator by 54.3% and reduce the users’ total costs by 34.7%, compared to the case where users acquire their own physical storage.",0,1,0
"An Integrated Steady-State Operation Assessment of Electrical, Natural Gas, and District Heating Networks

The important reason of such a view is the increasing utilization of cogeneration plants which makes a strong coupling between these networks. Another reason is the increasing usage of district heating networks because they have a higher efficiency besides a lower carbon dioxide emission than localized boilers.

Based on the signal model of ear canals, a novel method for solving the inverse problem of estimating the unique solution of the ear canal area function and the eardrum reflection coefficient given the acoustic input impedance at the entrance of an ear canal is presented. Up-sampling techniques to improve the accuracy of the estimates are also presented. The performance of this method and factors affecting the accuracy of the estimates are investigated via simulations. It is found that the accuracy of the estimates is limited by the measurement bandwidth of the given ear canal input impedance. In the audio frequency range, the estimates obtained approximate well to the true ones. To obtain more accurate estimates, a wider measurement bandwidth of the ear canal input impedance is required.",0,0,1

"Appliance Level Short-term Load Forecasting via Recurrent Neural Network
Accurate load forecasting is critical for electricity market operations and other real-time decision-making tasks in power systems. This paper considers the short-term load forecasting (STLF) problem for residential customers within a community. Existing STLF work mainly focuses on forecasting the aggregated load for either a feeder system or a single customer, but few efforts have been made on forecasting the load at individual appliance level. In this work, we present an STLF algorithm for efficiently predicting the power consumption of individual electrical appliances. The proposed method builds upon a powerful recurrent neural network (RNN) architecture in deep learning, termed as long short-term memory (LSTM). As each appliance has uniquely repetitive consumption patterns, the patterns of prediction error will be tracked such that past prediction errors can be used for improving the final prediction performance. Numerical tests on real-world load datasets demonstrate the improvement of the proposed method over existing LSTM-based method and other benchmark approaches.",0,0,1
"Queue Imbalance as a One-Tick-Ahead Price Predictor in a Limit Order Book
We investigate whether the bid/ask queue imbalance in a limit order book (LOB) provides significant predictive power for the direction of the next mid-price movement. We consider this question both in the context of a simple binary classifier, which seeks to predict the direction of the next mid-price movement, and a probabilistic classifier, which seeks to predict the probability that the next mid-price movement will be upwards. To implement these classifiers, we fit logistic regressions between the queue imbalance and the direction of the subsequent mid-price movement for each of 10 liquid stocks on Nasdaq. In each case, we find a strongly statistically significant relationship between these variables. Compared to a simple null model, which assumes that the direction of mid-price changes is uncorrelated with the queue imbalance, we find that our logistic regression fits provide a considerable improvement in binary and probabilistic classification for large-tick stocks, and provide a moderate improvement in binary and probabilistic classification for small-tick stocks. We also perform local logistic regression fits on the same data, and find that this semi-parametric approach slightly outperform our logistic regression fits, at the expense of being more computationally intensive to implement.",0,1,0
"Reinforcement Learning Provides a Flexible Approach for Realistic Supply Chain Safety Stock Optimisation
Although safety stock optimisation has been studied for more than 60 years, most companies still use simplistic means to calculate necessary safety stock levels, partly due to the mismatch between existing analytical methods’ emphases on deriving provably optimal solutions and companies’ preferences to sacrifice optimal results in favour of more realistic problem settings. A newly emerging method from the field of Artificial Intelligence (AI), namely Reinforcement Learning (RL), offers promise in finding optimal solutions while accommodating more realistic problem features. Unlike analytical-based models, RL treats the problem as a black-box simulation environment mitigating against the problem of oversimplifying reality. As such, assumptions on stock keeping policy can be relaxed and a higher number of problem variables can be accommodated. While RL has been popular in other domains, its applications in safety stock optimisation remain scarce. In this paper we investigate three RL methods, namely, Q-Learning, Temporal Difference Advantage Actor-Critic and Multi-agent Temporal Difference Advantage Actor-Critic for optimising safety stock in a linear chain of independent agents. We find that RL can simultaneously optimise both safety stock level and order quantity parameters of an inventory policy, unlike classical safety stock optimisation models where only safety stock level is optimised while order quantity is predetermined based on simple rules. This allows RL to model more complex supply chain procurement behaviour. However, RL takes longer time to arrive at solutions, necessitating future research on identifying and improving trade-offs between the use of AI and mathematical models are needed.",0,0,0
"SMPL: Simulated Industrial Manufacturing and Process Control Learning Environments
Traditional biological and pharmaceutical manufacturing plants are controlled by human workers or pre-defined thresholds. Modernized factories have advanced process control algorithms such as model predictive control (MPC). However, there is little exploration of applying deep reinforcement learning to control manufacturing plants. One of the reasons is the lack of high fidelity simulations and standard APIs for benchmarking. To bridge this gap, we develop an easy-to-use library that includes five high-fidelity simulation environments: BeerFMTEnv, ReactorEnv, AtropineEnv, PenSimEnv and mAbEnv, which cover a wide range of manufacturing processes. We build these environments on published dynamics models. Furthermore, we benchmark online and offline, model-based and model-free reinforcement learning algorithms for comparisons of follow-up research. †",0,1,0

The synthesis of the excitations of the MIMO system is first reformulated as that of matching an ideal “hybrid” pattern fitting capacity or low-interference constraints along with the angular coordinates. Then, a noniterative processing scheme is derived for each MIMO beam where numerically efficient synthesis techniques are profitably combined.

"A REAL TIME NEURAL NETWORK BASED FINITE ELEMENT ANALYSIS OF SHELL STRUCTURE
In recent years, the finite element method has been widely used as a powerful tool in the analysis of engineering problems. In the simulation of deformable objects using the finite element method, a complex system of nodes which make a mesh grid is used. The FEM model includes material and structural properties, which altogether determine the model’s response to certain loading conditions. A reliable simulation is supposed to provide for an easier, faster and less expensive development of structures. The real-time simulation of shell-type deformable objects using the finite element method for a non-linear analysis is a challenging task because of the need for fast systems that do not demand high computational cost. In this paper, we present an efficient method based on neural networks for simulating the real-time behavior of a thin walled structure modeled by the finite element method in the commercial FE software.

"Art to Engineering: Curved Folding and Developable Surfaces in Mechanism and Deployable Structure Design
Art to Engineering: Curved Folding and Developable Surfaces in Mechanism and Deployable Structure Design Todd G Nelson Department of Mechanical Engineering, BYU Doctor of Philosophy This work investigates how curved-crease origami and the developable surfaces which compose it can be transitioned to engineering design. Methods for creating flexible, tailorableproperty surfaces that function as thick panels in place of paper are presented. Concepts from curved-crease origami and developable surfaces that can describe and extend engineering applications are discussed and demonstrated. These concepts are particularly beneficial to applications where curved surfaces are integral to the function, deployability is desired, and planar manufacturing could be beneficial. The first part of this work uses arrays of compliant elements to create flexible-tailorable property surfaces. The key feature to these arrays is the alignment of the most flexible bending axis of the individual elements to the ruling line arrangement of a developable surface. This alignment can enable bending of thick panels while maintaining lower stresses, a quality necessary for the transitioning of curved-crease origami into thick materials. The stiffness and stress of these arrays is modeled and physical prototypes are demonstrated. Additionally, shape factors are developed for these compliant arrays (CAs) to facilitate material selection for the panels and understand how the geometry of the array changes the effective properties of the panel. The second part of this work describes and demonstrates several concepts of curved-crease origami and developable surfaces that can benefit mechanism and structure design, particularly in the context of rolling-contact mechanisms. The design of a rolling-contact joint connected by flexible bands similar to a Jacob’s Ladder toy is extended through incorporating curved creases into the design. The resulting design is deployable from a compact state to a functional state and can be manufactured from a single plane and folded into shape. Mathematical formulations are presented to describe the classes of developable surfaces in terms of properties which are frequently important in mechanism design. These natural equations for a single class of developable surface are conducive to modeling the folding motion of rigid-ruling developables, developables whose ruling lines do change location in a surface during folding. These formulations are used to generalize the design of rolling-contact joints to a family of joints capable of single degree of freedom spatial motions, being manufactured from a plane, and exhibiting a tailorable force response. Finally practical design suggestions for the implementation of rolling-contact joints is given. These include methodology to create sunken flexures which serve to increase the normal force between rolling bodies to prevent slip.",0,0,1

Forecast combination, a widely recognized best practice in point forecasting literature, has never been formally adopted to combine probabilistic load forecasts. This paper proposes a constrained quantile regression averaging (CQRA) method to create an improved ensemble from several individual probabilistic forecasts. We formulate the CQRA parameter estimation problem as a linear program with the objective of minimizing the pinball loss and the constraints that the parameters are nonnegative and summing up to one. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method using two publicly available datasets, the ISO New England data and Irish smart meter data. Comparing with the best individual probabilistic forecast, the ensemble can reduce the pinball score by 4.39% on average. The proposed ensemble also demonstrates superior performance over nine other benchmark ensembles.",1,1,1

"Decentralized adaptive fault-tolerant control for large-scale systems with external disturbances and actuator faults
Abstract This paper investigates the decentralized adaptive fault-tolerant control problem for a class of uncertain large-scale interconnected systems with disturbances and actuator faults including stuck, outage and loss of effectiveness. It is assumed that the upper bounds of the disturbances and stuck faults are unknown. The considered disturbances and unknown interconnections contain matched and mismatched parts. A decentralized adaptive control scheme with backstepping method is developed. Then, according to the information from the adaptive mechanism, the effects of both the actuator faults and the matched parts of disturbances and interconnections can be eliminated completely. Furthermore, cyclic-small-gain technique is introduced to address the mismatched interconnections such that the resulting closed-loop system is asymptotically stable with disturbance attenuation level γ . Compared with the existing results, disturbance rejection property can be guaranteed for each subsystem. Finally, a simulation example of a large-scale power system is provided to show the effectiveness of the proposed approach.",0,1,1

"Conical Kresling origami and its applications to curvature and energy programming
Kresling origami has recently been widely used to design mechanical metamaterials, soft robots and smart devices, benefiting from its bistability and compression-twist coupling deformation. However, previous studies mostly focus on the traditional parallelogram Kresling patterns which can only be folded to cylindrical configurations. In this paper, we generalize the Kresling patterns by introducing free-form quadrilateral unit cells, leading to diverse conical folded configurations. The conical Kresling origami is modelled with a truss system, by which the stable states and energy landscapes are derived analytically. We find that the generalization preserves the bistable nature of parallelogram Kresling patterns, while enabling an enlarged design space of geometric parameters for structural and mechanical applications. To demonstrate this, we develop inverse design frameworks to employ conical Kresling origami to approximate arbitrary target surfaces of revolution and achieve prescribed energy landscapes. Various numerical examples obtained from our framework are presented, which agree well with the paper models and the finite-element simulations. We envision that the proposed conical Kresling pattern and inverse design framework can provide a new perspective for applications in deployable structures, shape-morphing devices, multi-modal robots and multistable metamaterials.",0,0,1
"Convolutional neural networks for fluid flow analysis: toward effective metamodeling and low dimensionalization
We focus on a convolutional neural network (CNN), which has recently been utilized for fluid flow analyses, from the perspective on the influence of various operations inside it by considering some canonical regression problems with fluid flow data. We consider two types of CNN-based fluid flow analyses: (1) CNN metamodeling and (2) CNN autoencoder. For the first type of CNN with additional scalar inputs, which is one of the common forms of CNN for fluid flow analysis, we investigate the influence of input placements in the CNN training pipeline. As an example, estimation of drag and lift coefficients of an inclined flat plate and two side-by-side cylinders in laminar flows is considered. For the example of flat plate wake, we use the chord Reynolds number Rec\documentclass[12pt]{minimal} \usepackage{amsmath} \usepackage{wasysym} \usepackage{amsfonts} \usepackage{amssymb} \usepackage{amsbsy} \usepackage{mathrsfs} \usepackage{upgreek} \setlength{\oddsidemargin}{-69pt} \begin{document}$$\hbox {Re}_\mathrm{c}$$\end{document} and the angle of attack α\documentclass[12pt]{minimal} \usepackage{amsmath} \usepackage{wasysym} \usepackage{amsfonts} \usepackage{amssymb} \usepackage{amsbsy} \usepackage{mathrsfs} \usepackage{upgreek} \setlength{\oddsidemargin}{-69pt} \begin{document}$$\alpha $$\end{document} as the additional scalar inputs to provide the information on the complexity of wake. For the wake interaction problem comprising flows over two side-by-side cylinders, the gap ratio and the diameter ratio are utilized as the additional inputs. We find that care should be taken for the placement of additional scalar inputs depending on the problem setting and the complexity of flows that users handle. We then discuss the influence of various parameters and operations on the CNN performance, with the utilization of autoencoder (AE). A two-dimensional decaying homogeneous isotropic turbulence is considered for the demonstration of AE. The results obtained through the AE highly rely on the decaying nature. Investigation on the influence of padding operation at a convolutional layer is also performed. The zero padding shows reasonable ability compared to other methods which account for the boundary conditions assumed in the numerical data. Moreover, the effect of the dimensional reduction/extension methods inside CNN is also examined. The CNN model is robust against the difference in dimension reduction operations, while it is sensitive to the dimensional extension methods. The findings of this paper will help us better design a CNN architecture for practical fluid flow analysis.",0,0,1

"Progress toward fusion energy breakeven and gain as measured against the Lawson criterion
The Lawson criterion is a key concept in the pursuit of fusion energy, relating the fuel density n, (energy) confinement time τ , and fuel temperature T to the energy gain Q of a fusion plasma. The purpose of this paper is to explain and review the Lawson criterion and to provide a compilation of achieved parameters for a broad range of historical and contemporary fusion experiments. Although this paper focuses on the Lawson criterion, it is only one of many equally important factors in assessing the progress and ultimate likelihood of any fusion concept becoming a commercially viable fusion energy system. Only experimentally measured or inferred values of n, τ , and T that have been published in the peer-reviewed literature are included in this paper. For extracting these parameters, we discuss methodologies that are necessarily specific to different fusion approaches (including magnetic, inertial, and magneto-inertial fusion). This paper is intended to serve as a reference for fusion researchers and a tutorial for all others interested in fusion energy.",0,0,1

"Indirect Shared Control of Highly Automated Vehicles for Cooperative Driving between Driver and Automation
It is widely acknowledged that drivers should remain in the control loop of automated vehicles before they completely meet real-world operational conditions. This paper introduces an `indirect shared control' scheme for steer-by-wire vehicles, which allows the vehicle control authority to be continuously shared between the driver and automation through unphysical cooperation. This paper first balances the control objectives of the driver and automation in a weighted summation, and then models the driver's adaptive control behavior using a predictive control approach. The driver adaptation modeling enables off-line evaluations of indirect shared control systems and thus facilitates the design of the assistant controller. Unlike any conventional driver model for manual driving, this model assumes that the driver can learn and incorporate the controller strategy into his internal model for more accurate path following. To satisfy the driving demands in different scenarios, a sliding-window detector is designed to continuously monitor the driver intention and automatically switch the authority weights between the driver and automation. The simulation results illustrate the advantages of considering the driver adaptation in path-following and obstacle-avoidance tasks, and show the effectiveness of indirect shared control for cooperative driving.",0,0,1
"Differential Flatness of Quadrotor Dynamics Subject to Rotor Drag for Accurate Tracking of High-Speed Trajectories
In this letter, we prove that the dynamical model of a quadrotor subject to linear rotor drag effects is differentially flat in its position and heading. We use this property to compute feedforward control terms directly from a reference trajectory to be tracked. The obtained feedforward terms are then used in a cascaded, nonlinear feedback control law that enables accurate agile flight with quadrotors. Compared to the state-of-the-art control methods, which treat the rotor drag as an unknown disturbance, our method reduces the trajectory tracking error significantly. Finally, we present a method based on a gradient-free optimization to identify the rotor drag coefficients, which are required to compute the feedforward control terms. The new theoretical results are thoroughly validated trough extensive comparative experiments.",0,1,1
"Low-Complexity Multicast Beamforming for Millimeter Wave Communications
To develop a low-complexity multicast beamforming method for millimeter wave communications, we first propose a channel gain estimation method in this article. We use the beam sweeping to find the best codeword and its two neighboring codewords to form a composite beam. We then estimate the channel gain based on the composite beam, which is computed off-line by minimizing the variance of beam gain within beam coverage. With the estimated channel gain, we propose a multicast beamforming design method under the max-min fair (MMF) criterion. To reduce the computational complexity, we divide the large antenna array into several small-size sub-arrays, where the size of each sub-array is determined by the estimated channel gain. In particular, we introduce a phase factor for each sub-array to explore additional degree of freedom for the considered problem. Simulation results show that the proposed multicast beamforming design method can substantially reduce the computational complexity with little performance sacrifice compared to the existing methods.",0,0,0
"Some Observations on Human Control of a Bicycle
The purpose of this study is to identify human control actions in normal bicycling. The task under study is the stabilization of the mostly unstable lateral motion of the bicycle-rider system. This is done by visual observation of the rider and measuring the vehicle motions. The observations show that very little upper-body lean occurs and that stabilization is done by steering control actions only. However, at very low forward speed a second control is introduced to the system: knee movement. Moreover, all control actions are performed at the pedaling frequency, whilst the amplitude of the steering motion increases rapidly with decreasing forward speed.Copyright © 2009 by ASME",0,1,1
"Liquid Water Transport in Porous Metal Foam Flow-Field Fuel Cells: A Two-Phase Numerical Modelling and Ex-Situ Experimental Study
Proton exchange membrane fuel cells (PEMFCs) using porous metallic foam flow-field plates have been demonstrated as an alternative to conventional rib and channel designs, showing high performance at high currents. However, the transport of liquid product water through metal foam flow-field plates in PEMFC conditions is not well understood, especially at the individual pore level. In this work, ex-situ experiments are conducted to visualise liquid water movement within a metal foam flow-field plate, considering hydrophobicity, foam pore size and air flow rate. A two-phase numerical model is then developed to further investigate the fundamental water transport behaviour in porous metal foam flow-field plates. Both the experimental and numerical work demonstrate that unlike conventional PEMFC channels, air flow rate does not have a strong influence on water removal due to the high surface tensions between the water and foam pore ligaments. A hydrophobic foam was seen to transport liquid water away from the initial injection point faster than a hydrophilic foam. In ex-situ tests, liquid water forms and maintains a random preferential pathway until the flow-field edge is reached. These results suggest that controlled foam hydrophobicity and pore size is the best way of managing water distribution in PEMFCs with porous flow-field plates.",0,1,1

"Model Predictive Control with Environment Adaptation for Legged Locomotion
Re-planning in legged locomotion is crucial to track the desired user velocity while adapting to the terrain and rejecting external disturbances. In this work, we propose and test in experiments a real-time Nonlinear Model Predictive Control (NMPC) tailored to a legged robot for achieving dynamic locomotion on a variety of terrains. We introduce a mobility-based criterion to define an NMPC cost that enhances the locomotion of quadruped robots while maximizing leg mobility and improves adaptation to the terrain features. Our NMPC is based on the real-time iteration scheme that allows us to re-plan online at 25 Hz with a prediction horizon of 2 seconds.We use the single rigid body dynamic model defined in the center of mass frame in order to increase the computational efficiency. In simulations, the NMPC is tested to traverse a set of pallets of different sizes, to walk into a V-shaped chimney, and to locomote over rough terrain. In real experiments, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our NMPC with the mobility feature that allowed IIT’s 87 kg quadruped robot HyQ to achieve an omni-directional walk on flat terrain, to traverse a static pallet, and to adapt to a repositioned pallet during a walk.",0,1,1
"Who/What Is My Teammate? Team Composition Considerations in Human–AI Teaming
There are many unknowns regarding the characteristics and dynamics of human–AI teams, including a lack of understanding of how certain human–human teaming concepts may or may not apply to human–AI teams and how this composition affects team performance. This article outlines an experimental research study that investigates essential aspects of human–AI teaming such as team performance, team situation awareness, and perceived team cognition in various mixed composition teams (human-only, human–human–AI, human–AI–AI, and AI-only) through a simulated emergency response management scenario. Results indicate dichotomous outcomes regarding perceived team cognition and performance metrics, as perceived team cognition was not predictive of performance. Performance metrics like team situational awareness and team score showed that teams composed of all human participants performed at a lower level than mixed human–AI teams, with the AI-only teams attaining the highest performance. Perceived team cognition was highest in human-only teams, with mixed composition teams reporting perceived team cognition 58% below the all-human teams. These results inform future mixed teams of the potential performance gains in utilizing mixed teams’ over human-only teams in certain applications, while also highlighting mixed teams’ adverse effects on perceived team cognition.",0,0,0

"Why are many businesses instilling a DevOps culture into their organization?
Context DevOps can be defined as a cultural movement to improve and accelerate the delivery of business value by making the collaboration between development and operations effective. Although this movement is relatively recent, there exist an intensive research around DevOps. However, the real reasons why companies move to DevOps and the results they expect to obtain have been paid little attention in real contexts.

"Kalman Filter Channel Estimation in 2 × 2 and 4 × 4 STBC MIMO-OFDM Systems
Channel estimation is a challenging problem for space time block coding (STBC) multiple-input and multiple-output orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (MIMO-OFDM) systems in dynamic environments. To handle this problem and improve the system performance, this paper proposes a Kalman filter (KF) based channel estimation method applied to $2\times2$ and $4\times4$ STBC MIMO-OFDM systems. The proposed method based on the dynamic tracking property of KF is well adopted for dynamic channel estimation. First, a new orthogonal space-time codeword is adopted, and the orthogonal pilot sequences are designed to suppress the interference among transmit antennas. Then, the prediction and update characteristics of KF are researched, and the state space model is established for STBC MIMO-OFDM system. Subsequently, the channel state information (CSI) is estimated iteratively according to the KF estimation equation. At last, to further improve the accuracy of KF channel estimation, the threshold is utilized to suppress the noise in the channel impulse response (CIR) estimated by KF method. Simulation results verify that the proposed KF channel estimation method with orthogonal pilots and STBC provides better bit error rate (BER) and normalized mean square error (NMSE) performance compared with other conventional channel estimation methods, and it can be effectively adapted to dynamic multipath propagation conditions with different low and high order modulations.",0,0,0
"Dry-whip phenomenon in on-board rotordynamics: Modeling and experimentation
Abstract This paper addresses rotor-stator contact issues, especially the dry-whip phenomenon, as caused by base excitations. So far, this particular instability in the case of direct rub between shaft and stator was only shown by experiments to occur in response to mass unbalance excitation during run-up or run-down and/or to external disturbance such as direct impact applied to the rotor. The present paper aims to demonstrate that it can also be triggered by external forces coming from the rigid base motion. To this end, both numerical and experimental approaches are employed. A rotor finite element model combining on-board motions with shaft-stator rub impact is first proposed. This model is validated with a rotor test-rig supported by hydrodynamic bearings and mounted on a multi-axial hydraulic shaker and subject to a harmonic base motion. The dry-whip is then shown experimentally by using a base shock excitation consisting of two transverse translations, which is later confirmed numerically. The influence of important parameters on the dynamic behavior of the system is also assessed, such as the hydrodynamic bearing nonlinearities, the amplitude and direction of the base translations and the dry friction coefficient.",0,0,1

The number of companies opting for remote working has been increasing over the years, and Agile methodologies, such as Scrum, were adapted to mitigate the challenges caused by the distributed teams. However, the COVID-19 pandemic imposed a fully working from home context, which has never existed before. This paper investigation a two-phased Multi-Method study.

"Impact of Electric Vehicles Botnets on the Power Grid
The increased penetration of Electric Vehicles (EVs) in the transportation sector has increased the requirement of Fast Charging Direct Current (FCDC) stations to meet customer's speedy charging requirements. However both charging stations and EVs connection to the communication infrastructure as well as the power grid makes it vulnerable to cyber attacks. In this paper the vulnerability of the EV charging process is initially studied. We then show how a botnet of compromised EVs and FCDC stations can be utilized to launch cyber attacks on the power grid resulting in an increase in the load at a specific time. The effect of such attacks on the distribution network in terms of line congestion and voltage limit violations is investigated. Moreover the effect of the botnet of the transmission network is also studied. Simulation results demonstrate the possibility of line failures and power outage and hence the system's vulnerability to cyber attacks is established.",0,0,1
"A numerical scheme for filter boundary conditions in topology optimization on regular and irregular meshes
In density-based topology optimization, design variables associated to the boundaries of the design domain require unique treatment to negate boundary effects arising from the filtering technique. An effective approach to deal with filtering boundary conditions is to extend the design domain beyond the borders using void densities. Although the approach is easy to implement, it introduces extra computational cost required to store the additional Finite Elements (FEs). This work proposes a numerical technique for the density filter that emulates an extension of the design domain, thus, it avoids boundary effects without demanding additional computational cost, besides it is very simple to implement on both regular and irregular meshes. The numerical scheme is demonstrated using the compliance minimization problem on two-dimensional design domains. In addition, this article presents a discussion regarding the use of a real extension of the design domain, where the Finite Element Analysis (FEA) and volume restriction are influenced. Through a quantitative study, it is shown that affecting FEA or volume restriction with an extension of the FE mesh promotes the disconnection of material from the boundaries of the design domain, which is interpreted as a numerical instability promoting convergence towards local optimums.

"Personal price aware multi-seller recommender system: Evidence from eBay
Abstract Many e-commerce sites use recommender systems, which suggest products that consumers may want to purchase in order to increase site revenue. Though recommender systems have achieved great success, they have not reached their full potential. Most current systems share a common weakness: they fail to take into account dynamic properties of the offering which could dramatically improve the effectiveness of a recommendation; these characteristics include the product price, promotion indication, and seller's reputation. Particularly, in a multi-seller platform (e.g., eBay, Amazon), where competing firms sell products differentiated mainly by the seller's reputation and product price, modeling consumer's sensitivity to these dynamic properties and incorporating it into a recommender system will optimize sellers’ revenue and market penetration. In this research, we introduce a novel approach for a personal price aware multi-seller recommender system (PMSRS) which implicitly models a consumer's willingness to pay (WTP) for a specific product, taking into account discount indication and seller reputation, and incorporating it within a context-aware recommendation model to improve its effectiveness. We use six months of transactional data from eBay.com to test the proposed approach and prove its validity and effectiveness. Our results show that the proposed approach provides a good estimation of the consumer's WTP, and that incorporating the consumer's WTP and seller's reputation into a recommender system significantly improves its prediction accuracy (F-score improvements of 84% compared to a matrix factorization recommendation model which doesn't take into account the seller's reputation or consumer's WTP).",0,0,0

"Performance Enhancement of IEEE 802.11AX in Ultra-Dense Wireless Networks
IEEE 802.11ax, which is one emerging WLAN standard, aims at providing highly efficient communication in ultra-dense wireless networks. However, due to a large number of stations (STAs) in dense deployment scenarios and diverse services to be supported, there are many technical challenges to be overcome. Firstly, the potential high packet collision rate significantly degrades the network efficiency of WLAN. In this thesis, we propose an adaptive station (STA) grouping scheme to overcome this challenge in IEEE 802.11ax using Uplink OFDMA Random Access (UORA). In order to achieve optimal utilization efficiency of resource units (RUs), we first analyze the relationship between group size and RU efficiency. Based on this result, an adaptive STA grouping algorithm is proposed to cope with the performance fluctuation of 802.11ax due to remainder stations after grouping. The analysis and simulation results demonstrate that our adaptive grouping algorithm dramatically improves the performance of both the overall system and each STA in the ultra-dense wireless network. Meanwhile, due to the limited RU efficiency of UORA, we adopt the proposed grouping scheme in the Buffer State Report (BSR) based two-stage mechanism (BTM) to enhance the Uplink (UL) Multi-user (MU) access in 802.11ax. Then we propose an adaptive BTM grouping scheme. The analysis results of average RU for each STA, average throughput of the whole system and each STA are derived. The numerical results show that the proposed adaptive grouping scheme provides 2.55, 413.02 and 3712.04 times gains in throughput compared with the UORA grouping, conventional BTM and conventional UORA, respectively. Furthermore, in order to provide better QoS experience in the ultra-dense network with diverse IoT services, we propose a Hybrid BTM Grouping algorithm to guarantee the QoS requirement from high priority STAs. The concept of “QoS Utility” is introduced to evaluate the satisfaction of transmission. The numerical results demonstrate that the proposed Hybrid BTM grouping scheme has better performance in BSR delivery rate as well as QoS utility than the conventional BTM grouping.",0,1,0
"Dynamic locomotion for passive-ankle biped robots and humanoids using whole-body locomotion control
Whole-body control (WBC) is a generic task-oriented control method for feedback control of loco-manipulation behaviors in humanoid robots. The combination of WBC and model-based walking controllers has been widely utilized in various humanoid robots. However, to date, the WBC method has not been employed for unsupported passive-ankle dynamic locomotion. As such, in this article, we devise a new WBC, dubbed the whole-body locomotion controller (WBLC), that can achieve experimental dynamic walking on unsupported passive-ankle biped robots. A key aspect of WBLC is the relaxation of contact constraints such that the control commands produce reduced jerk when switching foot contacts. To achieve robust dynamic locomotion, we conduct an in-depth analysis of uncertainty for our dynamic walking algorithm called the time-to-velocity-reversal (TVR) planner. The uncertainty study is fundamental as it allows us to improve the control algorithms and mechanical structure of our robot to fulfill the tolerated uncertainty. In addition, we conduct extensive experimentation for: (1) unsupported dynamic balancing (i.e., in-place stepping) with a six-degree-of-freedom biped, Mercury; (2) unsupported directional walking with Mercury; (3) walking over an irregular and slippery terrain with Mercury; and 4) in-place walking with our newly designed ten-DoF viscoelastic liquid-cooled biped, DRACO. Overall, the main contributions of this work are on: (a) achieving various modalities of unsupported dynamic locomotion of passive-ankle bipeds using a WBLC controller and a TVR planner; (b) conducting an uncertainty analysis to improve the mechanical structure and the controllers of Mercury; and (c) devising a whole-body control strategy that reduces movement jerk during walking.",0,0,1
"Proactive Risk Management in a Dynamic Society
The objectives of the present study are to better understand the mechanisms of major accidents in the present dynamic and technological society. From this understanding, guides to improved strategies for industrial risk management are sought. It is important to consider carefully the present changes in a modern society when planning for industrial risk management. We are facing a period of technological change, deregulation, fierce competition, and increasing public concern. In a dynamic environment, hazard sources, their control requirements, and sources of disturbances change frequently and risk management can no longer be based on responses to past accidents and incidents, but must be increasingly proactive. That is, risk management must apply an adaptive, closed loop feedback control strategy, based on a measurement or observation of the level of safety actually present and an explicitly formulated target safety level. Due to human flexibility and creative intellectual powers, a human organization presents a particular potential for such an adaptive control, given the right conditions – people are a very important safety resource, not only an error source. In this approach, risk management can only be discussed in depth when considering carefully the decision making involved in the normal operation of the hazardous processes posing potential for major accidents. A key problem in this context is the information flow among the decision-makers at all levels of society: How are objectives, values, and operational targets communicated? How are the boundaries of safe operation identified and communicated? How is operation monitored through routine operational reports and reports from incidents and accidents? What do guidelines look like when an improved, consistent “safety control” must be established from a proactive control point of view? The book discusses these issues on the basis of the present rapid evolution of new cognitive approaches to the study of decision making in action and dynamic, learning organizations, and the rapid change of modern information technology with its potential for design of effective decision support systems.",0,0,0

Our approach is based on a general variational formulation for systems with time-dependent nonlinear nonholonomic constraints and time-dependent Lagrangian. For discrete open systems, the time-dependent nonlinear constraint is associated with the rate of internal entropy production of the system. We show that this constraint on the solution curve systematically yields a constraint on the variations to be used in the action functional. The proposed variational formulation is intrinsic and provides the same structure for a wide class of discrete open systems. We illustrate our theory by presenting examples of open systems experiencing mechanical interactions, as well as internal diffusion, internal heat transfer, and their cross-effects. Our approach yields a systematic way to derive the complete evolution equations for the open systems, including the expression of the internal entropy production of the system, independently on its complexity. It might be especially useful for the study of the nonequilibrium thermodynamics of biophysical systems.",0,1,1
"Adaptive and Efficient Model Predictive Control for Booster Reentry
Model predictive control (MPC) is an optimal control strategy where control input calculation is based on minimizing the predicted tracking error over a finite horizon that moves with time. This strategy has an advantage over conventional state feedback and output feedback controllers because it predicts the response of the system, rather than simply reacting to it. Therefore, MPC can offer improved performance in the presence of input and output constraints. Many implementations of MPC on aerospace vehicles appear in literature [1]. Some of these include spacecraft and satellite attitude control [2-4], spacecraft rendezvous and docking [5], helicopters [6], and atmospheric re-entry [7, 8].",0,0,1
"Characterization and Modeling of Self-Heating in Nanometer Bulk-CMOS at Cryogenic Temperatures
This work presents a self-heating study of a 40-nm bulk-CMOS technology in the ambient temperature range from 300 K down to 4.2 K. A custom test chip was designed and fabricated for measuring both the temperature rise in the MOSFET channel and in the surrounding silicon substrate, using the gate resistance and silicon diodes as sensors, respectively. Since self-heating depends on factors such as device geometry and power density, the test structure characterized in this work was specifically designed to resemble actual devices used in cryogenic qubit control ICs. Severe self-heating was observed at deep-cryogenic ambient temperatures, resulting in a channel temperature rise exceeding 50 K and having an impact detectable at a distance of up to $\mathrm {30~ \mu \text {m} }$ from the device. By extracting the thermal resistance from measured data at different temperatures, it was shown that a simple model is able to accurately predict channel temperatures over the full ambient temperature range from deep-cryogenic to room temperature. The results and modeling presented in this work contribute towards the full self-heating-aware IC design-flow required for the reliable design and operation of cryo-CMOS circuits.",0,1,1
"ReverseORC: Reverse Engineering of Resizable User Interface Layouts with OR-Constraints
Reverse engineering (RE) of user interfaces (UIs) plays an important role in software evolution. However, the large diversity of UI technologies and the need for UIs to be resizable make this challenging. We propose ReverseORC, a novel RE approach able to discover diverse layout types and their dynamic resizing behaviours independently of their implementation, and to specify them by using OR constraints. Unlike previous RE approaches, ReverseORC infers flexible layout constraint specifications by sampling UIs at different sizes and analyzing the differences between them. It can create specifications that replicate even some non-standard layout managers with complex dynamic layout behaviours. We demonstrate that ReverseORC works across different platforms with very different layout approaches, e.g., for GUIs as well as for the Web. Furthermore, it can be used to detect and fix problems in legacy UIs, extend UIs with enhanced layout behaviours, and support the creation of flexible UI layouts.",0,1,0
"Topology optimization of thermal conductive support structures for laser additive manufacturing
Abstract This paper presents a topology optimization approach to design support structures with efficient thermal conductive capabilities for powder-bed based laser additive manufacturing (AM). A transient heat transfer model is proposed to simulate the temperature distribution of the point-by-point and layer-upon-layer AM process. The process model is seamlessly integrated into a density based structural topology optimization method with an adjoint based sensitivity analysis and a gradient based optimization. For a given prototype shape, the layout of the corresponding support structure is designed such that the thermal energy during the fabrication process can be efficiently transferred from the laser path to a prescribed heat sink. Besides, an overhang constraint is proposed and used together with an AM filter to avoid overhang features in both the optimized support structure and the prototype, ensuring the overall manufacturability. Numerical examples and discussions are given to demonstrate its applicability.",0,0,1
"Use of the discrete fourier transform in the measurement of frequencies and levels of tones
This paper considers the application of a digital computer and discrete Fourier transform (DFT) techniques to the measurement of signals known to comprise only single-frequency tones. We discuss the use of weighting functions to improve the effective selectivity of a measurement system that estimates the frequencies and levels of tones from the coefficients of their DFT. We present three classes of weighting functions which may be used to improve the inherent accuracy of such a system. The form of the weighting functions was chosen to minimize the amount of computer memory required, without using too much computer time. Several formulas are derived for estimating the frequency and level of a tone from its DFT coefficients. We chose the formulas to minimize computation time. Simulation results indicate that, through the use of a proper weighting function, a DFT measurement system that uses 512 samples taken at a sampling frequency of 7040 Hz can be designed so that the maximum error in the frequency estimates of two tones near 1000 Hz and separated by approximately 50 Hz is about 0.03 Hz. The corresponding maximum error in the level estimate is on the order of 0.03 dB.",0,1,1
"GLiDE: Generalizable Quadrupedal Locomotion in Diverse Environments with a Centroidal Model
Model-free reinforcement learning (RL) for legged locomotion commonly relies on a physics simulator that can accurately predict the behaviors of every degree of freedom of the robot. In contrast, approximate reduced-order models are often sufficient for many model-based control strategies. In this work we explore how RL can be effectively used with a centroidal model to generate robust control policies for quadrupedal locomotion. Advantages over RL with a full-order model include a simple reward structure, reduced computational costs, and robust sim-to-real transfer. We further show the potential of the method by demonstrating stepping-stone locomotion, twolegged in-place balance, balance beam locomotion, and sim-toreal transfer without further adaptations.

"Privacy and brain-computer interfaces: identifying potential privacy disruptions
Brain-Computer Interfaces (BCIs) interpret neural activity, applying it to the control of external devices. As BCIs approach market viability, ethical implications come under consideration. This paper identifies potential privacy disruptions. BCI literature is reviewed in order to identify a BCI typology likely to support a privacy analysis. The typology describes the active, reactive, passive and hybrid types of BCI and, where possible, includes examples that are further classified as existing, prospective or speculative. A review of privacy theory supports an analysis that juxtaposes privacy theory and BCI technologies. The analysis finds that while all four types of BCI have potential for disrupting privacy, disruptions are more likely to arise from the use of reactive, passive and hybrid BCIs. Limitations and directions for future research close the paper.",0,0,0

Objectives: Determine the role of the friend request in unfriending decisions. Find factors in unfriending decisions and find differences in the perception of online and offline behaviors that vary depending on the unfriending decision. Method: Survey research conducted online. 690 surveys about unfriending were analyzed using exploratory statistical techniques. Results: The research results show that the initiator of the friend request has more than their expected share of unfriends compared to those who receive the friend request. There are online and offline factors for unfriending decisions; the research identified six constructs to evaluate unfriending decisions. There are 4 components for online behaviors (unimportant/frequent posts, polarizing posts, inappropriate posts and everyday life posts) and 2 offline components (disliked behavior and changes in the relationship). Survey respondents who said they unfriend for online reasons were more likely to agree that the person posted too frequently about unimportant topics, polarizing topics, and inappropriate topics compared to those who unfriended for offline reasons.",0,0,0
"An Analytical Model for CBAP Allocations in IEEE 802.11ad
The IEEE 802.11ad standard extends WiFi operation to the millimeter wave frequencies, and introduces novel features concerning both the physical (PHY) and Medium Access Control (MAC) layers. The hybrid MAC layer provides for two different kinds of resource allocations: Contention Based Access Periods (CBAPs) and contention-free Service Periods (SPs). In this paper, we propose a Markov Chain model to represent CBAPs, taking into account operation interruptions due to scheduled SPs and the deafness and hidden node problems that directional communication exacerbates. We also propose a mathematical analysis to evaluate the interference among stations and derive analytical expressions to assess the impact of various system parameters on some key performance metrics such as throughput, delay, and packet drop rate. This information may be used to efficiently design a transmission scheduler that allocates contention-based and contention-free periods based on the application requirements.",0,1,0
"Using abnormal TTL values to detect malicious IP packets
In general, an IP packet passes through less than 30 routers before it reaches a destination host. According to our observations, some IP packets have an abnormal time-to-live (TTL) value that is decreased by more than 30 increments from the initial TTL. These packets are likely to be generated by special software. We assume that IP packets with strange TTL values are malicious. This study investigates this conjecture through several experiments, and the results show that malicious packets can be discriminated from legitimate ones by observing only TTL values.",0,0,0
"Bounding the difference between model predictive control and neural networks
There is a growing debate on whether the future of feedback control systems will be dominated by data-driven or model-driven approaches. Each of these two approaches has their own compli-mentary set of advantages and disadvantages, however, only limited attempts have, so far, been developed to bridge the gap between them. To address this issue, this paper introduces a method to bound the worst-case error between feedback control policies based upon model predictive control (MPC) and neural networks (NNs). This result is leveraged into an approach to automatically synthesize MPC policies minimising the worst-case error with respect to a NN. Numerical examples highlight the application of the bounds, with the goal of the paper being to encourage a more quantitative understanding of the relationship between data-driven and model-driven control.",0,0,0
"Team Psychological Needs and Radical versus Incremental Creativity of Work Teams
ABSTRACT This study distinguishes between radical and incremental creativity at the team level. In addition, group composition in terms of members’ psychological needs is identified as a distinct driver of radical and incremental team creativity. Statistical analysis based on multisource data of 65 work teams shows that (a) team-level need for achievement has a negative main effect on radical team creativity, which disappears in teams with optimistic leaders; (b) team-level need for affiliation has a negative main effect on incremental team creativity, which becomes positive when teams possess high social competence; and (c) team-level need for power is positively related to radical and incremental team creativity. Our analysis demonstrates the multifaceted nature of team creativity and the distinct implications of team-level psychological needs for team creativity.",0,1,0
"Autonomy in Physical Human-Robot Interaction: A Brief Survey
Sharing the control of a robotic system with an autonomous controller allows a human to reduce his/her cognitive and physical workload during the execution of a task. In recent years, the development of inference and learning techniques has widened the spectrum of applications of shared control (SC) approaches, leading to robotic systems that are capable of seamless adaptation of their autonomy level. In this perspective, shared autonomy (SA) can be defined as the design paradigm that enables this adapting behavior of the robotic system.

Architectures and methods developed for SC and SA are discussed throughout the letter, highlighting the key aspects of each methodology. A discussion about open issues concludes this letter.",0,0,0
"Column generation for the discrete Unit Commitment problem with min-stop ramping constraints
The discrete unit commitment problem with min-stop ramping constraints optimizes the daily production of thermal power plants (coal, gas, fuel units). For this problem, compact Integer Linear Programming (ILP) formulations have been designed to solve exactly small instances and heuristically real-size instances. This paper investigates whether Dantzig-Wolfe reformulation allows to improve the previous exact method and matheuristics. The extended ILP formulation is presented with the column generation algorithm to solve its linear relaxation. The experimental results show that the Dantzig-Wolfe reformulation does not improve the quality of the linear relaxation of the tightest compact ILP formulations. Computational experiments suggest also a conjecture which would explain such result: the compact ILP formulation of min-stop ramping constraints would be tight. Such results validate the quality of the exact methods and matheuristics based on compact ILP formulations previously designed.",0,1,0
"DevOps Team Structures: Characterization and Implications
Context: DevOps can be defined as a cultural movement to improve and accelerate the delivery of business value by making the collaboration between development and operations effective. Objective: This paper aims to help practitioners and researchers to better understand the organizational structure and characteristics of teams adopting DevOps. Method: We conducted an exploratory study by leveraging in-depth, semi-structured interviews with relevant stakeholders of 31 multinational software-intensive companies, together with industrial workshops and observations at organizations’ facilities that supported triangulation. We used Grounded Theory as qualitative research method to explore the structure and characteristics of teams, and statistical analysis to discover their implications in software delivery performance.

"ZSM-based Management and Orchestration of 3GPP Network Slicing: An Architectural Framework and Deployment Options
—Driven by closed-loop automation, the Zero-Touch Network and Services Management (ZSM) framework offers invigorating features for the end-to-end management and or- chestration of a sliced network. Although ZSM is considered a promising framework by 3GPP, there is a lack of concrete ZSM-based solutions for the 3GPP Network Slicing management. This article presents an architectural framework of a ZSM-based management system for 3GPP Network Slicing. The proposed framework employs recursive ZSM management domains to meet the speciﬁc management requirements of the standard 3GPP Network Slicing framework. Two deployment options are considered for the presented framework. The ﬁrst option features the integration of the standard services of the 3GPP Management System within ZSM. The other one considers ZSM as a complementary system for the standard 3GPP Management System. From these deployment options, some key questions are identiﬁed on ZSM’s interoperability with the existing 3GPP Net- work Slicing systems. Finally, for each option, the architectural and operational feasibility of the ZSM interoperation with 3GPP Network Slicing systems is shown through an example use case.",0,1,0
"Automatic Building Detection from High-Resolution Remote Sensing Images Based on Joint Optimization and Decision Fusion of Morphological Attribute Profiles
High-resolution remote sensing (HRRS) images, when used for building detection, play a key role in urban planning and other fields. Compared with the deep learning methods, the method based on morphological attribute profiles (MAPs) exhibits good performance in the absence of massive annotated samples. MAPs have been proven to have a strong ability for extracting detailed characterizations of buildings with multiple attributes and scales. So far, a great deal of attention has been paid to this application. Nevertheless, the constraints of rational selection of attribute scales and evidence conflicts between attributes should be overcome, so as to establish reliable unsupervised detection models. To this end, this research proposes a joint optimization and fusion building detection method for MAPs. In the pre-processing step, the set of candidate building objects are extracted by image segmentation and a set of discriminant rules. Second, the differential profiles of MAPs are screened by using a genetic algorithm and a cross-probability adaptive selection strategy is proposed; on this basis, an unsupervised decision fusion framework is established by constructing a novel statistics-space building index (SSBI). Finally, the automated detection of buildings is realized. We show that the proposed method is significantly better than the state-of-the-art methods on HRRS images with different groups of different regions and different sensors, and overall accuracy (OA) of our proposed method is more than 91.9%.",0,0,1
"Forecasting of Electricity Generation by Solar Panels Using Neural Networks with Incomplete Initial Data
An increase in the number of alternative energy sources, in particular solar power stations in the generation structure of the modern energy systems, makes it difficult to control such energy systems due to the inconsistency in the amount of electricity production that depends on external factors. It also leads to an increase in risks when concluding electricity supply agreements in a modern energy market. This problem may be solved by forecasting electricity by modern means, such as neural networks. In this context, due to the flexibility and nonlinearity of neural networks there is no need for source data that directly affects the generation value, and there is a possibility of using indirect data available to most alternative energy producers. This has resulted in the creation of the solution based on neural networks that allows forecasting energy production using solar panels with high accuracy on the basis of conventional meteorological data.",0,1,1
"Reinforcement learning for pursuit and evasion of microswimmers at low Reynolds number
ing away from specific mechanisms developed by aquatic organisms or deployed for robots, the problem of pursue-evasion in microswimmers guided by hydrodynamic cues poses substantial difficulties that are rooted in the physics of the ambient medium. At low Reynolds numbers, flow disturbances are generally weak and characterized by symmetries [12] that create ambiguities about the location of the signal source especially when it is distant from the receiver [2, 3, 8]. Moreover, hydrodynamics has dynamical effects, since the disturbances generated by one microswimmer alter the motion of the other. Which pursuit-evasion strategies can be devised in such dynamic, partially observable environments? How do they compare with strategies based on visual cues? Can hydrodynamics be exploited and how? In this Letter, we explore the use of Multi Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) [13] as a general model-free framework for discovering effective strategies for chasing and escaping at low Reynolds number.

"Real-time time-optimal continuous multi-axis trajectory planning using the trajectory index coordination method.
Real-time time-optimal trajectory planning exists in a wide range of applications such as computer numerical control (CNC) manufacturing, robotics and autonomous vehicles. Generally, the methods to generate time-optimal trajectory can be categorized as non-real-time methods and real-time methods. Non-real-time methods such as direct optimization method tend to generate time-optimal trajectory through nonlinear or linear programming while it is computationally prohibitive for high frequency real-time applications. Current real-time methods are computationally efficient but either deal with the sparse waypoint trajectories or sacrifice the time optimality a lot. This paper innovatively proposed a time-optimal switching trajectory index coordination (TOS-TIC) framework to solve the real-time time-optimal planning problem for continuous multi-axis trajectories. The proposed method is able to generate time-optimal trajectory for continuous geometric paths while considering the axial velocity and acceleration constraints. The time-optimality of the trajectory planned by TOS-TIC is nearly the same as the offline planned optimal results. Meanwhile, the proposed method is computationally efficient for even 5kHz real-time applications. The main idea of TOS-TIC is coordinating several one-axis time-optimal switching controls to generate a modified control that decreases the state deviation from the desired trajectory. Several comparative experiments are carried out on an industrial biaxial linear motor stage. And the experimental results consistently verify that the proposed TOS-TIC real-time planner generates faster trajectory compared with the real-time lookahead method. In addition, the trajectory running time and final tracking error of the proposed method are nearly the same as the offline direct optimization method.",0,0,1

"EXOSMOOTH: Test of Innovative EXOskeleton Control for SMOOTH Assistance, With and Without Ankle Actuation
This work presents a description of the EXOSMOOTH project, oriented to the benchmarking of lower limb exoskeletons performance. In the field of assisted walking by powered lower limb exoskeletons, the EXOSMOOTH project proposes an experiment that targets two scientific questions. The first question is related to the effectiveness of a novel control strategy for smooth assistance. Current assist strategies are based on controllers that switch the assistance level based on the gait segmentation provided by a finite state machine. The proposed strategy aims at managing phase transitions to provide a smoother assistance to the user, thus increasing the device transparency and comfort for the user. The second question is the role of the actuation at the ankle joint in assisted walking. Many novel exoskeletons devised for industrial applications do not feature an actuated ankle joint. In the EXOSMOOTH project, the ankle joint actuation will be one experimental factor to have a direct assessment of the role of an actuated joint in assisted walking. Preliminary results of 15 healthy subjects walking at different speeds while wearing a lower limb exoskeleton supported the rationale behind this question: having an actuated ankle joint could potentially reduce the torques applied by the user by a maximum value of 85 Nm. The two aforementioned questions will be investigated in a protocol that includes walking on a treadmill and on flat ground, with or without slope, and with a load applied on the back. In addition, the interaction forces measured at the exoskeleton harnesses will be used to assess the comfort of the user and the effectiveness of the control strategy to improve transparency.",0,1,1
"Corporate Entrepreneurship and the Pursuit of Competitive Advantage
This paper presents a theoretical exploration of the construct of corporate entrepreneurship. Of the various dimensions of firm-level entrepreneurial orientation identified in the literature, it is argued that innovation, broadly defined, is the single common theme underlying all forms of corporate entrepreneurship. However, the presence of innovation per se is insufficient to label a firm entrepreneurial. Rather, it is suggested that this label be reserved for firms that use innovation as a mechanism to redefine or rejuvenate themselves, their positions within markets and industries, or the competitive arenas in which they compete. A typology is presented of the forms in which corporate entrepreneurship is often manifested, and the robustness of this typology is assessed using criteria that have been proposed for evaluating classificational schemata. Theoretical linkages are then drawn demonstrating how each of the generic forms of corporate entrepreneurship may be a path to competitive advantage.",0,0,0

"Learning to simulate and design for structural engineering
The structural design process for buildings is time-consuming and laborious. To automate this process, structural engineers combine optimization methods with simulation tools to find an optimal design with minimal building mass subject to building regulations. However, structural engineers in practice often avoid optimization and compromise on a suboptimal design for the majority of buildings, due to the large size of the design space, the iterative nature of the optimization methods, and the slow simulation tools. In this work, we formulate the building structures as graphs and create an end-to-end pipeline that can learn to propose the optimal cross-sections of columns and beams by training together with a pre-trained differentiable structural simulator. The performance of the proposed structural designs is comparable to the ones optimized by genetic algorithm (GA), with all the constraints satisfied. The optimal structural design with the reduced the building mass can not only lower the material cost, but also decrease the carbon footprint.",0,0,1

"Nonstationary Markov Chain Framework for Optimizing Dedicated Check-In Service
The arrivals of passengers at airport check-in counters represent a random process with variable arrival rates over time. Since the arrivals generally tend to occur at higher rates close to the beginning and end of the scheduled check-in, it is worth determining when additional counter(s) should be opened or closed. This problem becomes more complicated for large airlines at busy airports where they manage the check-in process for multiple flights. A model is developed here for optimizing the number of check-in counters as well as their opening and closing times.

"Using social network analysis to complete literature reviews: a new systematic approach for independent researchers to detect and interpret prominent research programs within large collections of relevant literature
ABSTRACT Literature reviews are required at early stages of a traditional research progression. Many systematic approaches help researchers identify relevant literature. However, there is far less support for interpreting large collections of references. Understanding the evolution of knowledge within a discipline requires an awareness of the collaborative networks from which significant advances originate. Unfortunately, this relational awareness is only acquired after years of professional experience. Therefore, early-career researchers are at a fundamental disadvantage when conducting literature reviews. Social Network Analysis (SNA) can make the interpretation of large collections of literature more manageable. This paper provides a method for generating a co-authorship network from reference lists. The partition of the co-authorship network into communities provides a reviewer with direction to organise literature into meaningful groups.

"An Adaptive Periodic-Disturbance Observer for Periodic-Disturbance Suppression
Repetitive operations are widely conducted by automatic machines in industry. Periodic disturbances induced by the repetitive operations must be compensated to achieve precise functioning. In this paper, a periodic-disturbance observer (PDOB) based on the disturbance observer (DOB) structure is proposed. The PDOB compensates a periodic disturbance including the fundamental wave and harmonics by using a time-delay element. Furthermore, an adaptive PDOB is proposed for the compensation of frequency-varying periodic disturbances. An adaptive notch filter is used in the adaptive PDOB to estimate the fundamental frequency of the periodic disturbance. Simulations compare the proposed methods with a repetitive controller and the DOB. Practical performances are validated in experiments using a multiaxis manipulator. The proposal provides a new framework based on the DOB structure to design controllers using a time-delay element.",0,1,1

"An Efficient Model Order Reduction Scheme for Dynamic Contact in Linear Elasticity
The paper proposes an approach for the efficient model order reduction of dynamic contact problems in linear elasticity. Instead of the augmented Lagrangian method that is widely used for mechanical contact problems, we prefer here the Linear Complementarity Programming (LCP) method as basic methodology. It has the advantage of resulting in the much smaller dual problem that is associated with the governing variational principle and that turns out to be beneficial for the model order reduction. Since the shape of the contact zone depends strongly on the acting outer forces, the LCP for the Lagrange multipliers has to be solved in each time step. The model order reduction scheme, on the other hand, is applied to the large linear system for the displacements and computed in advance by means of an Arnoldi process. In terms of computational effort the reduction scheme is very appealing because the contact constraints are fully satisfied while the reduction acts only on the displacements. As an extension of our approach, we furthermore take up the idea of the Craig-Bampton method in order to distinguish between interior nodes and the nodes in the contact zone. A careful performance analysis closes the paper.",1,1,1

"A Novel DSM Filtering Algorithm for Landslide Monitoring Based on Multiconstraints
With the aim of addressing the problems of vegetation interference and noise points existing in the process of digital surface model (DSM) filtering for landslide monitoring, this paper presents a point cloud filtering algorithm based on multiconstraints, which include vegetation detection, a multiview constraint, and local terrain continuity. The proposed algorithm is implemented via the following steps. First, we carry out the vegetation detection procedure and then remove the corresponding vegetation regions from the original images. Next, we utilize the multiview and local terrain continuity constraints to eliminate noise points from the generated point clouds (obtained through close-range photogrammetric processing). Finally, we apply the filtered point clouds to the landslide monitoring test to acquire reliable deformation information. The experimental results confirm that the vegetation and noise points can be effectively removed from the original point clouds by the use of the filtering algorithm proposed in this paper. Furthermore, accurate deformation areas can be obtained by comparing the DSMs from the different periods, and the achieved result is very close to the actual situation, which proves the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm.",0,1,1
"Non-intrusive PODI-ROM for patient-specific aortic blood flow in presence of a LVAD device
Left ventricular assist devices (LVADs) are used to provide haemodynamic support to patients with critical cardiac failure. Severe complications can occur because of the modifications of the blood flow in the aortic region. In this work, the effect of a continuous flow LVAD device on the aortic flow is investigated by means of a non-intrusive reduced order model (ROM) built using the proper orthogonal decomposition with interpolation (PODI) method based on radial basis functions (RBF). The full order model (FOM) is represented by the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations discretized by using a Finite Volume (FV) technique, coupled with three-element Windkessel models to enforce outlet boundary conditions in a multi-scale approach. A patient-specific framework is proposed: a personalized geometry reconstructed from Computed Tomography (CT) images is used and the individualization of the coefficients of the three-element Windkessel models is based on experimental data provided by the Right Heart Catheterization (RHC) and Echocardiography (ECHO) tests. At FOM level, we also consider the pre-surgery configuration in order to further validate the predictive capabilities of the model in several contexts. The ROM has been tested by considering a parametric setting with respect to the LVAD flow, which is a crucial parameter of the problem. We consider a parameter range that covers typical clinical values. The accuracy of the ROM is assessed against results obtained with the FOM both for primal, velocity and pressure, and derived quantities, wall shear stress (WSS). Finally, we briefly discuss the efficiency of our ROM approach.",0,0,1

"Help or hindrance? The travel, energy and carbon impacts of highly automated vehicles
Experts predict that new automobiles will be capable of driving themselves under limited conditions within 5–10years, and under most conditions within 10–20years. Automation may affect road vehicle energy consumption and greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions in a host of ways, positive and negative, by causing changes in travel demand, vehicle design, vehicle operating profiles, and choices of fuels. In this paper, we identify specific mechanisms through which automation may affect travel and energy demand and resulting GHG emissions and bring them together using a coherent energy decomposition framework. We review the literature for estimates of the energy impacts of each mechanism and, where the literature is lacking, develop our own estimates using engineering and economic analysis. We consider how widely applicable each mechanism is, and quantify the potential impact of each mechanism on a common basis: the percentage change it is expected to cause in total GHG emissions from light-duty or heavy-duty vehicles in the U.S. Our primary focus is travel related energy consumption and emissions, since potential lifecycle impacts are generally smaller in magnitude. We explore the net effects of automation on emissions through several illustrative scenarios, finding that automation might plausibly reduce road transport GHG emissions and energy use by nearly half – or nearly double them – depending on which effects come to dominate. We also find that many potential energy-reduction benefits may be realized through partial automation, while the major energy/emission downside risks appear more likely at full automation. We close by presenting some implications for policymakers and identifying priority areas for further research.",0,0,1
"Autonomous Fixed-Wing Aerobatics: From Theory to Flight
Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) are increasingly being proposed for a wide range of applications. A promising new class of these vehicles, known as agile fixed-wing UAV s, is intended to bridge the gap between conventional fixed-wing aircraft, which can cover long distances efficiently, and rotorcraft, which are typically very maneuverable. This paper addresses the implementation of a controller for agile UAVs, beginning with a hardware-in-the-loop (HIL) simulator, followed by testing on a real platform, both implemented on the Pixhawk microcontroller. We replace the Xplane physics engine used in the standard Pixhawk HIL with our own in-house Matlab/Simulink high-fidelity simulation of an agile UA V. The HIL simulator is found to provide substantial advantages in the transition from pure simulation to experimental testing. Once the controller is integrated into the flight platform, flight tests are conducted, and the results of those tests are compared to those from the HIL simulation and those obtained from the pure simulation environment, for maneuvers including hover, aggressive turnaround, knife-edge, and rolling Harrier. The desired position and orientation time histories were successfully tracked with the proposed implementation, demonstrating the impressive autonomous maneuverability that can be achieved by this type of aircraft.",0,0,1
"Flexible Energy Management Protocol for Cooperative EV-to-EV Charging
In this paper, we investigate the flexible power transfer among electric vehicles (EVs) from a cooperation perspective in an energy Internet based EV system. First, we introduce the concept of cooperative EV-to-EV (V2V) charging, which enables active cooperation via charging/discharging operations between EVs as energy consumers and EVs as energy providers. Then, based on the cooperative V2V charging concept, we propose a flexible energy management protocol, which can help the EVs achieve more flexible and smarter charging/discharging behaviors. In the proposed energy management protocol, we define the utilities of the EVs based on the cost and profit through cooperative V2V charging and employ the bipartite graph to model the charging/discharging cooperation between EVs as energy consumers and EVs as energy providers. Based on the constructed bipartite graph, we propose a max- weight V2V matching algorithm, which can lead to an optimized V2V matching in terms of the network social welfare. Simulation results verify the efficiency of our proposed cooperative V2V charging based energy management protocol in improving the EV utilities and the network social welfare as well as reducing the energy consumption of the EVs.",0,1,1
"Low-Complexity and Low-Overhead Receiver for OTFS via Large-Scale Antenna Array
Orthogonal time frequency space (OTFS) is a modulation technique that is dedicated to the high-speed mobility scenario. However, its transmission involves a two-dimensional convolution of the symbols of interest and the multipath fading channel, and it complicates the equalization. In addition to the high-complexity issue, the existing pilot pattern to estimate the unknown channel accurately requires large overhead to avoid the pilot being contaminated, which is spectrally inefficient. In this paper, we propose a receiver design by the marriage of the OTFS and a large-scale antenna array, which allows low-complexity detection and low-overhead pilot pattern design. The receiver is briefly summarized as follows. First, the received signal from each path of the multipath fading channel is identified by a high-resolution spatial matched filter beamformer facilitated by a large-scale antenna array. Then, the derivation shows that the received signal from an angle of arrival can be regarded as a flat-faded signal with rotations in both the delay and the Doppler coordinates. In addition, the identified signal from each beamforming branch in the delay-Doppler domain can be simply equalized using the channel information estimated by our pilot pattern. We further provide the estimator of the channel fading and the rotations of delay and Doppler in each identified branch. With these estimates, the delay and the Doppler shift in each identified branch can be compensated, and then, the signals from all angles of arrival are combined as different diversity versions. Furthermore, the equalization complexity is reduced to 5.0% of the message passing detection and our pilot pattern with only around 25% overhead of the existing pilot pattern ensures the same protection of the pilot. Moreover, the carrier frequency offset is considered and be compensated. The significance of the proposed receiver is its practicality, and it achieves better error performance with lower receiver complexity and lower overhead compared to the existing approaches, at the cost of a linear beamforming antenna array. The price is quite affordable, since the linear antenna array has moderate computational complexity, and it is deployed widely in current and future wireless communication systems. Eventually, the efficiency, the reliability, and the low complicacy of the proposed receiver approach are further validated by the numerical results.",0,0,0
"Deep reinforcement learning based conflict detection and resolution in air traffic control
The primary objective of this study is to incorporate the deep reinforcement learning (DRL) technique in conflict detection and resolution (CD&R) control strategies to generate an optimised trajectory for air traffic controllers as reference, in order to improve efficiency and reduce the amount of heading angle change. A DRL environment which can be applied to CD&R agent training is developed. The agent receives the current state of multiple aircrafts in a sector and generates an action to change the heading angle of an aircraft to avoid conflict. A K-Control Actor-Critic algorithm is proposed to limit the number of control times and a two-dimensional continuous action selection policy is utilised. The simulation results show the feasibility of DRL applied in CD&R and there is an obvious advantage in computational efficiency.",0,0,0
"Dynamic Subtitles: The User Experience
Subtitles (closed captions) on television are typically placed at the bottom-centre of the screen. However, placing subtitles in varying positions, according to the underlying video content (`dynamic subtitles'), has the potential to make the overall viewing experience less disjointed and more immersive. This paper describes the testing of such subtitles with hearing-impaired users, and a new analysis of previously collected eye-tracking data. The qualitative data demonstrates that dynamic subtitles can lead to an improved User Experience, although not for all types of subtitle user. The eye-tracking data was analysed to compare the gaze patterns of subtitle users with a baseline of those for people viewing without subtitles. It was found that gaze patterns of people watching dynamic subtitles were closer to the baseline than those of people watching with traditional subtitles. Finally, some of the factors that need to be considered when authoring dynamic subtitles are discussed.",0,0,0

"Identifying super-spreaders in information-epidemic coevolving dynamics on multiplex networks
Identifying super-spreaders in epidemics is important to suppress the spreading of disease especially when the medical resource is limited. In the modern society, the information on epidemics transmits swiftly through various communication channels which contributes much to the suppression of epidemics. Here we study on the identification of super-spreaders in the information-disease coupled spreading dynamics. Firstly, we find that the centralities in physical contact layer are no longer effective to identify super-spreaders in epidemics, which is due to the suppression effects from the information spreading. Then by considering the structural and dynamical couplings between the communication layer and physical contact layer, we propose a centrality measure called coupling-sensitive centrality to identify super-spreaders in disease spreading. Simulation results on synthesized and real-world multiplex networks show that the proposed measure is not only much more accurate than centralities on the single network, but also outperforms two typical multilayer centralities in identifying super-spreaders. These findings imply that considering the structural and dynamical couplings between layers is very necessary in identifying the key roles in the coupled multilayer systems.",0,0,0

"Numerical Simulation of Dynamic Impact Test for Optimized Automobile Wheel Rim
In automobile sector wheel rim is one of the important part which are used as protection for passengers from collision. There are number of wheel test are available in designing of ri to fulfill the safety requirements and standards. The aim of this study was to analyze and study the structure for car wheel rim by using the numerical method. The most of the test procedure has to comply with international standards, which establishes minimum mechanical requirements and impact collision characteristics of wheels. Numerical implementation of impact test is convenient for shorten the design time and lower development cost. In this study cast aluminium alloy wheel rim are used for simulation of impact test by using 3–D explicit finite element methods. The design of aluminium alloy wheel for automobile application which is carried out and paying special attention to optimization of the shape and mass of the wheel rim according to aesthetical point of view, to overcome the wheel cap. A finite element model of the wheel with its tire and striker were developed taking account of the nonlinearity material properties. Simulation was conducted to study the stress and displacement distributions during impact test. The analyses results are presented as a function of time. The study is carried under the above constraints and the results are taken to carryout for further analysis i.e. shape and weight optimization of the wheel.

The objective of this paper is to design an aluminium alloy rim through aesthetical view that overcomes the wheel cap by meeting all the design standards. In this paper, the volume of the rim is considered for optimization because the other parts of wheel assembly having numerical based design which cannot be change easily. Weight Optimization has been carried out and three pattern of optimized rim are analyzed under the radial and fatigue loading to determine the stresses induced in the static condition. The further modifications are done on the final model by applying colour to achieve the best graphical view similar to the wheel cap. II. THEORY OF WHEEL The rim is defined as the supporting member for the tire or tire and the tube assembly. The disc wheel is a permanent combination of the rim and the disc. The disc or the spider is defined as the centre member of a disc wheel. 2.1 Type of wheel rim Depending upon construction there are two types of vehicle rim one is single piece rim and another is multi piece rim. Also the wheel rims are classified on the position of the wheel disk Inset wheel, Zeroset wheel, Outset wheel[6]. 2.2 Rim Nomenclature 1. Rim The part of the wheel on which the tyre is mounted and supported. 2. Wheel Disc That part of the wheel which is the supporting member between the axle and the rim. 3. Single Wheel A wheel which supports one tyre on one end of an axle. 4. Offset This is a space between wheel mounting surface where it is bolted to hub and centre of the line. 5. Flange The flange is a part of rim which holds the both beds of the tire 6. Outset Wheel A wheel so constructed that the ccntre line of the rim is located outboard of the attachment. Fig. 2: Terminology of wheel rim[6] 2.3 Aesthetical Weight Optimization The basic concept of shape optimization design is to place material in areas that truly need it and thin out unnecessary material from areas that are not important for correct function in order to obtain the minimum shape that satisfies all the necessary functional requirements, such as mechanical strength and rigidity [7]. Fig. 3: Scope of mass optimization Fig. 3 shows the proposed area of rim from mass will be reduced. Spurred by the lightening needs mentioned above, recently the demand for the ability to determine optimal shapes easily has been mounting [8].

FINITE ELEMENT ANALYSIS Finite Element Analysis of the wheel tests can reduces the time and cost required to finalise the wheel design. Thus, the FEA simulation could be conducted, without making costly modification to tooling and equipment in real production. Therefore, in order to eliminate the physical test, the FEA simulation of the impact test should gives reliable information. It is important to consider the effect of the tire portion on the wheel during impact performance test. In this study, the finite element model of an aluminium alloy wheel with its tire and striker were generated with the large deformable, highly non–linear material properties. In the case of strike that changes its magnitude and direction within a very short time, explicit coded software that considers dynamic forces as well as static forces is employed. In the tire model, to obtain realistic response essential features must be included due to its highly anisotropic, visco elastic and composite structure. 3.1 Finite Element Model The meshing is prepared in the Hypermesh software, and elements are created. Tetrahedral 2nd order elements are used to mesh the alloy wheel. Striker and shell are made by the shell element having 10 mm thickness for tire model. There are 40951 tetrahedral shell elements and 17896 nodes are created. Fig. 5: 3D element representation of Wheel Rim 3.2 Impact Test Procedure International Journal of Engineering and Techniques Volume 2 Issue 5, Sep – Oct 2016 ISSN: 2395-1303 http://www.ijetjournal.org Page 83 Fig. 6: Impact loading test machine The FE analysis of wheel impact test obeys the experimental procedure, which was described in the ISO 7141-1981. The whole numerical model is an assembly consisting of three main parts, namely a wheel, fixture and striker shown in Figure 5. As the fixture is used to locate the wheel rim at 13° (± 1 degree) about horizontal and the base surface and bolt position having fix support. Therefore fixture doesn’t consider in actual numerical modeling. Striker and wheel rim having the point contact, so the nodes at the surface between the rim and striker are constrained to move together. The full model consists of 159757 elements. The mass of the striker is a variable and it is depend upon the maximum static load acts on the wheel. M = 0.6W + 180 ................(1) Where, M is the mass of the striker and W is the maximum static load acts on the wheel. According to ISO 7141, striker cross section area 125 mm in width, 375 mm in length and height is adjusted so that the mass of the striker is same as that of striker used in real experiment. Dropping height of the striker is 230 mm (± 2 mm) above the highest point of the rim flange and the striker is placed over the rim and its edge overlaps the rim flange by 25 mm. For the purpose of reducing required time, the initial dropping height of the striker (which represents the distance between the top most point on the rim flange and the lower surface of the striker) was changed from the initial value of 230 mm to 0, but with similar impact energy. The magnitude of the initial velocity of the striker was calculated using the following equation, V = .......................(2) Where, V is the initial velocity of the striker and g is the acceleration of the gravity (9.81 m/s2) and h = 0.23 m (dropping height)[8]. 3.3 Material properties Generally used wheel rim materials are Al alloy, Mg alloy, forged Steel. If original equipment manufacturers require excellent aesthetic shape with very good heat dissipation without compromise with its associated costs then light weight material such as Al and Mg alloys can be used for wheel rims. For this study Al-Si (B.S.: LM25 alloy) is used. The properties of the alloy are shown below.

Tire is made of layers of rubberized fabric, called plies, that gives the tire strength and flexibility. The main body of the tire is hyper elastic rubber that shows a nonlinear stress–strain relationship. Average tire material characteristic can be described by the Mooney–Rivlin material formulation, which is nearly identical to two constants parameter. Steel reinforcement is modelled by linear elastic material[9]. The striker used in the dynamic analysis was modelled as an elastic material using steel material properties. Young’s modulus is 200 GPa, Poisson’s ratio is 0.3 and density is 7850 kg/m3. IV.

"On the shape of air–liquid interfaces with surface tension that bound rigidly rotating liquids in partially filled containers
The interface shape of a fluid in rigid body rotation about its axis and partially filling the container is often the subject of a homework problem in the first graduate fluids class. In that problem, surface tension is neglected, the interface shape is parabolic and the contact angle boundary condition is not satisfied in general. When surface tension is accounted for, the shapes exhibit much richer dependencies as a function of rotation velocity. We analyze steady interface shapes in rotating right-circular cylindrical containers under rigid body rotation in zero gravity. We pay especial attention to shapes near criticality, in which the interface, or part thereof, becomes straight and parallel to the axis of rotation at certain specific rotational speeds. We examine geometries where the container is axially infinite and derive properties of their solutions. We then examine in detail two special cases of menisci in a cylindrical container: a meniscus spanning the cross section; and a meniscus forming a bubble. In each case we develop exact solutions for the respective axial lengths as infinite series in powers of appropriate rotation parameters; and we find the respective asymptotic behaviors as the shapes approach their critical configuration. Finally we apply the method of asymptotic approximants to yield analytical expressions for the axial lengths of menisci over the whole range of rotation speeds. In this application, the analytical solution is employed to examine errors introduced by the assumption that the interface is a right circular cylinder; this assumption is key to the spinning bubble method used to measure surface tension.",0,0,1
"Group heterogeneity and faultlines: Comparing alignment and dispersion theories of group composition
This field study examines group diversity from two theoretical viewpoints: dispersion approach (heterogeneity) and alignment approach (faultlines). We argue that the alignment approach provides an additional explanatory tool to that of the dispersion approach in understanding the effects of group composition on process and outcomes. Data from 60 work groups show that whereas groups with strong faultlines had higher levels of intragroup conflict and lower levels of performance and satisfaction, groups that were heterogeneous in tenure and functional background had higher levels of performance. Task conflict and process conflict mediated the relationship between faultlines and satisfaction.

"Affine Body Dynamics: Fast, Stable & Intersection-free Simulation of Stiff Materials
Fig. 1. Geared system.We propose an affine body dynamics framework (ABD) to efficiently and robustly simulate close-to-rigid contacting objects. ABD significantly eases the collision and contact processing costs over rigid body modeling while obtaining intersection-free trajectories leveraging barrier-based frictional contact model. Here, in a challenging stress-test benchmark we simulate a complex geared system composed of 28 toothed gears with frictional contact resolving all interactions. The combined gear set mesh is comprised of over 2, 450K surface triangles. A torque applied to the actuated gear (highlighted in red arrow) drives the motion of the entire system via contact, with well over a quarter of all surface elements in active contact in every time step. Here we find that all the existing rigid body simulation algorithms, including rigid-IPC, fail to make progress, while ABD robustly simulates the example to completion. ABD allows large time step sizes (e.g., with Δt = 1/50 sec) even for such complex displacement (rotation) contact processing. For a time step size of 1/100 sec, ABD simulates each step in less than 12 sec on an intel i9 CPU (multi-threaded), while the simulation runs at an interactive rate on a 3090 GPU (5-10 time steps per second).",0,0,1

Simulation data show effects of these factors on solder plastic strain, indicating solder crack improvement by higher-CTE EMC, thicker solder, thinner die, and continuous clip design. Based on recommendation by simulation, samples with selected EMC, J-bent clip and thicker die solder thickness were made for reliability testing, which already passed 4000 cycles TCT. Experimental data well matched simulation data. The paper demonstrated a good case of simulation driven development.",0,1,1
"Auto parking path planning system using modified Reeds-Shepp curve algorithm
In this research, Auto-parking path planning system for an autonomous vehicle is developed. Reeds-Shepp curve algorithm make shortest path with the vehicle minimum turning radius and straight line from start point to goal point. In Reeds-Shepp curve algorithm total 48 path formulas are existed but these formulas are limited in actual parking lot. Because Reeds-Shepp curve path are valid in open environment, Reeds-Shepp curve algorithm were modified in this research for effective forward and backward auto parking system. Advantage of the proposed auto parking system is that the vehicle control system have simple command data which let the vehicle move forward, backward, lateral direction and track a travel distance values. In this paper, the algorithm which generate the path in real time from any start point to any goal point is proposed.",0,0,0
"When Do We Need a Human? Anthropomorphic Design and Trustworthiness of Conversational Agents
Conversational agents interact with users via the most natural interface: human language. A prerequisite for their successful diffusion across use cases is user trust. Following extant research, it is reasonable to assume that increasing the human-likeness of conversational agents represents an effective trust-inducing design strategy. The present article challenges this assumption by considering an opposing theoretical perspective on the human-agent trust-relationship. Based on an extensive review of the two conflicting theoretical positions and related empirical findings, we posit that the agent substitution type (humanlike vs. computer-like) represents a situational determinant on the trust-inducing effect of anthropomorphic design. We hypothesize that this is caused by user expectations and beliefs. A multi-method approach is proposed to validate our research model and to understand the cognitive processes triggered by anthropomorphic cues in varying situations. By explaining the identified theoretical contradiction and providing design suggestions, we derive meaningful insights for both researchers and practitioners.",0,0,0
"COCrIP: Compliant OmniCrawler in-pipeline robot
This paper presents a modular in-pipeline climbing robot with a novel compliant foldable OmniCrawler mechanism. The robot has a series of 3 compliant foldable OmniCrawler modules interconnected by links via passive joints. The circular cross-section of the module enables a holonomic motion to facilitate the alignment of the robot in the direction of bends. Additionally, the crawler mechanism provides a fair amount of traction, even on slippery pipe surfaces. These advantages of crawler modules have been further augmented by incorporating active compliance in the module, which helps to negotiate sharp bends in small diameter pipes. Introducing compliance in the crawler module with a single chain-lugs assembly is the the key novelty of this design. For the desirable pipe diameter and curvature of the bends, the spring stiffness value for each passive joint is determined by formulating a constrained optimization problem using the quasi-static model of the robot. Moreover, a minimum friction coefficient value between the module-pipe surface which can be vertically climbed by the robot without slipping is estimated. The numerical simulation results have further been validated by experiments on real robot prototype.",0,0,1
"Review—""Knees"" in Lithium-Ion Battery Aging Trajectories

 Lithium-ion batteries can last many years but sometimes exhibit rapid, nonlinear degradation that severely limits battery lifetime. Here, we review prior work on “knees” in lithium-ion battery aging trajectories. We first review definitions for knees and three classes of “internal state trajectories” (termed snowball, hidden, and threshold trajectories) that can cause a knee. We then discuss six knee “pathways”, including lithium plating, electrode saturation, resistance growth, electrolyte and additive depletion, percolation-limited connectivity, and mechanical deformation, some of which have internal state trajectories with signals that are electrochemically undetectable. We also identify key design and usage sensitivities for knees. Finally, we discuss challenges and opportunities for knee modeling and prediction. Our findings illustrate the complexity and subtlety of lithium-ion battery degradation and can aid both academic and industrial efforts to improve battery lifetime.",0,0,1

"ViscoCam: Smartphone-based Drink Viscosity Control Assistant for Dysphagia Patients
Dysphagia patients need to carefully control their intake liquid’s viscosity to reduce choking and aspiration risks. However, accurate liquid viscosity measurement requires expensive rheometers still unavailable in daily life. Though the existing approximate testing methods are low-cost, they are not convenient for everyday use as they require either tedious procedures or dedicated apparatus. This paper presents ViscoCam, the first liquid viscosity classification system for dysphagia patients or carers, which only requires a smartphone. It is easy to operate, widely deployable, and robust for daily use. ViscoCam classifies visually indistinguishable liquid of various viscosity levels by exploiting the fact that the sloshing motion of viscous liquid decays faster than thin liquid. To perform a measurement, the user shakes a cup of liquid and their smartphone to induce the liquid sloshing motion. Then, ViscoCam senses the cup’s motion using the smartphone’s built-in accelerometer or microphone and infers liquid viscosity from the fluid surface motion captured by flashlight camera. To combat changes in camera position, lighting conditions, and liquid sloshing motion, a 3D convolutional neural network is trained to extract reliable motion features for classification. We evaluate ViscoCam’s performance in classifying three levels in the IDDSI standard, which is the most up-to-date and internationally adopted one for dysphagia patients. Results show that ViscoCam achieves an overall accuracy of 96.52% in controlled cases. It is robust to unseen liquid heights or container sizes, and >81% accuracy is maintained under extreme testing cases.",0,1,1
"Integrated Optimization of Ascent Trajectory and SRM Design of Multistage Launch Vehicles
This paper presents a methodology for the concurrent first-stage preliminary design and ascent trajectory optimization, with application to a Vega-derived Light Launch Vehicle. The reuse as first stage of an existing upper-stage (Zefiro 40) requires a propellant grain geometry redesign, in order to account for the mutated operating conditions. An optimization code based on the parallel running of several Differential Evolution algorithms is used to find the optimal internal pressure law during Z40 operation, together with the optimal thrust direction and other relevant flight parameters of the entire ascent trajectory. Payload injected into a target orbit is maximized, while respecting multiple design constraints, either involving the alone solid rocket motor or dependent on the actual flight trajectory. Numerical results for SSO injection are presented.",0,0,1

"The Hidden Geometry of Complex, Network-Driven Contagion Phenomena
Predicting Disease Dissemination In combating the global spread of an emerging infectious disease, answers must be obtained to three crucial questions: Where did the disease emerge? Where will it go next? When will it arrive? Brockmann and Helbing (p. 1337; see the Perspective by McLean) analyzed disease spread via the “effective distance” rather than geographical distance, wherein two locations that are connected by a strong link are effectively close. The approach was successfully applied to predict disease arrival times or disease source using data from the the 2003 SARS viral epidemic, 2009 H1N1 influenza pandemic, and the 2011 foodborne enterohaemorrhagic Escherichia coli outbreak in Germany. A model based on effective rather than geographical distance can reveal the origin, timing, and likely spread of epidemics. [Also see Perspective by McLean] The global spread of epidemics, rumors, opinions, and innovations are complex, network-driven dynamic processes. The combined multiscale nature and intrinsic heterogeneity of the underlying networks make it difficult to develop an intuitive understanding of these processes, to distinguish relevant from peripheral factors, to predict their time course, and to locate their origin. However, we show that complex spatiotemporal patterns can be reduced to surprisingly simple, homogeneous wave propagation patterns, if conventional geographic distance is replaced by a probabilistically motivated effective distance. In the context of global, air-traffic–mediated epidemics, we show that effective distance reliably predicts disease arrival times. Even if epidemiological parameters are unknown, the method can still deliver relative arrival times. The approach can also identify the spatial origin of spreading processes and successfully be applied to data of the worldwide 2009 H1N1 influenza pandemic and 2003 SARS epidemic.",0,0,0
"Uncovering near-wall blood flow from sparse data with physics-informed neural networks
Near-wall blood flow and wall shear stress (WSS) regulate major forms of cardiovascular disease, yet they are challenging to quantify with high fidelity. Patient-specific computational and experimental measurement of WSS suffers from uncertainty, low resolution, and noise issues. Physics-informed neural networks (PINN) provide a flexible deep learning framework to integrate mathematical equations governing blood flow with measurement data. By leveraging knowledge about the governing equations (herein, Navier-Stokes), PINN overcomes the large data requirement in deep learning. In this study, it was shown how PINN could be used to improve WSS quantification in diseased arterial flows. Specifically, blood flow problems where the inlet and outlet boundary conditions were not known were solved by assimilating very few measurement points. Uncertainty in boundary conditions is a common feature in patient-specific computational fluid dynamics models. It was shown that PINN could use sparse velocity measurements away from the wall to quantify WSS with very high accuracy even without full knowledge of the boundary conditions. Examples in idealized stenosis and aneurysm models were considered demonstrating how partial knowledge about the flow physics could be combined with partial measurements to obtain accurate near-wall blood flow data. The proposed hybrid data-driven and physics-based deep learning framework has high potential in transforming high-fidelity near-wall hemodynamics modeling in cardiovascular disease.",0,0,1
"Automatic Crack Detection and Inpainting
Abstract— Image inpainting is the process of restoring the lost or damaged regions or modifying the image contents imperceptibly. It refers to the process of filling-in missing data in a designated region of the visual input. In this paper, the technique presented is for detection and removal of cracks from digitized paintings. Crack detection is done automatically by using bottom-hat morphological operation and median filtering is applied only on crack pixels for filling the cracks. We have found PSNR (peak signal to noise ratio)of the images in which the cracks are restored by applying median filtering only on crack pixels and compared the results with the other approach which restores crack by applying median filtering technique on whole crack image.",0,0,1
"Affordances in Robotic Tasks - A Survey
Affordances are key attributes of what must be perceived by an autonomous robotic agent in order to effectively interact with novel objects. Historically, the concept derives from the literature in psychology and cognitive science, where affordances are discussed in a way that makes it hard for the definition to be directly transferred to computational specifications useful for robots. This review article is focused specifically on robotics, so we discuss the related literature from this perspective. In this survey, we classify the literature and try to find common ground amongst different approaches with a view to application in robotics. We propose a categorisation based on the level of prior knowledge that is assumed to build the relationship among different affordance components that matter for a particular robotic task. We also identify areas for future improvement and discuss possible directions that are likely to be fruitful in terms of impact on robotics practice.",0,1,0

Controlling nonlinear dynamics arise in various engineering ﬁelds. Recently proposed methods encode desired control signals into neural networks using losses for nonlinear dynamic control, adopting physics-informed neural networks. We introduce one such method called physics-informed deep operator control (PIDOC). We present efforts to control the chaotic, nonlinear, forced van der Pol system using PIDOC compared to benchmark methods including idealized nonlinear feedforward (FF) control, linearized feedback control (FB), and feed-forward-plus-feedback combined (C). The aim is to implement circular trajectories in the state space of the van der Pol system with applications in computer circuits, robotics, aortic blood ﬂow, etc. A designed benchmark problem is used for testing the behavioral differences of the disparate controllers and then investigating controlled schemes and systems of various extents of nonlinearities. All methods exhibit a transient initialization accompanying arbitrary initialization points. The feedforward control successfully converges to the desired trajectory, and PIDOC executes good controls with higher stochasticity observed for higher-order terms based on the phase portraits, while linearized feedback control and combined feedforward plus feedback failed. Varying trajectory amplitudes revealed that feed-forward, linearized feedback control, and combined feed-forward plus feedback control all fail for unity nonlinear damping gain. Traditional control methods display a robust ﬂuctuation for higher-order terms. For some various nonlinearities, PIDOC failed to implement the desired trajectory, instead of becoming ""trapped"" in the phase of small radius, yet idealized nonlinear feedforward successfully implemented controls. PIDOC exhibits generally lower relative errors for varying targeted trajectories. However, PIDOC also shows evidently higher computational burden compared with traditional control theory methods, with at least more than 30 times longer control time compared with benchmark idealized nonlinear feed-forward control. This manuscript proposes a comprehensive comparative study for future controller employment considering deterministic and machine learning approaches.",0,1,1

"Nonlinear damping quantification from phase-resonant tests under base excitation
The present work addresses the experimental identiﬁcation of amplitude-dependent modal parameters (modal frequency, damping ratio, Fourier coeﬃcients of periodic modal oscillation). Phase-resonant testing has emerged as an important method for this task, as it substantially reduces the amount of data required for the identiﬁcation compared to conventional frequency-response testing at diﬀerent excitation/response levels. In the case of shaker-stinger excitation, the applied excitation force is commonly measured in order to quantify the amplitude-dependent modal damping ratio from the phase-resonant test data. In the case of base excitation, however, the applied excitation force is challenging or impossible to measure. In this work we develop an original method for damping quantiﬁcation from phase-resonant tests. It relies solely on response measurement; it avoids the need to resort to force measurement. The key idea is to estimate the power provided by the distributed inertia force imposed by the base motion. We develop both a model-free and a model-based variant of the method. We validate the developed method ﬁrst in virtual experiments of a friction-damped and a geometrically nonlinear system, and then in a physical experiment involving a thin beam clamped at both ends via bolted joints. We conclude that the method is highly robust and provides high accuracy already for a reasonable number of sensors.",1,1,1

With the comprehensive construction of high-speed railway and deepening reform of the railway freight transportation, high-speed railway is labeled with safe, fast, punctual and other features, which will bring infinite possibility for the railway freight transportation, therefore the research of fast freight trains on high-speed railway is a meaningful exploration.

"Dynamic Modeling, Simulation, and Testing of a Marine DC Hybrid Power System
The hybridization of power systems offers the low-emission and energy-efficient marine vessels. However, it increases the complexity of the power system. Design, analysis, control, and optimization of such a sophisticated system require reliable and efficient modeling tools to cover a wide range of applications. In this work, a typical dc hybrid power system model is developed using a bond graph modeling approach. Necessary component models of varying degrees of fidelity are developed and integrated to build a system model with reasonable accuracy. The developed system model, along with the rule-based energy management system, is used to simulate the entire system and to investigate the load-sharing strategies, as well as the system stability in various operating scenarios. Moreover, the simulation results are validated with experimental results conducted on a full-scale laboratory setup of the dc hybrid power system and with a ship load profile. The results show that the system model is capable of capturing the fundamental dynamics of the real system. The hybrid power system model is further used to analyze the bus voltage deviation from its nominal value. The computational efficiency presented by the system is fairly good as it can simulate faster than real-time. The developed system model can be used to build up a comprehensive simulation platform for different system analysis and control designs.",0,1,1

"MAC: Merging Assemblies by Using Adjacency Algebraic Model and Classification
With the generation of a large amount of sequencing data, different assemblers have emerged to perform de novo genome assembly. As a single strategy is hard to fit various biases of datasets, none of these tools outperforms the others on all species. The process of assembly reconciliation is to merge multiple assemblies and generate a high-quality consensus assembly. Several assembly reconciliation tools have been proposed. However, the existing reconciliation tools cannot produce a merged assembly which has better contiguity and contains less errors simultaneously, and the results of these tools usually depend on the ranking of input assemblies. In this study, we propose a novel assembly reconciliation tool MAC, which merges assemblies by using the adjacency algebraic model and classification. In order to solve the problem of uneven sequencing depth and sequencing errors, MAC identifies consensus blocks between contig sets to construct an adjacency graph. To solve the problem of repetitive region, MAC employs classification to optimize the adjacency algebraic model. What’s more, MAC designs an overall scoring function to solve the problem of unknown ranking of input assembly sets. The experimental results from four species of GAGE-B demonstrate that MAC outperforms other assembly reconciliation tools.",0,1,0
"Dynamic Virtual Power Plant: A New Concept for Grid Integration of Renewable Energy Sources
The concept of Virtual Power Plant (VPP) has arisen over a decade ago from the relatively low competitiveness of the back then emerging non-dispatchable RES. A set of smaller generators imitates the behavior of large synchronous generators. So far, static aspects such as generation or slow dynamics have been of interest, as it is the case for the zonal secondary frequency control scheme in Spain, which can be viewed as a VPP. However, considering dynamic aspects is of high importance, especially to further increase the current penetration level of Renewable Energy Sources (RES). Indeed, one should deal with the full participation of RES in grid ancillary services. This means not only to get some positive impact on grid voltage and frequency dynamics but to bring concepts which allow integrating RES to existing secondary regulation schemes on the same level as classic synchronous generators. For that, we propose here a new concept called Dynamic VPP (DVPP) which fully integrates the dynamic aspects at all levels: locally (for each RES generator), globally (for grid ancillary services and interaction with other close-by elements of the grid) and economically (for internal optimal dispatch and participation in electricity markets). A DVPP is a set of dispatchable and non-dispatchable RES along with a set of common control and operation procedures. The latter procedures include the choice of dispatchable and non-dispatchable RES constituting the DVPP, the control of DVPP generators for local objectives and participation of the DVPP as a single unit in ancillary services (especially in case of loss of natural resources - e.g., wind, sun - on a part of the DVPP), the limitation of the risk of adversely interaction with close-by elements and the feasibility in both current power systems scenarios and future ones with large share of RES. This new DVPP framework and approaches developed for its implementation allows ensuring optimal operation of a mixed portfolio of dispatchable and non-dispatchable RES generators for planning, participation to the markets and real-time control. For the control, all time-scale dynamics are considered to improve RES management (internal re-dispatch inside the DVPP to take advantage of dispatchable/non-dispatchable nature of each RES and to optimally manage the lack of natural resources in some regions of the DVPP) and their participation to grid ancillary services. Concrete structures of DVPP as well as ways to address the other control and economical aspects will be shown. This new DVPP concept is now under development in the H2020 POSYTYF project (https://posytyf-h2020.eu/).",1,1,1

We present an improved fabrication process for overlapping aluminum gate quantum dot devices on Si/SiGe heterostructures that incorporates low-temperature inter-gate oxidation, thermal annealing of gate oxide, on-chip electrostatic discharge (ESD) protection and an optimized interconnect process for thermal budget considerations. This process reduces gate-to-gate leakage, damage from ESD, dewetting of aluminum and formation of undesired alloys in device interconnects. Additionally, cross-sectional scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) images elucidate gate electrode morphology in the active region as device geometry is varied.

"Boundary-Layer Linear Stability Theory
Most fluid flows are turbulent rather than laminar and the reason for this was studied. One of the earliest explanations was that laminar flow is unstable, and the linear instability theory was first developed to explore this possibility. A series of early papers by Rayleigh produced many notable results concerning the instability of inviscid flows, such as the discovery of inflectional instability. Viscosity was commonly thought to act only to stabilize the flow, and flows with convex velocity profiles appeared to be stable. The investigations that led to a viscous theory of boundary layer instability was reported. The earliest application of linear stability theory to transition prediction calculated the amplitude ratio of the most amplified frequency as a function of Reynolds number for a Blasius boundary layer, and found that this quantity had values between five and nine at the observed Ret. The experiment of Schubauer and Skramstad (1947) completely reversed the prevailing option and fully vindicated the Gottingen proponents of the theory. This experiment demonstrated the existence of instability waves in a boundary layer, their connection with transition, and the quantitative description of their behavior by the theory of Tollmien and Schlichting. It is generally accepted that flow parameters such as pressure gradient, suction and heat transfer qualitatively affect transition in the manner predicted by the linear theory, and in particular that a flow predicted to be stable by the theory should remain laminar. The linear theory, in the form of the e9, or N-factor is today in routine use in engineering studies of laminar flow. The stability theory to boundary layers with pressure gradients and suction was applied. The only large body of numerical results for exact boundary layer solutions before the advent of the computer age by calculating the stability characteristics of the Falkner-Skan family of velocity profiles are given. When the digital computer reached a stage of development which permit the direct solution of the primary differential equations, numerical results were obtained from the linear theory during the next 10 years for many different boundary layer flows: three dimensional boundary layers; free convention boundary layers; compressible boundary layers; boundary layers on compliant walls; a recomputation of Falkner-Skan flows; unsteady boundary layers; and heated wall boundary layers.",0,1,1
"A FIXED CASCADE CONTROLLER WITH AN ADAPTIVE DEAD-ZONE COMPENSATION SCHEME APPLIED TO A HYDRAULIC ACTUATOR
This paper addresses the position trajectory contro l of a hydraulic actuator by combining a fixed cascade con troller including the valve dynamic with an adaptive dead-z one compensation scheme. Amongst the hydraulic actuators nonlinearities, the valve dead-zone is one of the m ain position error sources in the hydraulic actuator closed loop control. The dead-zone compensation scheme used here is based on the dead-zone inverse. As the dead-zone breakpoints depend on the system operation point and they vary for eac h valve, one uses an adaptation law to estimate those points , in such a way that the proposed algorithm does not need manual procedures to identify the dead-zone breakpoints. I n addition, the adaptation scheme allows the system to work in different points of operation.

"Overcoming the Force Limitations of Magnetic Robotic Surgery: Impact-based Tetherless Suturing
Magnetic robotics obviate the physical connections between the actuators and end effectors resulting in ultra-minimally invasive surgeries. Even though such a wireless actuation method is highly advantageous in medical applications, the trade-off between the applied force and miniature magnetic end effector dimensions has been one of the main challenges in practical applications in clinically relevant conditions. This trade-off is crucial for applications where in-tissue penetration is required (e.g., needle access, biopsy, and suturing). To increase the forces of such magnetic miniature end effectors to practically useful levels, we propose an impact-force-based suturing needle that is capable of penetrating into in-vitro and ex-vivo samples with 3-DoF planar freedom (planar positioning and in-plane orienting). The proposed optimized design is a custom-built 12 G needle that can generate 1.16 N penetration force which is 56 times stronger than its magnetic counterparts with the same size without such an impact force. By containing the fast moving permanent magnet within the needle in a confined tubular structure, the movement of the overall needle remains slow and easily controllable. The achieved force is in the range of tissue penetration limits allowing the needle to be able to penetrate through tissues to follow a suturing method in a teleoperated fashion. We demonstrated in-vitro needle penetration into a bacon strip and successful suturing of a gauze mesh onto an agar gel mimicking a hernia repair procedure.",0,0,1
"Estimating Wireless Link Quality using Multiple Remote Sensors for Wireless Control of AGV in a Factory
In recent days, various types of wireless communication-based equipment such as Automated Guided Vehicles (AGV) have been used to achieve enhancement of productivity and factory automation. Wireless communication networks are promising for a flexible factory where frequent reconfiguration occurs whereas communication quality and reliability may be the issues for their utilization. Our goal is that the spectrum management system monitors the state of the radio link quality and takes measures to avoid the failure of AGV communication before it occurs. This study showed the results of applying the estimation method of communication quality to the sensing results before the communication starts. We verified a method to determine the best-quality Access Points (APs) in advance by using a group of sensors, located in the space near and around the AP and AGV communication locations, to monitor spectrum usage and predict the communication quality of the links between the APs and the AGV. Experiment results confirmed that packet retransmission rates could be reduced over 35% by using the proposed method of selecting best AP instead of the common method based on largest signal strength.",0,0,0
"An adaptive approach to vehicle trajectory prediction using multimodel Kalman filter
With the aim to improve road safety services in critical situations, vehicle trajectory and future location prediction are important tasks. An infinite set of possible future trajectories can exit depending on the current state of vehicle motion. In this paper, we present a multimodel‐based Extended Kalman Filter (EKF), which is able to predict a set of possible scenarios for vehicle future location. Five different EKF models are proposed in which the current state of a vehicle exists, particularly, a vehicle at intersection or on a curve path. EKF with Interacting Multiple Model framework is explored combinedly for mathematical model creation and probability calculation for that model to be selected for prediction. Three different parameters are considered to create a state vector matrix, which includes vehicle position, velocity, and distance of the vehicle from the intersection. Future location of a vehicle is then used by the software‐defined networking controller to further enhance the safety and packet delivery services by the process of flow rule installation intelligently to that specific area only. This way of flow rule installation keeps the controller away from irrelevant areas to install rules, hence, reduces the network overhead exponentially. Proposed models are created and tested in MATLAB with real‐time global positioning system logs from Jeju, South Korea.",0,0,1
"Robust stability analysis of DC microgrids with constant power loads
This paper studies stability analysis of DC microgrids with uncertain constant power loads (CPLs). It is well known that CPLs have negative impedance effects, which may cause instability in a DC microgrid. Existing works often study the stability around a given equilibrium based on some nominal values of CPLs. However, in real applications, the equilibrium of a DC microgrid depends on the loading condition that often changes over time. Different from many previous results, this paper develops a framework that can analyze the DC microgrid stability for a given range of CPLs. The problem is formulated as a robust stability problem of a polytopic uncertain linear system. By exploiting the structure of the problem, we derive a set of sufficient conditions that can guarantee robust stability. The conditions can be efficiently checked by solving a convex optimization problem in polynomial time. The effectiveness and non-conservativeness of the proposed framework are demonstrated using a simulation example.",0,1,1
"Single Event Upset ( SEU ) in SRAM
Radiation in space is potentially hazardous to microelectronic circuits and systems such as spacecraft electronics. Transient effects on circuits and systems from high energetic particles can interrupt electronics operation or crash the systems.

One of the difficulties in designing a suitable control scheme which can achieve accurate trajectory tracking and good control performance is to guarantee the stability and robustness of control system, due to friction forces, external disturbances error, and parameter variations. To deal with this problem, the RBF network is investigated to the joint position control of an n-link robot manipulator. The RBF network is one approach which has shown a great promise in this sort of problems because of its fast learning algorithm and better approximation capabilities. The adaptive RBF network can effectively improve the control performance against large uncertainty of the system. The adaptive turning laws of network parameters are derived using the back-propagation algorithm and the Lyapunov stability theorem, so that the stability of the entire system and the convergence of the weight adaptation are guaranteed. In this control scheme, a robust compensator plays as an auxiliary controller to guarantee the stability and robustness under various environments such as the mass variation, the external disturbances, and modeling uncertainties. Finally, the simulation and experimental results in comparison with adaptive fuzzy and wavelet network control method are provided to verify the effectiveness of the proposed control methodology.",0,1,1
"A discrete-time single-server Poisson queueing game: Equilibria simulated by an agent-based model
This paper considers a discrete-time single-server queue with a single acceptance period for a Poissonian population of homogeneous customers. Customers are served on a first-come first-served (FCFS) basis, and their service times are independent and identically distributed with a general distribution. We assume that each customer chooses her/his arrival-time slot with the goal of minimizing her/his expected waiting time in competition with other customers. For this queueing game, we derive a symmetric (mixed-strategy) Nash equilibrium; that is, an equilibrium arrival-time distribution of homogeneous customers, where their expected waiting times are identical. We also propose an agent-based model, which simulates the dynamics of customers who try to minimize their waiting times for service. Through numerical experiments, we confirm that this agent-based model achieves, in steady state, an arrival-time distribution similar to the equilibrium arrival-time distribution analytically obtained.",0,0,0
"Nanorobotic System for Precise In Situ Three-Dimensional Manufacture of Helical Microstructures
The helical microstructure has been regarded as one of the essential geometrical shapes widely utilized in microelectromechanical systems (MEMS) and lab on chip systems. Different manufacture methods for helical microstructures attracted the researchers’ attention due to their respective advantages. Inspired by traditional machining techniques, this letter reports a new manufacture method for accurate three-dimensional (3-D) helical microstructures based on in situ scanning electron microscope (SEM) nanorobotic manipulation system.

"A cut-and-fold self-sustained compliant oscillator for autonomous actuation of origami-inspired robots
Origami-inspired robots are of particular interest due to their potential for rapid and accessible design and fabrication of elegant designs and complex functionalities through cutting and folding of flexible two-dimensional sheets or even strings, that is, printable manufacturing. Yet, origami robots still require bulky rigid components or electronics for actuation and control to accomplish tasks with reliability, programmability, ability to output substantial force, and durability, restricting their full potential. In this study, we present a printable self-sustained compliant oscillator that generates periodic actuation using only constant electrical power, without discrete components or electronic control hardware. This oscillator is robust (9 out of 10 prototypes worked successfully on the first try), configurable (with tunable periods from 3 to 12 s), powerful (can overcome hydrodynamic resistance to consistently propel a swimmer at ∼1.6 body lengths/min or 3.66 mm/s), and long lasting (∼103 cycles); it enables driving macroscale devices with prescribed autonomous behaviors, for example, locomotion and sequencing. This oscillator is also fully functional underwater and in high magnetic fields. Our analytical model characterizes essential parameters of the oscillation period, enabling programmable design of the oscillator. The printable oscillator can be integrated into origami-inspired systems seamlessly and monolithically, allowing rapid design and prototyping; the resulting integrated devices are lightweight, low cost, compliant, electronic free, and nonmagnetic, enabling practical applications in extreme areas. We demonstrate the functionalities of the oscillator with: (1) autonomous gliding of a printable swimmer, (2) LED flashing, and (3) fluid stirring. This work paves the way for realizing fully printable autonomous robots with high integration of actuation and control.",0,0,1
"Pas-Mef: Multi-Exposure Image Fusion Based On Principal Component Analysis, Adaptive Well-Exposedness And Saliency Map
High dynamic range (HDR) imaging enables to immortalize natural scenes similar to the way that they are perceived by human observers. With regular low dynamic range (LDR) capture/display devices, significant details may not be preserved in images due to the huge dynamic range of natural scenes. To minimize the information loss and produce high quality HDR-like images for LDR screens, this study proposes an efficient multi-exposure fusion (MEF) approach with a simple yet effective weight extraction method relying on principal component analysis, adaptive well-exposedness and saliency maps. These weight maps are later refined through a guided filter and the fusion is carried out by employing a pyramidal decomposition. Experimental comparisons with existing techniques demonstrate that the proposed method produces very strong statistical and visual results.",0,0,1
"Low Voltage Customer Phase Identification Methods Based on Smart Meter Data
—The increased deployment of distributed energy generation and the integration of new, large electric loads such as electric vehicles and heat pumps challenge the correct and reliable operation of low voltage distribution systems. To tackle potential problems, active management solutions are proposed in the literature, which require distribution system models that include the phase connectivity of all the consumers in the network. However, information on the phase connectivity is in practice often unavailable. In this work, several voltage and power measurement-based phase identiﬁcation methods from the literature are implemented. A consistent comparison of the methods is made across different smart meter accuracy classes and smart meter penetration levels using publicly available data. Furthermore, a novel method is proposed that makes use of ensemble learning and that can combine data from different measurement campaigns. The results indicate that generally better results are obtained with voltage data compared to power data from smart meters of the same accuracy class. If power data is available too, the novel ensemble method can improve the accuracy of the phase identiﬁcation obtained from voltage data alone.",0,0,1

"Simultaneous Transmit and Receive Operation in Next Generation IEEE 802.11 WLANs: A MAC Protocol Design Approach
Full-duplex technology is likely to be adopted in various legacy communications standards. The IEEE 802.11ax Working Group has been considering a simultaneous transmit and receive (STR) mode for the next generation WLANs. Enabling STR mode (FD communication mode) in 802.11 networks creates bidirectional FD (BFD) and unidirectional FD (UFD) links. The key challenge is to integrate STR mode with minimal protocol modifications, while considering the coexistence of FD and legacy half-duplex STAs and backward compatibility. This article proposes a simple and practical approach to enable STR mode in 802.11 networks with coexisting FD and HD STAs. The protocol explicitly accounts for the peculiarities of FD environments and backward compatibility. Key aspects of the proposed solution include FD capability discovery, a handshake mechanism for channel access, node selection for UFD transmission, adaptive ACK timeout for STAs engaged in BFD or UFD transmission, and mitigation of contention unfairness. Performance evaluation demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed solution in realizing the gains of FD technology for next generation WLANs.",0,1,0

"Forced Oscillation Localization in Electric Power Systems under Resonance Conditions
This paper proposes a purely data-driven yet physically interpretable approach to locating the source of forced oscillations in cases where resonance phenomena arise. By leveraging the sparsity of the forced oscillation sources along with the low-rank nature of high-dimensional synchrophasor data, the problem of source localization under resonance conditions is cast as computing the sparse and low-rank components using Robust Principal Component Analysis (RPCA), which can be efficiently solved by the exact Augmented Lagrange Multiplier method. Built upon the RPCA-based problem formulation, an efficient and practically implementable algorithm is developed in order to pinpoint the forced oscillation source during online operation. Additionally, we provide theoretical insights into the efficacy of the proposed approach by use of physical model-based analysis, highlighting the fact that the rank of the resonance matrix is at most 2. The effectiveness of the proposed method is validated in the IEEE 68-bus power system and the WECC 179-bus benchmark system.",0,0,1
"An Exploratory Examination of the Impact of Vacation Policy Structure on Satisfaction, Productivity, and Profitability
Time-off for vacations is a benefit many companies offer as a reward for good work, a chance to relax, and a desirable perquisite to attract new employees. This benefit can come in different forms, but the two most prominent models are paid vacations and a paid time-off (PTO) bank. Paid vacation time means the worker has a certain amount of time allowed for the sole purpose of 34 The BRC Academy Journal of Business Vol. 10, No. 1 taking a vacation away from the workplace. The employer usually supplements this with other forms of time-off such as sick days and/or personal days. The PTO bank is a more flexible model that allows the employee to accrue free time that they can use for any reason; vacation, sick or personal. This paper offers a review of the general benefits of time off, and an overview of the two primary policies. It then statistically compares the vacation timeoff and PTO bank models in terms of employee satisfaction of the policy, and performance at the individual and organizational levels. The paper then explores whether there is a relationship between employee satisfaction of their vacation policy and organizational performance. Results suggest that employees are equally satisfied with the two models, but performance levels vary at both the individual and organizational levels. Independent of policy type, there is a positive correlation between employee satisfaction about their employers’ vacation policy and organizational performance.",0,1,0
"HappyGo: a field trial of local group buying
Group buying is a business model where people with the same merchandise interests form a group and conduct the purchase together to achieve a discount. Third-party proxy websites negotiate with merchants for appealing deals and then provide them to end customers. We call it online group buying. Besides, there exists local group buying where the joiners, the initiator, and sometimes even the merchants are in the same local community. Such locality induces some interesting characteristics in group buying, which remain largely unexplored in the research community. This study attempts to reveal users' behaviors in group buying within the local context. We developed a mobile service called ""HappyGo"" that supports local group buying. We conducted a trial involving more than 300 users from a company office. From our findings, we believe that local group buying complements online group buying by creating a ""local"" economic circle while also providing users with social benefits.",0,1,0

"TDMA in Adaptive Resonant Beam Charging for IoT Devices
Resonant beam charging (RBC) can realize wireless power transfer (WPT) from a transmitter to multiple Internet of Things devices via resonant beams. The adaptive RBC (ARBC) can effectively improve its energy utilization. In order to support multiuser WPT in the ARBC system, we propose the time-division multiple access (TDMA) method and design the TDMA-based WPT scheduling algorithm. Our TDMA WPT method has the features of concurrently charging, continuous charging current, individual user power control, constant driving power, and flexible driving power control. The simulation shows that the TDMA scheduling algorithm has high efficiency, as the total charging time is roughly half (46.9% when charging 50 receivers) of that of the alternative scheduling algorithm. Furthermore, the TDMA for WPT inspires the ideas of enhancing the ARBC system, such as flow control and quality of service.",0,0,1
"Sparse Support Recovery with Phase-Only Measurements
Sparse support recovery (SSR) is an important part of the compressive sensing (CS). Most of the current SSR methods are with the full information measurements. But in practice the amplitude part of the measurements may be seriously destroyed. The corrupted measurements mismatch the current SSR algorithms, which leads to serious performance degeneration. This paper considers the problem of SSR with only phase information. In the proposed method, the minimization of the l1 norm of the estimated sparse signal enforces sparse distribution, while a nonzero constraint of the uncorrupted random measurements' amplitudes with respect to the reconstructed sparse signal is introduced. Because it only requires the phase components of the measurements in the constraint, it can avoid the performance deterioration by corrupted amplitude components. Simulations demonstrate that the proposed phase-only SSR is superior in the support reconstruction accuracy when the amplitude components of the measurements are contaminated.",0,1,1
"Work-from-home and its implication for project management, resilience and innovation - a global survey on software companies
[Context] The COVID-19 pandemic has had a disruptive impact on how people work and collaborate across all global economic sectors, including the software business. While remote working is not new for software engineers, forced Work-from-home situations to come with both constraints, limitations, and opportunities for individuals, software teams and software companies. As the ""new normal"" for working might be based on the current state of Work From Home (WFH), it is useful to understand what has happened and learn from that. [Objective] The goal of this study is to gain insights on how their WFH environment impacts software projects and software companies. We are also interested in understanding if the impact differs between software startups and established companies. [Method] We conducted a global-scale, cross-sectional survey during spring and summer 2021. Our results are based on quantitative and qualitative analysis of 297 valid responses. [Results] We observed a mixed perception of the impact of WFH on software project management, resilience, and innovation. Certain patterns on WFH, control and coordination mechanisms and collaborative tools are observed globally. We find that team, agility and leadership are the three most important factors for achieving resilience during the pandemic. Although startups do not perceive the impact of WFH differently, there is a difference between engineers who work in a small team context and those who work in a large team context.

"Fragility and risk assessment of aboveground storage tanks subjected to concurrent surge, wave, and wind loads
Abstract Comprehensive tools to assess the performance of aboveground storage tanks (ASTs) under multi-hazard storm conditions are currently lacking, despite the severe damage suffered by ASTs in past storms resulting in the release of hazardous substances. This paper presents a rigorous yet efficient methodology to develop fragility models and perform risk assessments of ASTs subjected to combined surge, wave, and wind loads. Parametrized fragility models are derived for buckling and dislocation from the ground. The buckling strength of ASTs is assessed using finite element analysis, while the stability against dislocation is evaluated using analytical limit state functions with surrogate modeling-based load models. Scenario and probabilistic risk assessments are then performed for a case study region by convolving the fragility models with hazard models. Results demonstrate that the derived fragility models are efficient tools to evaluate the performance of ASTs in industrial regions. Insights obtained from the fragility and risk assessments reveal that neglecting the multi-hazard nature of storms, as existing studies have done, can lead to a significant underestimation of vulnerability and risks. This paper also highlights how using surrogate model techniques can facilitate and reduce the computational complexity of fragility and risk assessments, particularly in multi-hazard settings.",0,1,1

Models for wind disturbances, quadrotor dynamics in wind and onboard measurements are presented and an estimation algorithm is developed for the current wind velocity experienced by the vehicle. This wind estimate is used to improve positioning accuracy by both eliminating the eect of wind on the feedback position control law and adding a wind compensator to mitigate the eect of the expected wind disturbance.

"Applications of Robots for COVID-19 Response
This paper reviews 262 reports appearing between March 27 and July 4, 2020, in the press, social media, and scientific literature describing 203 instances of actual use of 104 different models of ground and aerial robots for the COVID19 response. The reports are organized by stakeholders and work domain into a novel taxonomy of six application categories, reflecting major differences in work envelope, adoption strategy, and human-robot interaction constraints. Each application category is further divided into a total of 30 subcategories based on differences in mission. The largest number of reported instances were for public safety (74 out of 203) and clinical care (46), though robots for quality of life (27), continuity of work and education (22), laboratory and supply chain automation (21), and non-clinical care (13) were notable. Ground robots were used more frequently (119) than aerial systems (84), but unlike ground robots, aerial applications appeared to take advantage of existing general purpose platforms that were used for multiple applications and missions. Of the 104 models of robots, 82 were determined to be commercially available or already existed as a prototype, 11 were modifications to existing robots, 11 were built from scratch. Teleoperation dominated the control style (105 instances), with the majority of those applications intentionally providing remote presence and thus not amenable to full autonomy in the future. Automation accounted for 74 instances and taskable agency forms of autonomy, 24. The data suggests areas for further research in autonomy, human-robot interaction, and adaptability.",0,1,0

"A novel buckling pattern in periodically porous elastomers with applications to elastic wave regulations
This paper proposes a new metamaterial structure consisting of a periodically porous elastomer with pore coatings. This design enables us to engender finite deformation by a contactless load. As a case study, we apply thermal load to the pore coating and carry out a finite element analysis to probe instabilities and the associated phononic properties. It turns out that a novel buckling mode, preserving the nature of surface wrinkling in tubular structures, can be induced under a plane-strain setup, and a smaller size of the unit cell is attained compared to the counterpart of traditional buckled profile in soft porous elastomers. In particular, this buckling pattern is able to produce several bandgaps in different frequency ranges as the macroscopic mean strain increases. We further introduce a metallic core as local resonator, and the updated metamaterial allows a low-frequency bandgap, the bandgap width of which can be estimated by a simplified theoretical model. As more free parameters are involved in the structure, we perform a detailed parametric study to elucidate the influences of the modulus ratio between coating and matrix, the porosity, the core radius, and the macroscopic mean strain on the buckling initiation and the evolution of bandgap. Remarkably, a stiffer surface coating is prone to enhance the stability of the structure, which is contrary to existing results in film/substrate bilayers. It is expected that the current study could shed light on new insight into pattern formation and wave manipulation in porous elastomers.",0,1,1
"The influence of ship operational profile in the sustainability of ship energy systems
In recent years, the environmental and economic sustainability of the shipping sector has gained great atten-tion due to the imposed environmental legislation and the uncertainty on fuel prices. The extant literature re-view acknowledges the importance of the operational profile in the improvement of ship systems energy effi-ciency. However, there has not been a complete study to identify and measure the impact of the operational profile on the environmental and economic performance of ship energy systems. In this paper, the influence of the ship operational profile on the sustainability performance of the main ship energy systems is investigated. Different operational profiles are implemented and the resulting economic and environmental impact of the main engine, the thermal boilers and the auxiliary engines of an Aframax tanker ship are analysed over the ship’s operational life cycle. Varying the speed distribution affects both the transportation time for a specific voyage as well as the number of voyages per year. Considering these parameters a complete estimation of the emissions emitted, the fuel consumption, the operational costs and the profits from the cargo transportation are estimated for each profile. The results show that even with small shifts in the speed distribution the differ-ences on the sustainability indicators are significant. Therefore, the operational profile needs to be considered in the early design phases when the synthesis of the energy systems takes place, in order to achieve significant improvement on the systems environmental and economic sustainability performance",0,1,0
"Improving test automation maturity: A multivocal literature review
Mature test automation is key for achieving software quality at speed. In this paper, we present a multivocal literature review with the objective to survey and synthesize the guidelines given in the literature for improving test automation maturity. We selected and reviewed 81 primary studies, consisting of 26 academic literature and 55 grey literature sources.

We made main observations: (1) There are only six best practices whose positive effect on maturity improvement have been evaluated by academic studies using formal empirical methods; (2) several technical related best practices in this MLR were not presented in test maturity models; (3) some best practices can be linked to success factors and maturity impediments proposed by other scholars; (4) most pieces of advice on how to conduct proposed best practices were identified from experience studies and their effectiveness need to be further evaluated with cross‐site empirical evidence using formal empirical methods; (5) in the literature, some advice on how to conduct certain best practices are conflicting, and some advice on how to conduct certain best practices still need further qualitative analysis.",0,0,0
"Efficient codebook-based MIMO beamforming for millimeter-wave WLANs
Beamforming is a critical and natural solution for 60 GHz band wireless communications due to the increased signal attenuation. In this paper we propose an efficient codebook-based MIMO beamforming training scheme for estimating the antenna weight vectors (AWVs) in millimeter-wave wireless local area networks (WLANs). We adopt the discrete Fourier transform (DFT)-based codebooks. We propose a simple and efficient iterative AWVs training algorithm that uses only one AWV feedback to obtain the best transmit (TX) and receive (RX) AWVs pair. Instead of initial selection of multiple TX and RX AWVs in the IEEE 802.11ad draft standard, we only select the best TX AWV and RX AWV for subsequent refinement. The beam pattern search for refinement is limited only to the region corresponding to the best TX AWV and RX AWV from initial selection and their angular rotated adjacent beams. To verify the performance we compare our proposed scheme with the one specified in the IEEE 802.11ad in terms of the beam gains and show that our proposed scheme outperforms the one in the IEEE 802.11ad even using the fewer beamforming training time.",0,0,0

The modeling procedure is established by integrating the material database into a woven CFRP structural numerical model, formulating a concurrent 3-scale modeling framework. This framework provides an accurate prediction for the structural performance (e.g., nonlinear structural behavior under tensile load), as well as the woven and UD physics field evolution. The concurrent modeling results are validated against physical tests that link structural performance to the basic material microstructures. The proposed methodology provides a comprehensive predictive modeling procedure applicable to general composite materials aiming to reduce laborious experiments needed.",0,1,1

"Estimation of the centre of mass from motion capture and force plate recordings: A study on the elderly
The estimation of the centre of mass position in humans is usually based on biomechanical models developed from anthropometric tables. This method can potentially introduce errors in studies involving elderly people, since the ageing process is typically associated with a modification of the distribution of the body mass. In this paper, an alternative technique is proposed, and evaluated with an experimental study on 9 elderly volunteers. The technique is based on a virtual chain, identified from experimental data and locating the subject's centre of mass. Its configuration defines the location of the centre of mass, and is a function of the anatomical joint angles measured on the subject. This method is a valuable investigation tool in the field of geronto-technology, since it overcomes some of the problems encountered with other CoM estimation methods.",0,0,1
"A Daily Field Investigation of Technology-Driven Spillovers from Work to Home
Although recent theoretical developments and empirical studies indicate that technology-related stress may have negative and positive consequences for employees across life domains, the majority of previous IS research on technostress has focused on its downsides at work and has neglected to study how and why technology-related stress may spill over from work to home. Furthermore, while much of our knowledge of technology-related stress and its effects derives from cross-sectional studies examining between-person differences, there is a need for longitudinal, daily investigations that take a within-person view. Integrating the challenge–hindrance stressor framework with affective events theory and work–home spillover literature, we propose a broader conceptualization of technology-related stressors, referred to as technology-driven (TD) stressors, which comprise technology-driven challenge (TCS) and hindrance (THS) stressors, and examine how and why daily TCS and THS experienced at work affect the relationship between employees and their partners at home. In an experience sampling study of 115 employees who responded to daily surveys both at work and at home over a two-week period, we found that while THS are negatively related to partnership satisfaction via negative affect, TCS are positively related to partnership satisfaction via positive affect. We also investigated the moderating effect of work–home role integration (WHI) and perceived organizational support in work–home boundary management (POS) on the strength of the within-individual spillover processes. Our results show that WHI acts as a double-edged sword for letting TCS- and THS-triggered positive and negative affect spill over to partnership satisfaction, whereas POS serves as a facilitator of positive affect and as a buffer against negative affect. Broadly, our study shows that understanding daily TD work stressors is important because their negative and positive downstream effects often do not stop at employees’ workplace boundaries but actually penetrate and shape their everyday lives at home.",0,0,0
"A review of combined wave and offshore wind energy
The sustainable development of the offshore wind and wave energy sectors requires optimising the exploitation of the resources, and it is in relation to this and the shared challenge for both industries to reduce their costs that the option of integrating offshore wind and wave energy arose during the past decade. The relevant aspects of this integration are addressed in this work: the synergies between offshore wind and wave energy, the different options for combining wave and offshore wind energy, and the technological aspects. Because of the novelty of combined wave and offshore wind systems, a comprehensive classification was lacking. This is presented in this work based on the degree of integration between the technologies, and the type of substructure. This classification forms the basis for the review of the different concepts. This review is complemented with specific sections on the state of the art of two particularly challenging aspects, namely the substructures and the wave energy conversion.",0,1,1

"Using a random road graph model to understand road networks robustness to link failures
Abstract Disruptions to the transport system have a greater impact on society and the economy now than ever before due to the increased interconnectivity and interdependency of the economic sectors. The ability of transport systems to maintain functionality despite various disturbances (i.e. robustness) is hence of tremendous importance and has been the focus of research seeking to support transport planning, design and management. These approaches and findings may nevertheless be only valid for the specific networks studied. The present study attempts to find universal insights into road networks robustness by exploring the correlation between different network attributes and network robustness to single, multiple, random and targeted link failures. For this purpose, the common properties of road graphs were identified through a literature review. On this basis, the GREREC model was developed to randomly generate a variety of abstract networks presenting the topological and operational characteristics of real-road networks, on which a robustness analysis was performed. This analysis quantifies the difference between the link criticality rankings when only single-link failures are considered as opposed to when multiple-link failures are considered and the difference between the impact of targeted and random attacks. The influence of the network attributes on the network robustness and on these two differences is shown and discussed. Finally, this analysis is also performed on a set of real road networks to validate the results obtained with the artificial networks.",0,1,0
"FRESH 3D Bioprinting a Full-Size Model of the Human Heart.
Recent advances in embedded three-dimensional (3D) bioprinting have expanded the design space for fabricating geometrically complex tissue scaffolds using hydrogels with mechanical properties comparable to native tissues and organs in the human body. The advantage of approaches such as Freeform Reversible Embedding of Suspended Hydrogels (FRESH) printing is the ability to embed soft biomaterials in a thermoreversible support bath at sizes ranging from a few millimeters to centimeters. In this study, we were able to expand this printable size range by FRESH bioprinting a full-size model of an adult human heart from patient-derived magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) data sets. We used alginate as the printing biomaterial to mimic the elastic modulus of cardiac tissue. In addition to achieving high print fidelity on a low-cost printer platform, FRESH-printed alginate proved to create mechanically tunable and suturable models. This demonstrates that large-scale 3D bioprinting of soft hydrogels is possible using FRESH and that cardiac tissue constructs can be produced with potential future applications in surgical training and planning.",0,1,1
"Textile Reinforced Concrete: Design Methodology and Novel Reinforcement
Fibre reinforcement has been used to reinforce concrete members for decades. It has combined well with concrete to help control cracking and increase toughness and other properties such as corrosion resistance. The use of traditional fibre reinforcement has led to the development of a new material called textile reinforcement (multifilament continuous fibre) which can also be used as the main reinforcement instead of steel reinforcement. This study experimentally investigates concrete beams reinforced only with carbon textile material (TRC beams). The tensile strength of textile reinforcement and pull out strength of TRC were measured. Four-point bending tests were performed on 76 beams (small and large scale beams). Several parameters such as volume fraction and reinforcement layout were studied in order to investigate their effect on TRC beam behaviour. The results showed that with the correct layout and geometry of textile reinforcement, these reinforced concrete beams, providing they had sufficient cover thickness, would perform well. Also, the results confirmed that the bond between the concrete and textile reinforcement plays a vital role in TRC beam performance. The behaviour of the TRC beams was compared with that of the steel reinforced concrete (SRC) beams; a major advantage of the TRC beam was the reduced crack widths. 
This study finishes by proposing a design methodology for TRC beams. Guidance covers flexural design, predictions for moment-curvature, and predictions for crack width of TRC beams.",0,0,1
"Accessibility, usability and universal design—positioning and definition of concepts describing person-environment relationships
Purpose : The aim of this paper is to position, define and discuss three concepts crucial for research and practice concerning person-environment relationships, viz. accessibility, usability and universal design. Methods : Literature review, synthesized with the authors' research and practice experiences. Results : The authors suggest an instrumental, three-step definition to accessibility, highlighting that accessibility comprises a personal as well as a environmental component, and that accessibility must be analysed by an integration of both. Suggesting the introduction of an activity component, accessibility should partly be replaced by the more complex term usability. Universal design is highlighted as a more process-oriented but less stigmatizing concept. Conclusion : This paper contributes to the positioning and definition of concepts describing person-environment relationships. The definitions suggested challenge current terminology, but can support in developing more efficient research and practice strategies. In order to develop theory for application to societal planning issues, the definition of concepts is a necessary step.",0,1,0
"Feature-Level Rating System Using Customer Reviews and Review Votes
This work studies how we can obtain feature-level ratings of the mobile products from the customer reviews and review votes to influence decision-making, both for new customers and manufacturers. Such a rating system gives a more comprehensive picture of the product than what a product-level rating system offers. While product-level ratings are too generic, feature-level ratings are particular; we exactly know what is good or bad about the product. There has always been a need to know which features fall short or are doing well according to the customer’s perception. It keeps both the manufacturer and the customer well-informed in the decisions to make in improving the product and buying, respectively. Different customers are interested in different features. Thus, feature-level ratings can make buying decisions personalized. We analyze the customer reviews collected on an online shopping site (Amazon) about various mobile products and the review votes. Explicitly, we carry out a feature-focused sentiment analysis for this purpose. Eventually, our analysis yields ratings to 108 features for 4000+ mobiles sold online. It helps in decision-making on how to improve the product (from the manufacturer’s perspective) and in making the personalized buying decisions (from the buyer’s perspective) a possibility.

"Super-Resolution DOA Estimation for Wideband Signals using Arbitrary Linear Arrays without Focusing Matrices
We focus on developing an effective Direction Of Arrival (DOA) estimation method for wideband sources based on the gridless sparse concept. Previous coherent methods have been designed by dividing wideband frequencies into a few subbands which are transferred to a reference subband using a focusing matrices. In this work, as opposed to the previous techniques, we propose a convex optimization problem that leads to an accurate wideband DOA estimation method with no need for any focusing matrix. Moreover, in this method no initial DOA estimates are required and it can be used for any arbitrary linear arrays. Numerical simulations show that in comparison to some well-known techniques, the proposed method generates outstanding accuracy and better robustness to noise. The effectiveness of the method is also verified in presence of close adjacent sources.

"Augmented Reality-Based Manual Assembly Support With Visual Features for Different Degrees of Difficulty
This research investigates different visual features for augmented reality (AR)–based assembly instructions. Since the beginning of AR research, one of its most popular application areas has been manual assembly assistance. A typical AR assembly application indicates the necessary manual assembly operations by generating visual representations of parts that are spatially registered with, and superimposed on, a video representation of the physical product to be assembled. Research in this area indicates the advantages of this type of assembly instruction presentation. This research investigates different types of visual features for different assembly operations. The hypothesis is that in order to gain an advantage from AR, the visual features used to explain a particular assembly operation must correspond to its relative difficulty level. The final goal is to associate different types of visual features to different levels of task complexity. A user study has been conducted in order to compare different visual features at different operation complexity levels. The results support the hypothesis.",0,1,0
"Short-Term Residential Load Forecasting Based on LSTM Recurrent Neural Network
As the power system is facing a transition toward a more intelligent, flexible, and interactive system with higher penetration of renewable energy generation, load forecasting, especially short-term load forecasting for individual electric customers plays an increasingly essential role in the future grid planning and operation. Other than aggregated residential load in a large scale, forecasting an electric load of a single energy user is fairly challenging due to the high volatility and uncertainty involved. In this paper, we propose a long short-term memory (LSTM) recurrent neural network-based framework, which is the latest and one of the most popular techniques of deep learning, to tackle this tricky issue. The proposed framework is tested on a publicly available set of real residential smart meter data, of which the performance is comprehensively compared to various benchmarks including the state-of-the-arts in the field of load forecasting. As a result, the proposed LSTM approach outperforms the other listed rival algorithms in the task of short-term load forecasting for individual residential households.",0,1,1
"Fractal dynamics in physiology: Alterations with disease and aging
According to classical concepts of physiologic control, healthy systems are self-regulated to reduce variability and maintain physiologic constancy. Contrary to the predictions of homeostasis, however, the output of a wide variety of systems, such as the normal human heartbeat, fluctuates in a complex manner, even under resting conditions. Scaling techniques adapted from statistical physics reveal the presence of long-range, power-law correlations, as part of multifractal cascades operating over a wide range of time scales. These scaling properties suggest that the nonlinear regulatory systems are operating far from equilibrium, and that maintaining constancy is not the goal of physiologic control. In contrast, for subjects at high risk of sudden death (including those with heart failure), fractal organization, along with certain nonlinear interactions, breaks down. Application of fractal analysis may provide new approaches to assessing cardiac risk and forecasting sudden cardiac death, as well as to monitoring the aging process. Similar approaches show promise in assessing other regulatory systems, such as human gait control in health and disease. Elucidating the fractal and nonlinear mechanisms involved in physiologic control and complex signaling networks is emerging as a major challenge in the postgenomic era.",0,1,1

"An approach to improve impedance plethysmography on the wrist by using adaptive feedback control
The growing market of wearable devices made ambulant vital sign monitoring popular in recent years. Impedance plethysmography (IPG) provides a promising low power solution for detecting pulse waves and respiration by measuring the impedance of blood vessels at the wrist. However, the measurement principle makes high demands on the analog front end, due to low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and unknown measurement conditions. In this paper an approach to apply impedance plethysmography is presented.

"A Tendon-Driven Robot Gripper With Passively Switchable Underactuated Surface and its Physics Simulation Based Parameter Optimization
In this letter, we propose a single-actuator gripper that can lift thin objects lying on a flat surface, in addition to the ability as a standard parallel gripper. The key is a crawler on the fingertip, which is underactuated together with other finger joints and switched with a passive and spring-loaded mechanism. While the idea of crawling finger is not a new one, this letter contributes to realize the crawling without additional motor. The gripper can passively change the mode from the parallel approach mode to the pull-in mode, then finally to the power grasp mode, according to the grasping state. To optimize the highly underactuated system, we take a combination of black-box optimization and physics simulation of the whole grasp process. We show that this simulation-based approach can effectively consider the pre-contact motion, in-hand manipulation, power grasp stability, and even failure mode, which is difficult for the static-equilibrium-analysis-based approaches. In the last part of the letter, we demonstrate that a prototype gripper with the proposed structure and design parameters optimized under the proposed process successfully power-grasped a thin sheet, a softcover book, and a cylinder lying on a flat surface.",0,0,1

"Learning to Predict High-Quality Edge Maps for Room Layout Estimation
The goal of room layout estimation is to predict the three-dimensional box that represents the room spatial structure from a monocular image. In this paper, a deconvolution network is trained first to predict the edge map of a room image. Compared to the previous fully convolutional networks, the proposed deconvolution network has a multilayer deconvolution process that can refine the edge map estimate layer by layer. The deconvolution network also has fully connected layers to aggregate the information of every region throughout the entire image. During the layout generation process, an adaptive sampling strategy is introduced based on the obtained high-quality edge maps.

"Practical development of the second-order extended Kalman filter for very long range radar tracking
This paper improves the second-order extended Kalman filter (SOF) by accounting the correlation of the first and second-order terms (FSOT) in the measurement Taylor approximation-a matrix assumed to be zero in the conventional SOF. The goal is to achieve consistent estimation results for very long range radar tracking, whereas this correlation term becomes non-negligible. Remarkably, the range element of the correlation term is so significant that it is several times larger than the range variance of the second-order term (SOT) and four orders of magnitude larger than the variance of the range measurement. In the absence of a closed form expression, the correlation of interest is approximated by scaling the variance of SOT using a design parameter. Improved performance of the new method is shown in simulated tests when the parameter is tuned up using the off-line Monte-Carlo averaging. The proposed SOF can process measurements in either the range-direction-sine (r-u-v) coordinates or the spherical (r-a-e) coordinates.",0,1,1

"IT-Enabled Self-Monitoring for Chronic Disease Self-Management: An Interdisciplinary Review
Self-monitoring is a strategy that patients use to manage their chronic disease and chronic disease risk factors. Technological advances such as mobile apps, web-based tracking programs, sensing devices, wearable technologies, and insideable devices enable IT-based self-monitoring (ITSM) for chronic disease management. Since ITSM is multidisciplinary in nature and our understanding is fragmented, a systematic examination of the literature is performed to build a holistic understanding of the phenomenon. We review 159 studies published in 108 journals and conferences between 2006 and 2017. By adapting affordance actualization theory, we develop an overarching framework to organize the existing literature on ITSM for chronic disease management. Four themes emerge: key ITSM functionalities that enable affordances; effects on ITSM system use; effects on the achievement of chronic care goals; and the role of intermediary outcomes. For each theme, we identify what is known, what is unknown, and opportunities for future research. We also discuss cross-theme opportunities for future research where more diverse theoretical perspectives can contribute to our understanding of the phenomenon. This work provides research directions for IS researchers studying ITSM for chronic disease self-management.",0,0,0
"The State of the Art in Methodologies of Course Recommender Systems - A Review of Recent Research
In recent years, education institutions have offered a wide range of course selections with overlaps. This presents significant challenges to students in selecting successful courses that match their current knowledge and personal goals. Although many studies have been conducted on Recommender Systems (RS), a review of methodologies used in course RS is still insufficiently explored. To fill this literature gap, this paper presents the state of the art of methodologies used in course RS along with the summary of the types of data sources used to evaluate these techniques. This review aims to recognize emerging trends in course RS techniques in recent research literature to deliver insights for researchers for further investigation. We provide a systematic review process followed by research findings on the current methodologies implemented in different course RS in selected research journals such as: collaborative, content-based, knowledge-based, Data Mining (DM), hybrid, statistical and Conversational RS (CRS). This study analyzed publications between 2016 and June 2020, in three repositories; IEEE Xplore, ACM, and Google Scholar. These papers were explored and classified based on the methodology used in recommending courses.

"Bounded distributed flocking control of nonholonomic mobile robots
There have been numerous studies on the problem of flocking control for multiagent systems whose simplified models are presented in terms of point-mass elements. Meanwhile, full dynamic models pose some challenging problems in addressing the flocking control problem of mobile robots due to their nonholonomic dynamic properties. Taking practical constraints into consideration, we propose a novel approach to distributed flocking control of nonholonomic mobile robots by bounded feedback. The flocking control objectives consist of velocity consensus, collision avoidance, and cohesion maintenance among mobile robots. A flocking control protocol that is based on the information of neighbor mobile robots is constructed. The theoretical analysis is conducted with the help of a Lyapunov-like function and graph theory. Simulation results are shown to demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed distributed flocking control scheme.",0,0,1
"A material system with integrated fault diagnosis and feedback controlled self‐healing
Two significant drawbacks of current self‐healing materials are that they are: (1) Passive and as such do not guarantee a match between the healing and damage rate; (2) Not monitored during and after healing, so that the performance of the healed material is not known without retrospective offline testing. As a consequence their application is currently limited in some sectors, such as the aerospace sector where high performance needs to be guaranteed within strict guidelines. This article proposes the first active self‐healing material that integrates with control and fault diagnosis to provide a system with a desired healing response. A fault diagnosis algorithm using supervised regression is used to estimate the measure of damage. Then based on this estimate, adaptive feedback control is used to ensure a match between the healing response and the damage rate, while taking into account the nonlinear system dynamics and uncertainty. The system is demonstrated in simulation using a self‐healing material based on piezoelectricity and electrolysis. This shows the ability of the integrated subsystems to tackle these two significant drawbacks of most current self‐healing systems and will benefit applications with strict performance requirements, or systems operating under harsh conditions or that are remotely accessed.",0,0,1
"Towards the Development of A Three-Dimensional SBP-SAT FDTD Method: Theory and Validation
—To enhance the scalability and performance of the traditional ﬁnite-difference time-domain (FDTD) methods, a three-dimensional summation-by-parts simultaneous approxima- tion term (SBP-SAT) FDTD method is developed to solve complex electromagnetic problems. It is theoretically stable and can be further used for multiple mesh blocks with different mesh sizes. This paper mainly focuses on the fundamental theoretical aspects upon its three-dimensional implementation, the SAT for various boundary conditions, and the numerical dispersion properties and the comparison with the FDTD method. The proposed SBP-SAT FDTD method inherits all the merits of the FDTD method, which is matrix-free, easy to implement, and has the same level of accuracy with a negligible overhead of runtime (0.13%) and memory usage (1.2%).

"COMPARISON OF INFILL SAMPLING CRITERIA IN KRIGING-BASED AERODYNAMIC OPTIMIZATION
Kriging-based optimization methods are of great interest for aerodynamic design optimization where high-fidelity thus timeconsuming computational fluid dynamics (CFD) are used. In the framework of kriging-based optimization, a core technique called sampling infill criteria (also called adaptive sampling) is used both to search the design space and to refine the surrogate models. Among all the infill criteria, expected improvement (EI) is the favorite one while others are also still in use. However, there is little research compared these criteria when kriging-based optimization method is applied in the aerodynamic design optimization. The following paper addresses this issue by investigating 6 types of infill criteria in the drag minimization problem of the RAE2822 airfoil with different number of design variables. For each infill criterion and each number of design variables, the optimization process is repeated 30 times, and the averaged value and standard deviation are compared. The results show that, some criteria can be comparable to EI or even slight better than EI, while some criteria are much worse.",0,1,1

"Advanced RDL Interposer PKG Technology for Heterogeneous Integration
As faster data processing and communication gets more demanded for Data Center/Cloud, HPC (High Performance Computing), AI (Artificial Intelligence) accelerator and Network markets, HBM (High Bandwidth Memory) becomes main memory type to meet the required bandwidth performance. HBM integration with logic dies in a system level has been developed on 2.5D SiP (System in Package) Platform with Si Interposer having TSV (Through Silicon Vias) of which fabrication cost is rather high. Therefore, as the low cost solution, alternative 2.5D SiP Platform approaches such as Organic Interposer using Redistribution Layer (RDL) and Glass Interposer have recently been reported. In this paper, RDL Interposer package with 4 HBM and 1 logic is demonstrated as 2.5D package platform based on RDL-First Fan-out Wafer Level Package (FOWLP). The effect of RDL design factors on electrical performances is investigated using the eye diagram method and fine pitch multi-layer RDL structure (2um L/S RDL, 4 Layers) is designed accordingly. Fine pitch RDL process is established followed by the wafer level and unit level assembly processes and RDL Interposer package is confirmed to meet all the reliability requirements.",0,0,1
"Container Loading for Nonorthogonal Objects with Stability and Load Bearing Strength Compliance
A feasible solution for a container loading problem is the exact order, position and orientation in which the objects are loaded into the container. However, the more constraints are taken into account, the more complex the problem is. Several algorithms have been proposed to load objects with different shapes and taking into account a few constraints. Nevertheless, most of the approaches restrict the shape to be orthogonal (i.e., standard boxes) and constraints like stability or load bearing strength were not considered. The aim of this paper is to provide an approach to solve the problem of loading orthogonal and non-orthogonal boxes, considering them as polyhedral. In addition, our proposal deals with constraints on the dimensions of the container, whether every box can be rotated in any of the three dimensions, the maximum load bearing strength and also the minimum stability required. To solve the problem with the characteristics mentioned above a data structure is proposed to represent the i-th state of the container's loading process by storing the height values and the remaining load bearing strength of the objects inside the container.",0,0,1
"Satellite handover techniques for LEO networks
Low earth orbit satellite constellations could play an important role in future mobile communication networks due to their characteristics, such as global coverage and low propagation delays. However, because of the non‐stationarity of the satellites, a call may be subjected to handovers, which can be cell or satellite handovers. Quite many techniques have been proposed in the literature dealing with the cell handover issue. In this paper, a satellite handover procedure is proposed, that investigates and exploits the partial satellite diversity (namely, the existing common coverage area between contiguous satellites) in order to provide an efficient handover strategy, based always on a tradeoff of blocking and forced termination probabilities for a fair treatment of new and handover calls. Three different criteria were examined for the selection of a satellite. Each one of them could be applied either to new or handover calls, therefore we investigated nine different service schemes. A simulation tool was implemented in order to compare the different service schemes and simulation results are presented at the end of the paper. Copyright © 2004 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.",0,1,0
"Effect of Wideband Beam Squint on Codebook Design in Phased-Array Wireless Systems
Analog beamforming with phased arrays is a promising technique for 5G wireless communication at millimeter wave frequencies. Using a discrete codebook consisting of multiple analog beams, each beam focuses on a certain range of angles of arrival or departure and corresponds to a set of fixed phase shifts across frequency due to practical hardware considerations. However, for sufficiently large bandwidth, the gain provided by the phased array is actually frequency dependent, which is an effect called beam squint, and this effect occurs even if the radiation pattern of the antenna elements is frequency independent. This paper examines the nature of beam squint for a uniform linear array (ULA) and analyzes its impact on codebook design as a function of the number of antennas and system bandwidth normalized by the carrier frequency. The criterion for codebook design is to guarantee that each beam's minimum gain for a range of angles and for all frequencies in the wideband system exceeds a target threshold, for example 3 dB below the array's maximum gain. Analysis and numerical examples suggest that a denser codebook is required to compensate for beam squint. For example, 54% more beams are needed compared to a codebook design that ignores beam squint for a ULA with 32 antennas operating at a carrier frequency of 73 GHz and bandwidth of 2.5 GHz. Furthermore, beam squint with this design criterion limits the bandwidth or the number of antennas of the array if the other one is fixed.",0,1,0
"Coordination and Collaboration: How do Volunteer Moderators Work as a Team in Live Streaming Communities?
Volunteer moderators (mods) play significant roles in developing moderation standards and dealing with harmful content in their micro-communities. However, little work explores how volunteer mods work as a team. In line with prior work about understanding volunteer moderation, we interview 40 volunteer mods on Twitch — a leading live streaming platform. We identify how mods collaborate on tasks (off-streaming coordination and preparation, in-stream real-time collaboration, and relationship building both off-stream and in-stream to reinforce collaboration) and how mods contribute to moderation standards (collaboratively working on the community rulebook and individually shaping community norms). We uncover how volunteer mods work as an effective team. We also discuss how the affordances of multi-modal communication and informality of volunteer moderation contribute to task collaboration, standards development, and mod’s roles and responsibilities.",0,0,0

"Algorithms for the Vehicle Routing and Scheduling Problems with Time Window Constraints
This paper considers the design and analysis of algorithms for vehicle routing and scheduling problems with time window constraints. Given the intrinsic difficulty of this problem class, approximation methods seem to offer the most promise for practical size problems. After describing a variety of heuristics, we conduct an extensive computational study of their performance. The problem set includes routing and scheduling environments that differ in terms of the type of data used to generate the problems, the percentage of customers with time windows, their tightness and positioning, and the scheduling horizon. We found that several heuristics performed well in different problem environments; in particular an insertion-type heuristic consistently gave very good results.",0,0,0
"Improving Influence Operations by Defining Influence and Influence Operations
Abstract : For the foreseeable future, the U.S. military will continue to protect U.S. interests and project power within areas rife with internal conflicts and faltering states. Conditions within such operating environments require land forces to influence populations, adversaries, and other regional or global audiences. However, land forces struggle to operationalize influence, and U.S. influence operations face increasing scrutiny and criticism. This is unsurprising given that U.S. military doctrine lacks a single, official definition for either influence or influence operations. This doctrinal gap causes confusion among both influence practitioners and non-practitioners, and leads to increasingly ineffective influence operations. By asking how influence operations can become more effective, this monograph determines a definition for influence in a military context, an operationally useful definition of influence operations, and the knowledge, skills, abilities, and education of an influence operations planner. Incorporation of these definitions within doctrine will enable more effective landpower projection into unstable areas.",0,1,0
"Configuring A Collaborative Virtual Workspace For Disaster Management Of Oil & Gas Offshore Structures
There are serious risks involved in running offshore units, with many reported disasters. These disasters can not only cause deaths and important environmental impacts, but also have a strong impact on business. Oil & gas companies are thus continuously seeking to employ processes and technologies to respond to such events in order to ensure safety. Such processes involve collaboration among a large number of groups and resources from different natures and geographically distributed, in order to make appropriate decisions within a short period of time. These groups are comprised of many technical experts and decision makers such as naval engineers, structural engineers, risers analysts and oceanographers, as well as managers. They need to be in constant communication with operators inside the unit, divers, security team, and, perhaps, with experts who are travelling to execute the rescue plan. This work investigates how a distributed workspace environment can support disaster management, involving distributed collaborative technical teams. We first identify the requirements for the distributed workspace, from the stakeholders involved in a disaster, and analyse the commercial emergency systems available. We then elaborate a multi-perspective metamodel to support configuring this collaborative virtual workspace. Finally a prototype for oil & gas offshore structures disaster management based on our multi-perspective metamodel is derived and an HLA-compliant implementation for this prototype is developed as a proof-of-concept of the metamodel.",0,0,0

In this paper, radar is discussed in the context of a multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) system model. A comparison is made between MIMO wireless communication and MIMO radar. Examples are given showing that many traditional radar approaches can be interpreted within a MIMO context. Furthermore, exploiting this MIMO perspective, useful extensions to traditional radar can be constructed. Performance advantages in terms of degrees of freedom and resolution are discussed. Finally, a MlMO extension to space-time adaptive processing (STAP) is introduced as applied to ground moving-target indication (GMTI).",0,1,0
"Target Tracking Control of a Biomimetic Underwater Vehicle Through Deep Reinforcement Learning
In this article, the underwater target tracking control problem of a biomimetic underwater vehicle (BUV) is addressed. Since it is difficult to build an effective mathematic model of a BUV due to the uncertainty of hydrodynamics, target tracking control is converted into the Markov decision process and is further achieved via deep reinforcement learning. The system state and reward function of underwater target tracking control are described. Based on the actor–critic reinforcement learning framework, the deep deterministic policy gradient actor–critic algorithm with supervision controller is proposed. The training tricks, including prioritized experience replay, actor network indirect supervision training, target network updating with different periods, and expansion of exploration space by applying random noise, are presented. Indirect supervision training is designed to address the issues of low stability and slow convergence of reinforcement learning in the continuous state and action space. Comparative simulations are performed to show the effectiveness of the training tricks. Finally, the proposed actor–critic reinforcement learning algorithm with supervision controller is applied to the physical BUV. Swimming pool experiments of underwater object tracking of the BUV are conducted in multiple scenarios to verify the effectiveness and robustness of the proposed method.",0,1,1
"PIEZOELECTRIC BASED ENERGY HARVESTER EMBEDDED IN SHOE FOR WEARABLE ELECTRONICS
Piezoelectric based energy harvesting has become a popular research interest for last few years. This is due to the increasing demand for low-powered portable and wearable electronic devices such as health monitoring sensors. This paper presents two polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) based energy harvesters, which can be embedded in shoes to generate electric energy while human walking. One of the harvesters is specially designed as a sandwich structure, placed under the ball of foot, while the other one has curved or oval-shaped structure, placed under the heel of foot. Both harvesters are developed and deployed appropriately in the sole to couple maximum mechanical stress to the piezo-material and achieve high power output. The system was analysed, using mathematical modelling and results are verified by performing experiments in the lab. It has been observed experimentally that sandwich structured harvester produces 4.9 μW across a capacitor of 10 μF while walking at a speed of two step/second (2 Hz). However, for the same capacitor, the curve-shaped harvester produces up to 5.625 μW power. Integrated output power of both energy harvesters was 9.625 μW.",0,0,1
"Identification of Fault Line Selection and Section for Single-Phase Ground Fault in Small Current Grounding System
The fault characteristics of the small current grounding system are not obvious when the fault occurs. Currently, it is hard to accurately select and locate the ground fault in the small current grounding system. Therefore, in this paper, a scheme of fault grounding line selection and location is proposed based on the characteristic of the zero-sequence current matrix. As the zero-sequence current phase always lags behind the zero-sequence voltage when the amplitude of zero-sequence current increases. Based on this, we developed a State Matrix S. It can effectively reflect the degree of each region that is affected by the fault. Based on the State Matrix S, we can draw out the regional fault state value through a formula we created to quantify the influence of fault. Fault line selection and ground fault location can be accurately measured by calculating and comparing the regional fault state value of each region. The scheme proposed in this paper applies to a variety of the small current grounding system. The effectiveness and reliability of this scheme have been amply demonstrated through PSCAD/EMTDC simulations and experiments.",0,1,1
"Stock Movement Prediction Based on Bi-typed Hybrid-relational Market Knowledge Graph via Dual Attention Networks
Stock Movement Prediction (SMP) aims at predicting listed companies’ stock future price trend, which is a challenging task due to the volatile nature of financial markets. Recent financial studies show that the momentum spillover effect plays a significant role in stock fluctuation. However, previous studies typically only learn the simple connection information among related companies, which inevitably fail to model complex relations of listed companies in real financial market. To address this issue, we first construct a more comprehensive Market Knowledge Graph (MKG) which contains bi-typed entities including listed companies and their associated executives, and hybrid-relations including the explicit relations and implicit relations. Afterward, we propose DANSMP, a novel Dual Attention Networks to learn the momentum spillover signals based upon the constructed MKG for stock prediction. The empirical experiments on our constructed datasets against nine SOTA baselines demonstrate that the proposed DANSMP is capable of improving stock prediction with the constructed MKG.",0,1,0

"Dynamic revenue management for online display advertising
In this paper, we propose a dynamic optimisation model to maximise a web publisher's online display advertising revenues. Our model dynamically selects which advertising requests to accept and dynamically delivers the promised advertising impressions to viewers so as to maximise revenue, accounting for uncertainty in advertising requests and website traffic. After characterising the structural properties of our model, we propose a Certainty Equivalent Control heuristic and then show with a real case study that our optimisation-based method outperforms common practices. These results highlight the importance of accounting for the opportunity cost of capacity allocation in advertisement contract negotiation for globally maximising online publishers’ revenues.",0,0,0

"Vision-based Navigation for a Small-scale Quadruped Robot Pegasus-Mini
Quadruped locomotion is currently a vibrant research area, which has reached a level of maturity and performance that enables some of the most advanced real-world applications with autonomous quadruped robots both in academia and industry. Blind robust quadruped locomotion has been pushed forward in control and technology aspects within recent decades. However, in the complicated environment, the capability including terrain perception and path planning is still required. Visual perception is an indispensable ability in legged locomotion for such a demand. This study explores a vision-based navigation method for a small-scale quadruped robot Pegasus-Mini, aiming to propose a method that enables efficient and reliable navigation for the small-scale quadruped locomotion. The visionbased navigation method proposed in this study is applicable in such a small-scale quadruped robot platform in which the computation resources and space are limited. The semantic segmentation based on a CNN model is adopted for the realtime path segmentation in the outdoor environment. The desired traverse trajectory is generated through real-time updating the middle line, which is calculated from the edge position of the segmented path in the images. To enhance the stability of the path planning directly based on the semantic segmentation method, a trajectory compensation method is supplemented considering the temporal information to revise the untrustworthy planned path. Experiments of semantic segmentation and navigation in a garden scene are demonstrated to verify the effectiveness of the proposed method.",0,1,1
"Marketing without Consent: Consumer Choice and Costs, Privacy, and Public Policy
Most of the privacy debate pertains to personal information being collected and disseminated in databases without consumer consent or perhaps even knowledge. The author asserts that a more important issue is how these databases are used to impose marketing costs on consumers without their consent. All marketers realize it is costly to communicate to potential consumers, but they often forget that consumers bear some marketing communications costs as well. The author suggests that economic efficiency would be enhanced by requiring marketers to internalize at least some of the consumer costs, particularly those likely to be borne involuntarily. Current regulations address only some costs for some media and often limit rather than enhance consumer choice. The author presents new public policy recommendations to improve efficiency and consumer choice.",0,1,0

"A Systematic Review of Productivity Factors in Software Development
Analysing and improving productivity has been one of the main goals of software engineering research since its beginnings. A plethora of studies has been conducted on various factors that resulted in several models for analysis and prediction of productivity. However, productivity is still an issue in current software development and not all factors and their relationships are known. This paper reviews the large body of available literature in order to distill a list of the main factors influencing productivity investigated so far. The measure for importance here is the number of articles a factor is mentioned in. Special consideration is given to soft or human-related factors in software engineering that are often not analysed with equal detail as more technical factors. The resulting list can be used to guide further analysis and as basis for building productivity models.",0,1,0
"A new hybrid passive/active noise absorption system
A new hybrid passive–active system is developed for sound absorption over a wide frequency range. The system is comprised of a layer of absorbing material positioned at a distance from an active wall, leaving an air space. The motion of the active wall is based on a new control approach which consists of the minimization of the reflected wave within the airspace which modifies the layer’s back surface impedance so as to match the characteristic impedance of air. This technique is referred here as inducing an impedance-matching condition. Both numerical and experimental results of such a system are presented for normally incident planar waves. The hybrid passive–active system results in a high absorption coefficient of 0.8–1.0 over the frequency range 100–2000 Hz and is insensitive to system parameters such as air space depth and absorbing layer thickness.",0,1,1
"Analysis and Mitigation of Power Quality Issues in Distributed Generation Systems Using Custom Power Devices
This paper discusses the power quality issues for distributed generation systems based on renewable energy sources, such as solar and wind energy. A thorough discussion about the power quality issues is conducted here. This paper starts with the power quality issues, followed by discussions of basic standards. A comprehensive study of power quality in power systems, including the systems with dc and renewable sources is done in this paper. Power quality monitoring techniques and possible solutions of the power quality issues for the power systems are elaborately studied. Then, we analyze the methods of mitigation of these problems using custom power devices, such as D-STATCOM, UPQC, UPS, TVSS, DVR, etc., for micro grid systems. For renewable energy systems, STATCOM can be a potential choice due to its several advantages, whereas spinning reserve can enhance the power quality in traditional systems. At Last, we study the power quality in dc systems. Simpler arrangement and higher reliability are two main advantages of the dc systems though it faces other power quality issues, such as instability and poor detection of faults.",0,1,1
"Challenging an experimental nonlinear modal analysis method with a new strongly friction-damped structure
Abstract In this work, we show that a recently proposed method for experimental nonlinear modal analysis based on the extended periodic motion concept is well suited to extract modal properties for strongly nonlinear systems (i.e. in the presence of large frequency shifts, high and nonlinear damping, changes of the mode shape, and higher harmonics). To this end, we design a new test rig that exhibits a large extent of friction-induced damping (modal damping ratio up to 15%) and frequency shift by 36% (considered the first bending mode). The specimen, called RubBeR, is a cantilevered beam under the influence of dry friction, ranging from full stick to mainly sliding. With the specimen's design, the measurements are well repeatable for a system subjected to dry frictional force. Then, we apply the method to the specimen and show that single-point excitation is sufficient to track the modal properties even though the deflection shape changes with amplitude. Computed frequency responses using a single nonlinear-modal oscillator with the identified modal properties agree well with measured reference curves of different excitation levels, indicating the modal properties' significance and accuracy.",0,0,1
"Demystifying the Draft EU Artificial Intelligence Act — Analysing the good, the bad, and the unclear elements of the proposed approach
In April 2021, the European Commission proposed a Regulation on Artificial Intelligence, known as the AI Act. We present an overview of the Act and analyse its implications, drawing on scholarship ranging from the study of contemporary AI practices to the structure of EU product safety regimes over the last four decades. Aspects of the AI Act, such as different rules for different risk-levels of AI, make sense. But we also find that some provisions of the Draft AI Act have surprising legal implications, whilst others may be largely ineffective at achieving their stated goals. Several overarching aspects, including the enforcement regime and the risks of maximum harmonisation pre-empting legitimate national AI policy, engender significant concern. These issues should be addressed as a priority in the legislative process.",0,1,0

"Revisiting Few-sample BERT Fine-tuning
We study the problem of few-sample fine-tuning of BERT contextual representations, and identify three sub-optimal choices in current, broadly adopted practices. First, we observe that the omission of the gradient bias correction in the BERTAdam optimizer results in fine-tuning instability. We also find that parts of the BERT network provide a detrimental starting point for fine-tuning, and simply re-initializing these layers speeds up learning and improves performance. Finally, we study the effect of training time, and observe that commonly used recipes often do not allocate sufficient time for training. In light of these findings, we re-visit recently proposed methods to improve few-sample fine-tuning with BERT and re-evaluate their effectiveness. Generally, we observe a decrease in their relative impact when modifying the fine-tuning process based on our findings.",0,0,0
"A Multidirectional LSTM Model for Predicting the Stability of a Smart Grid
The grid denotes the electric grid which consists of communication lines, control stations, transformers, and distributors that aids in supplying power from the electrical plant to the consumers. Presently, the electric grid constitutes humongous power production units which generates millions of megawatts of power distributed across several demographic regions. There is a dire need to efficiently manage this power supplied to the various consumer domains such as industries, smart cities, household and organizations. In this regard, a smart grid with intelligent systems is being deployed to cater the dynamic power requirements. A smart grid system follows the Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS) model, in which Information Technology (IT) infrastructure is integrated with physical systems. In the scenario of the smart grid embedded with CPS, the Machine Learning (ML) module is the IT aspect and the power dissipation units are the physical entities. In this research, a novel Multidirectional Long Short-Term Memory (MLSTM) technique is being proposed to predict the stability of the smart grid network. The results obtained are evaluated against other popular Deep Learning approaches such as Gated Recurrent Units (GRU), traditional LSTM and Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN). The experimental results prove that the MLSTM approach outperforms the other ML approaches.",0,0,1
"A Dynamical System Approach to Motion and Force Generation in Contact Tasks
Many tasks require the robot to enter in contact with surfaces, be it to take support, to polish or to grasp an object. It is crucial that the robot controls forces both upon making contact and while in contact. While many solutions exist to control for contact, none offer the required robustness to adapt to real-world uncertainties, such as sudden displacement of the object prior and once in contact. To adapt to such disturbances require to re-plan on the fly both the trajectory and the force. Dynamical systems (DS) offer a framework for instant re-planning of trajectories. They are however limited to control of motions. We extend this framework here to enable generating contact forces and trajectories through DS. The framework allows also to modulate the impedance so as to show rigidity to maintain contact, and compliance to ensure safe interaction with humans. We validate the approach in single and dual arm setting using KUKA LWR 4+ robotic arms. We show that the approach allows 1) to make smooth contact while applying large forces, 2) to maintain desired contact force when scanning non-linear surfaces, even when the surface is moved, and 3) to grasp and lift smoothly an object in the air, and to re-balance forces on the fly to maintain the grasp even when subjected to strong external disturbances.",0,1,1

"Towards Designing Computer Vision-based Explainable-AI Solution: A Use Case of Livestock Mart Industry
The objective of an online Mart is to match buyers and sellers, to weigh animals and to oversee their sale. A reliable pricing method can be developed by ML models that can read through historical sales data. However, when AI models suggest or recommend a price, that in itself does not reveal too much (i.e., it acts like a black box) about the qualities and the abilities of an animal. An interested buyer would like to know more about the salient features of an animal before making the right choice based on his requirements. A model capable of explaining the different factors that impact the price point is essential for the needs of the market. It can also inspire confidence in buyers and sellers about the price point offered. To achieve these objectives, we have been working with the team at MartEye, a startup based in Portershed in Galway City, Ireland. Through this paper, we report our work-in-progress research towards building a smart video analytic platform, leveraging Explainable AI techniques.",0,1,0
"Real-Time Neural Network-Based Gait Phase Estimation Using a Robotic Hip Exoskeleton
Lower limb exoskeletons provide assistance during the gait cycle using a state variable, one in particular is gait phase. This is crucial for the exoskeleton controller to provide the user accurate assistance. Conventional methods often utilize an event marker to estimate gait phase by computing the average stride time. However, this strategy has limitations in adapting to dynamic speeds. We developed a sensor fusion-based neural network model to estimate the gait phase in real-time that can adapt to dynamic speeds ranging from 0.6 to 1.1 m/s. Ten able-bodied subjects walked with an exoskeleton using our estimator and were provided with corresponding torque assistance. Our best performing model had RMSE below 29 ms and 4% for real-time estimation and torque generation, respectively, reducing the estimation error by 36.0% ( ${p} < 0.01$ ) and torque error by 40.9% ( ${p} < 0.001$ ) compared to conventional methods. Our results indicate that creating a general user-independent model and additionally training on user-specific data outperforms the user-specific model and user-independent model. Our study validates the feasibility of using a sensor fusion-based machine learning model to accurately estimate the user’s gait phase and improve the controllability of a lower limb exoskeleton.",0,1,1
"Approaches towards business process management adoption under different organizational cultures : doctoral dissertation
This study reviews the main research findings on BPM adoption in connection to organizational culture, specifically the different types of organizational culture defined by Cameron and Quinn (2006). The findings show there are only a handful of papers that discuss the relationship between the different organizational culture types and BPM adoption. These papers suggest there are significant differences in how different culture types impact the adoption of BPM. However, this topic is still under-researched. There is a gap in the empirical literature directly examining the correlation between culture types and process performance. In addition, the literature does not address the approach to BPM adoption under different culture types, although the importance of a fit between BPM and organizational culture is well recognised. Based on the structured literature review, a framework is proposed that shows the relationship between organizational culture, the approach to BPM adoption, and the success of BPM adoption. The framework can serve as a starting point for structuring future research on this topic, which is necessary to gain a better understanding of the relationship between the different organizational culture types and BPM adoption. Ultimately, these findings could help improve the success rate of BPM projects in practice.",0,0,0
"A new accident model for engineering safer systems
New technology is making fundamental changes in the etiology of accidents and is creating a need for changes in the explanatory mechanisms used. We need better and less subjective understanding of why accidents occur and how to prevent future ones. The most effective models will go beyond assigning blame and instead help engineers to learn as much as possible about all the factors involved, including those related to social and organizational structures. This paper presents a new accident model founded on basic systems theory concepts. The use of such a model provides a theoretical foundation for the introduction of unique new types of accident analysis, hazard analysis, accident prevention strategies including new approaches to designing for safety, risk assessment techniques, and approaches to designing performance monitoring and safety metrics.",0,0,0
"A vibrating beam MEMS accelerometer for gravity and seismic measurements
This paper introduces a differential vibrating beam MEMS accelerometer demonstrating excellent long-term stability for applications in gravimetry and seismology. The MEMS gravimeter module demonstrates an output Allan deviation of 9 μGal for a 1000 s integration time, a noise floor of 100 μGal/√Hz, and measurement over the full ±1 g dynamic range (1 g = 9.81 ms −2 ). The sensitivity of the device is demonstrated through the tracking of Earth tides and recording of ground motion corresponding to a number of teleseismic events over several months. These results demonstrate that vibrating beam MEMS accelerometers can be employed for measurements requiring high levels of stability and resolution with wider implications for precision measurement employing other resonant-output MEMS devices such as gyroscopes and magnetometers.",0,0,1
"Adaptive Observation-Based Efficient Reinforcement Learning for Uncertain Systems
This article develops an adaptive observation-based efficient reinforcement learning (RL) approach for systems with uncertain drift dynamics. A novel concurrent learning adaptive extended observer (CL-AEO) is first designed to jointly estimate the system state and parameter. This observer has a two-time-scale structure and does not require any additional numerical techniques to calculate the state derivative information. The idea of concurrent learning (CL) is leveraged to use the recorded data, which leads to a relaxed verifiable excitation condition for the convergence of parameter estimation. Based on the estimated state and parameter provided by the CL-AEO, a simulation of experience-based RL scheme is developed to online approximate the optimal control policy. Rigorous theoretical analysis is given to show that the practical convergence of the system state to the origin and the developed policy to the ideal optimal policy can be achieved without the persistence of excitation (PE) condition. Finally, the effectiveness and superiority of the developed methodology are demonstrated via comparative simulations.",1,1,1
"Software Product Quality in DevOps Contexts: A Systematic Literature Review
DevOps is a change in the organizational culture that aims to reduce the gap between development and operation teams, accelerating the software release process. However, little is known about the impact of this approach on software product quality. This study aims to analyze the influence of the application of DevOps on software product quality; therefore, a systematic literature review was conducted. Thirty-one articles related to DevOps and its influence on product quality were identified. The studies indicate a strong influence of some product quality characteristics, specifically: Reliability and Maintainability. Additionally, practices associated with DevOps, such as the minimum viable product, deployment automation, test automation, cloud computing and team cooperation, show a relationship with the improvement in software product quality, however, its adoption also brings new challenges to preserve security.",0,0,0
"Multi-Commodity Multi-Facility Network Design
We consider multi-commodity network design models, where capacity can be added to the edges of the network using multiples of facilities that may have different capacities. This class of mixed-integer optimization models appear frequently in telecommunication network capacity expansion problems, train scheduling with multiple locomotive options, supply chain and service network design problems. Valid inequalities used as cutting planes in branch-and-bound algorithms have been instrumental in solving their large scale instances. We review the progress that has been done in polyhedral investigations in this area by emphasizing three fundemantal techniques. These are the metric inequalities for projecting out continuous flow variables, mixedinteger rounding from appropriate base relaxations, and shrinking the network to a small k-node graph. The basic inequalities derived from arc-set, cut-set and partition relaxations of the network are also extensively utilized with certain modifications in robust and survivable network design problems.",0,0,0
"Bit Error Probability of Spatial Modulation (SM–) MIMO over Generalized Fading Channels
—In this paper, we study the performance of Spatial Modulation (SM–) Multiple–Input–Multiple–Output (MIMO) wireless systems over generic fading channels. More precisely, a comprehensive analytical framework to compute the Average Bit Error Probability (ABEP) is introduced, which can be used for any MIMO setups, for arbitrary correlated fading channels, and for generic modulation schemes. It is shown that, when compared to state–of–the–art literature, our framework: i) has more general applicability over generalized fading channels; ii) is, in general, more accurate as it exploits an improved union–bound method; and, iii) more importantly, clearly highlights interesting fundamental trends about the performance of SM, which are difﬁcult to capture with available frameworks. For example, by focusing on the canonical reference scenario with independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.) Rayleigh fading, we introduce very simple formulas which yield insightful design information on the optimal modulation scheme to be used for the signal– constellation diagram, as well as highlight the different role played by the bit mapping on the signal– and spatial–constellation diagrams. Numerical results show that, for many MIMO setups, SM with Phase Shift Keying (PSK) modulation outperforms SM with Quadrature Amplitude Modulation (QAM), which is a result never reported in the literature. Also, by exploiting asymptotic analysis, closed–form formulas of the performance gain of SM over other single–antenna transmission technologies are provided. Numerical results show that SM can outperform many single–antenna systems, and that for any transmission rate there is an optimal allocation of the information bits onto spatial– and signal–constellation diagrams. Furthermore, by focusing on the Nakagami– m fading scenario with generically correlated fading, we show that the fading severity plays a very important role in determining the diversity gain of SM. In particular, the performance gain over single–antenna systems increases for fading channels less severe than Rayleigh fading, while it gets smaller for more severe fading channels. Also, it is shown that the impact of fading correlation at the transmitter is reduced for less severe fading. Finally, analytical frameworks and claims are substantiated through extensive Monte Carlo simulations.",0,1,0
"Multi-model assessment of heat decarbonisation options in the UK using electricity and hydrogen
Delivering low-carbon heat will require the substitution of natural gas with lowcarbon alternatives such as electricity and hydrogen. The objective of this paper is to develop a method to soft-link two advanced, investment-optimising energy system models, RTN (Resource-Technology Network) and WeSIM (Wholeelectricity System Investment Model), in order to assess cost-efficient heat decarbonisation pathways for the UK while utilising the respective strengths of the two models. The linking procedure included passing on hourly electricity prices from WeSIM as input to RTN, and returning capacities and locations of hydrogen generation and shares of electricity and hydrogen in heat supply from RTN to WeSIM. The outputs demonstrate that soft-linking can improve the quality of the solution, while providing useful insights into the cost-efficient pathways for zero-carbon heating. Quantitative results point to the cost-effectiveness of using a mix of electricity and hydrogen technologies for delivering zero-carbon heat, also demonstrating a high level of interaction between electricity and hydrogen infrastructure in a zero-carbon system. Hydrogen from gas reforming with carbon capture and storage can play a significant role in the medium term, while remaining a cost-efficient option for supplying peak heat demand in the longer term, with the bulk of heat demand being supplied by electric heat pumps.",0,1,1
"Designing with Static Capabilities and Effects: Use, Mention, and Invariants
Capabilities (whether object or reference capabilities) are fundamentally tools to restrict effects. Thus static capabilities (object or reference) and effect systems take different technical machinery to the same core problem of statically restricting or reasoning about effects in programs. Any time two approaches can in principle address the same sets of problems, it becomes important to understand the trade-offs between the approaches, how these trade-offs might interact with the problem at hand. 
Experts who have worked in these areas tend to find the trade-offs somewhat obvious, having considered them in context before. However, this kind of design discussion is often written down only implicitly as comparison between two approaches for a specific program reasoning problem, rather than as a discussion of general trade-offs between general classes of techniques. As a result, it is not uncommon to set out to solve a problem with one technique, only to find the other better-suited. 
We discuss the trade-offs between static capabilities (specifically reference capabilities) and effect systems, articulating the challenges each approach tends to have in isolation, and how these are sometimes mitigated. We also put our discussion in context, by appealing to examples of how these trade-offs were considered in the course of developing prior systems in the area. Along the way, we highlight how seemingly-minor aspects of type systems -- weakening/framing and the mere existence of type contexts -- play a subtle role in the efficacy of these systems.",0,0,0
"Discrete-time implementation and experimental validation of a fractional order PD controller for vibration suppression in airplane wings
Vibrations in airplane wings have a negative impact on the quality and safety of a flight. For this reason, active vibration suppression techniques are of extreme importance. In this paper, a smart beam is used as a simulator for the airplane wings and a fractional order PD controller is designed for active vibration mitigation. To implement the ideal fractional order controller on the smart beam unit, its digital approximation is required. In this paper, a new continuous-to-discrete-time operator is used to obtain the discrete-time approximation of the ideal fractional order PD controller. The efficiency and flexibility, as well as some guidelines for using this new operator, are given. The numerical examples show that high accuracy of approximation is obtained and that the proposed method can be considered as a suitable solution for obtaining the digital approximation of fractional order controllers. The experimental results demonstrate that the designed controller can significantly improve the vibration suppression in smart beams.",0,1,1
"Phase control for a legged microrobot operating at resonance
We present an off-board phase estimator and controller for leg position near the resonance of the Harvard Ambulatory MicroRobot's (HAMR) two degree-of-freedom transmission. This control system is a first step towards leveraging the significant increase in stride length at transmission resonance for faster and more efficient locomotion. We experimentally characterize HAMR's transmission and determine that actuator phase is a sufficient proxy for leg phase across the range of useful operating frequencies (1–120Hz). An estimator is developed to determine actuator phase using off-board position sensors and it converges within a cycle on average. We also fit a nonlinear dynamic model of the transmission to the experimental data, and utilize the model to determine a suitable open-loop resonant leg trajectory and define feed forward control inputs. This resonant (100Hz) trajectory is theoretically 50% more efficient than pre-resonant high speed running trajectories. The controller converges to this trajectory in 0.05 ± 0.02 seconds (5.3 ± 2.4 cycles) in air, and in 0.05 ± 0.01 seconds (4.7 ± 0.6 cycles) under perturbations that approximate ground contact.",0,0,1
"Asynchronous coordination of distributed energy resources with packetized energy management
To enable greater penetration of renewable energy, there is a need to move away from the traditional form of ensuring electric grid reliability through fast-ramping generators and instead consider an active role for flexible and controllable distributed energy resources (DERs), e.g., plug-in electric vehicles (PEVs), thermostatically controlled loads (TCLs), and energy storage systems (ESSs) at the consumer level. However, in order to facilitate consumer acceptance of this type of load coordination, DERs need to be managed in a way that avoids degrading the consumers’ quality of service (QoS), autonomy, and privacy. This work leverages a probabilistic packetized approach to energy delivery that draws inspiration from random access, digital communications. Packetized energy management (PEM) is an asynchronous, bottom-up coordination scheme for DERs that both abides by the constraints of the transmission and distribution grids and does not require explicit knowledge of specific DER’s local states or schedules. We present a novel macro-model that approximates the aggregate behavior of packetized DERs and is suitable for estimation and control of available flexible DERs to closely track a time-varying regulation signal. PEM is then implemented in a transmission/distribution system setting, validated with realistic numerical simulations, and compared against state-of-the-art load coordination schemes from industry.",0,0,1

By utilizing domain knowledge to define the structure of this matrix, fewer parameters need to be estimated and a stable controller can be guaranteed. The algorithm is tested on a custom robotic catheter and convergence is shown both empirically and theoretically.",0,1,1

"On the implementation of a partitioned block frequency domain adaptive filter (PBFDAF) for long acoustic echo cancellation
Abstract The growing demand of communication systems incorporating hands-free audioterminals has multipled the efforts of developing efficient and reduced size acoustic echo cancellers. This work deals with the implementation of a wideband acoustic echo canceller using only a single DSP chip. The complete implementation takes advantage of two interesting features of a partitioned block frequency technique for the filtering operation:its good computational burden, and reduced and user-bounded delay. Essentially, this technique makes a sequential partition of the impulse response in the time domain prior to a frequency domain implementation of the filtering operation. Furthermore, this time segmentation allows to set up individual coefficient updating strategies concerning to different sections of the adaptive canceller, thus avoiding the need of disabling the adaption in the complete filter. The adaptive algorithm is based on the known frequency domain adaptive filter (FDAF) for every section of the filter, but the adaptation step computation procedure differs from other usual ones because it introduces an additional measure of the input spectral uniformity. Finally, a real time prototype is implemented with the help of a commercial floating-point DSP board. It is able to satisfy the needs of any wideband hands-free audioterminal working in reverberant environments with acoustic echoes of length up to 200 ms (≈3000 filter coeffients).",0,1,1

"Novel surgical machining via an impact cutting method based on fracture analysis with a discontinuum bone model
Abstract Cutting (including sawing and drilling) is a common procedure in orthopedics. Although it is widely used, cutting is associated with surgical problems, such as bone breakthrough and necrosis. In this study, the phenomenon of large fractures was analyzed with a discontinuum model of a bone by initially predicting crack propagation. A cutting method utilizing impacts by vibration was then proposed, and experiments were performed. The results indicated that the principal cutting force decreased by more than 80% in each cutting direction. The findings suggest that the method can realize low load, high efficiency, and high accuracy of bone machining.",0,1,1
"Dynamic Pricing and Matching in Ride-Hailing Platforms
Ride-hailing platforms such as Uber, Lyft and DiDi have achieved explosive growth and reshaped urban transportation. The theory and technologies behind these platforms have become one of the most active research topics in the fields of economics, operations research, computer science, and transportation engineering. In particular, advanced matching and dynamic pricing algorithms -- the two key levers in ride-hailing -- have received tremendous attention from the research community and are continuously being designed and implemented at industrial scales by ride-hailing platforms. We provide a review of matching and dynamic pricing techniques in ride-hailing, and show that they are critical for providing an experience with low waiting time for both riders and drivers. Then we link the two levers together by studying a pool-matching mechanism called dynamic waiting that varies rider waiting and walking before dispatch, which is inspired by a recent carpooling product Express Pool from Uber. We show using data from Uber that by jointly optimizing dynamic pricing and dynamic waiting, price variability can be mitigated, while increasing capacity utilization, trip throughput, and welfare. We also highlight several key practical challenges and directions of future research from a practitioner's perspective.",0,0,0

"Nonlinear Model Predictive Control of Robotic Systems with Control Lyapunov Functions
The theoretical unification of Nonlinear Model Predictive Control (NMPC) with Control Lyapunov Functions (CLFs) provides a framework for achieving optimal control performance while ensuring stability guarantees. In this paper we present the first real-time realization of a unified NMPC and CLF controller on a robotic system with limited computational resources. These limitations motivate a set of approaches for efficiently incorporating CLF stability constraints into a general NMPC formulation. We evaluate the performance of the proposed methods compared to baseline CLF and NMPC controllers with a robotic Segway platform both in simulation and on hardware. The addition of a prediction horizon provides a performance advantage over CLF based controllers, which operate optimally point-wise in time. Moreover, the explicitly imposed stability constraints remove the need for difficult cost function and parameter tuning required by NMPC. Therefore the unified controller improves the performance of each isolated controller and simplifies the overall design process.",0,0,1
"The importance of conflict resolution techniques in autonomous agile teams
Today, software companies usually organize their work in teams. Social science research on team development has shown that for a team to reach a productive and autonomous stage, it has to be able to manage internal conflicts and disagreements efficiently. To better facilitate the team development process, we argue that software engineers needs additional training in negotiation skills and conflict resolution. In this position paper, we outline ideas for what aspects to consider in such training. As an example, we argue that a majority of the conflicts originate from team-level factors and that they, therefore, should be managed on the team-level instead of in relation to dyads.",0,0,0
"A novel hybrid MCDM approach for outsourcing vendor selection: A case study for a semiconductor company in Taiwan
Outsourcing manufacturing is a trend in today's global business operations. Vendor selection is an essential factor affecting outsourcing operations performance and has been determined as a multiple criteria decision making (MCDM) problem. The purpose of this paper is to propose a novel hybrid MCDM technique to cope with the complex and interactive vendor evaluation and selection problem which can determine the structural relationships and the interrelationships amongst all the evaluation's dimensions and support the Analytic Network Process (ANP) method to arrange appropriate weightings to each dimension and criterion in the evaluation model by summarizing the opinions of the experts. Finally, the overall performance ranking of all alternatives can be obtained to assist the decision making. Taiwan semiconductor industry is the largest provider in worldwide market. It is vertically disintegrated and outsourcing is a main stream practice. Wafer-testing is a critical manufacturing step in the semiconductor supply chain that distinguishes whether the IC can meet the specifications. Consequently, it's crucial to establish a thorough model for selecting the wafer-testing vendors in order to achieve the success of the outsourcing operation. A case study of a Taiwan semiconductor company in selecting its wafer-testing outsourcing vendor by using the proposed MCDM technique is demonstrated to enhance the decision making quality. The results and proposed solution can be referred to by not only the semiconductor companies, but also other industries so that they can improve the vendor selection process in order to achieve a higher performance and satisfaction level.",0,0,0
"System-level performance and robustness of the grid-forming hybrid angle control
This paper investigates the implementation and application of the multi-variable grid-forming hybrid angle control (HAC) for high-power converters in transmission grids. We explore the system-level performance and robustness of HAC concept in contrast to other grid-forming schemes i.e., powerfrequency droop and matching controls. Our findings suggests that, similar to the ac-based droop control, HAC enhances the small-signal frequency stability in low-inertia power grids, and akin to the dc-based matching control, HAC exhibits robustness when accounting for the practical limits of the converter systems. Thus, HAC combines the aforementioned complementary advantageous. Furthermore, we show how retuning certain control parameters of the grid-forming controls improves the frequency performance. Last, as separate contributions, we introduce an alternative control augmentation that enhances the robustness and provide theoretical guidelines on extending the stability certificates of HAC to multi-converter systems.",1,1,1
"A genetic approach to the quadratic assignment problem
Abstract The quadratic assignment problem (QAP) is a well-known combinatorial optimization problem with a wide variety of practical applications. Although many heuristics and semi-enumerative procedures for QAP have been proposed, no dominant algorithm has emerged. In this paper, we describe a genetic algorithm (GA) approach to QAP. Genetic algorithms are a class of randomized parallel search heuristics which emulate biological natural selection on a population of feasible solutions. We present computational results which show that this GA approach finds solutions competitive with those of the best previously-known heuristics, and argue that genetic algorithms provide a particularly robust method for QAP and its more complex extensions.",0,1,0
"Pavement ME Sensitivity Analysis (Version 2.5.3)
Author(s): Saboori, Ashkan; Harvey, Jon; Lea, Jeremy; Wu, Rongzong; Mateos, Angel | Abstract: The Mechanistic-Empirical Pavement Design Guide (MEPDG) is a comprehensive tool developed in 2002 by the American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials (AASHTO) to analyze and design both flexible and rigid pavements. The models in the MEPDG are implemented in software called Pavement ME, a program calibrated using Long-Term Pavement Performance (LTPP) sections from throughout the United States, including some from California. The MEPDG recommends that nationally calibrated models be validated using local data, and if necessary, recalibrated, which makes sense when considering the climate and materials differences between California and the rest of the nation. The first step in recalibrating Pavement ME is to perform a sensitivity analysis to identify which variables are most important and to look for results that do not match expected performance. The factorial for the sensitivity analysis was designed to identify sensitivity and is not the factorial to be used for the development of design tools. This report presents the results of a sensitivity analysis showing the effects of design input variables controlled by the designer, and those not known to the designer. The sensitivity analysis shows that the overall jointed plain concrete pavements (JPCP) performance prediction by Pavement ME is reasonable. The distresses predicted by Pavement ME did not show any unexpected trends for any of the variables considered in this sensitivity analysis. Over the course of this study, no major issues were identified in running Pavement ME. The next steps are to complete the calibration using California pavement management system data and then to develop the design tool with the calibrated Pavement ME coefficients.",0,1,1
"Managing Appointment Booking Under Customer Choices
Motivated by the increasing use of online appointment booking platforms, we study how to offer appointment slots to customers to maximize the total number of slots booked. We develop two models, nonsequential offering and sequential offering, to capture different types of interactions between customers and the scheduling system. In these two models, the scheduler offers either a single set of appointment slots for the arriving customer to choose from or multiple sets in sequence, respectively. For the nonsequential model, we identify a static randomized policy, which is asymptotically optimal when the system demand and capacity increase simultaneously, and we further show that offering all available slots at all times has a constant factor of two performance guarantee. For the sequential model, we derive a closed form optimal policy for a large class of instances and develop a simple, effective heuristic for those instances without an explicit optimal policy. By comparing these two models, our study generates useful operational insights for improving the current appointment booking processes. In particular, our analysis reveals an interesting equivalence between the sequential offering model and the nonsequential offering model with perfect customer preference information. This equivalence allows us to apply sequential offering in a wide range of interactive scheduling contexts. Our extensive numerical study shows that sequential offering can significantly improve the slot fill rate (6%–8% on average and up to 18% in our testing cases) compared with nonsequential offering. Given the recent and ongoing growth of online and mobile appointment booking platforms, our research findings can be particularly useful to inform user interface design of these booking platforms.

"An optimization approach for existing home seller-buyer matching
Abstract An optimisation approach for the existing home seller–buyer matching problem is proposed for the Chinese real estate market. In this approach, sellers’ reservation and ideal prices, buyers’ offer prices and preference orderings, and broker’s estimated prices on the existing homes are considered. Sellers’ satisfaction degree functions on trade prices are constructed using sellers’ reservation and ideal prices on the existing homes. Buyers’ satisfaction degree functions on trade prices are constructed using buyers’ offer prices and broker’s estimated prices on the existing homes. A trade price is determined based on the seller’s and buyer’s satisfaction degree functions for each potential matching pair. The properties of this trade price are discussed. Buyers’ satisfaction degree functions on preference orderings are also constructed. A buyer’s satisfaction degree on a transaction is obtained by integrating the buyer’s satisfaction degrees on trade prices and on preference orderings. A matching model maximising the weighted sum of the sellers’ and buyers’ satisfaction degrees is built and solved to determine the desirable matching results. An example is presented to illustrate the applicability of the proposed approach. Some criteria are defined and used to measure the performance of the proposed approach.",0,1,0
"Adaptive Critic Nonlinear Robust Control: A Survey
Adaptive dynamic programming (ADP) and reinforcement learning are quite relevant to each other when performing intelligent optimization. They are both regarded as promising methods involving important components of evaluation and improvement, at the background of information technology, such as artificial intelligence, big data, and deep learning. Although great progresses have been achieved and surveyed when addressing nonlinear optimal control problems, the research on robustness of ADP-based control strategies under uncertain environment has not been fully summarized. Hence, this survey reviews the recent main results of adaptive-critic-based robust control design of continuous-time nonlinear systems. The ADP-based nonlinear optimal regulation is reviewed, followed by robust stabilization of nonlinear systems with matched uncertainties, guaranteed cost control design of unmatched plants, and decentralized stabilization of interconnected systems. Additionally, further comprehensive discussions are presented, including event-based robust control design, improvement of the critic learning rule, nonlinear  $ {H_{\infty }}$  control design, and several notes on future perspectives. By applying the ADP-based optimal and robust control methods to a practical power system and an overhead crane plant, two typical examples are provided to verify the effectiveness of theoretical results.

"Elastically-influenced instabilities in Taylor-Couette and other flows with curved streamlines: a review
Viscoelastic instabilities are of fundamental importance to understanding the physics of complex fluids and of practical importance to materials processing and fluid characterization. Significant progress has been made over the past 15 years in understanding instabilities in viscoelastic flows with curved streamlines and is reviewed here. Taylor-Couette flow, torsional flow between a cone and plate, and torsional flow between parallel plates have received special attention due to both the basic significance of these flows and their critical role in rheometry. First, we review the criteria for determining when these flows become unstable due to elasticity in the absence of inertia, and discuss the generalization of these criteria to more complex flows with curved streamlines. Then, focusing on experiments and simulations in the Taylor-Couette problem, we review how thermal sensitivity (i.e., the dependence of fluid viscosity and elasticity on temperature) and inertia affect the stability of viscoelastic flows. Finally, we conclude with some general thoughts on unresolved issues and remaining challenges related to viscoelastic instabilities.",0,0,1
"Learning to Solve AC Optimal Power Flow by Differentiating through Holomorphic Embeddings
Alternating current optimal power flow (AC-OPF) is one of the fundamental problems in power systems operation. AC-OPF is traditionally cast as a constrained optimization problem that seeks optimal generation set points whilst fulfilling a set of non-linear equality constraints -- the power flow equations. With increasing penetration of renewable generation, grid operators need to solve larger problems at shorter intervals. This motivates the research interest in learning OPF solutions with neural networks, which have fast inference time and is potentially scalable to large networks. The main difficulty in solving the AC-OPF problem lies in dealing with this equality constraint that has spurious roots, i.e. there are assignments of voltages that fulfill the power flow equations that however are not physically realizable. This property renders any method relying on projected-gradients brittle because these non-physical roots can act as attractors. In this paper, we show efficient strategies that circumvent this problem by differentiating through the operations of a power flow solver that embeds the power flow equations into a holomorphic function. The resulting learning-based approach is validated experimentally on a 200-bus system and we show that, after training, the learned agent produces optimized power flow solutions reliably and fast. Specifically, we report a 12x increase in speed and a 40% increase in robustness compared to a traditional solver. To the best of our knowledge, this approach constitutes the first learning-based approach that successfully respects the full non-linear AC-OPF equations.",0,0,1

"LQR-Assisted Whole-Body Control of a Wheeled Bipedal Robot With Kinematic Loops
We present a hierarchical whole-body controller leveraging the full rigid body dynamics of the wheeled bipedal robot Ascento. We derive closed-form expressions for the dynamics of its kinematic loops in a way that readily generalizes to more complex systems. The rolling constraint is incorporated using a compact analytic solution based on rotation matrices. The non-minimum phase balancing dynamics are accounted for by including a linear-quadratic regulator as a motion task. Robustness when driving curves is increased by regulating the lean angle as a function of the zero-moment point. The proposed controller is computationally lightweight and significantly extends the rough-terrain capabilities and robustness of the system, as we demonstrate in several experiments.",0,0,1

"RFM ranking - An effective approach to customer segmentation
Abstract The efficient segmentation of customers of an enterprise is categorized into groups of similar behavior based on the RFM (Recency, Frequency and Monetary) values of the customers. The transactional data of a company over is analyzed over a specific period. Segmentation gives a good understanding of the need of the customers and helps in identifying the potential customers of the company. Dividing the customers into segments also increases the revenue of the company. It is believed that retaining the customers is more important than finding new customers. For instance, the company can deploy marketing strategies that are specific to an individual segment to retain the customers. This study initially performs an RFM analysis on the transactional data and then extends to cluster the same using traditional K-means and Fuzzy C- Means algorithms. In this paper, a novel idea for choosing the initial centroids in K- Means is proposed. The results obtained from the methodologies are compared with one another by their iterations, cluster compactness and execution time.",0,0,0

"A Data-Driven Method With Mode Decomposition Mechanism for Remaining Useful Life Prediction of Lithium-Ion Batteries
Lithium-ion batteries offer excellent advantages of high efficiency, small size, and low cost, but their instability and inconformity remain challenging. Sudden failure of batteries may cause serious accidents, endangering the safety of people’s lives and properties. Advanced remaining useful life prediction methods for batteries can effectively avoid those accidents. In this article, we proposed a novel hybrid method with the purpose of enhancing battery remaining useful life prediction precision and robustness. Based on improved complete ensemble empirical mode decomposition with adaptive noise algorithm, utilizing a special-designed interpolation reconstruction mechanism, the battery capacity degradation series was decomposed into a trend subseries and several fluctuation subseries. Weighted least square support vector machine and long short-term memory network are then established to perform prediction for the trend subseries and the fluctuation ones, respectively. A complementary series of experiments is designed to verify the effectiveness of the proposed method. The simulation results represent that the proposed method achieves higher prediction accuracy and robustness over other comparison models. The proposed approach provides a promising and effective alternate for lithium-ion batteries remaining useful life prediction without relying on the cell dynamic process, which is meaningful for cases with limited measurement parameters or limited computational power.",0,0,1
"Automated Fiber Placement Path Planning: A state-of-the-art review
Design and manufacturing of composite structures are driving the next generation innovation cycles for the aerospace, automotive and energy markets. Automated fiber placement (AFP) is quickly becoming the preferred manufacturing method of those structures as it offers manufacturing automation, reduces production cycle times, and decreases human induced errors. One of the major steps towards manufacturing structures with AFP technology is the selection of the optimal layup strategy. This is limited by, not only geometrical and process parameters, but certification allowable and guidelines. This paper outlines a systematic review of the multiple layup strategies practices currently used and/or investigated for the AFP manufacturing process. The optimal layup strategy needs to be selected and verified to obtain laminates with little to no manufacturing defects. Through a methodical description, the different layup strategies found in the literature are described as well as their mathematical implementation. Following, a geometrical benchmark is presented so that new layup strategies can be compared to others based on the same reference. The article can be the foundation for any new layup strategy investigation.",0,0,0

"Research on Unexpected DNS Response from Open DNS Resolvers

 As the backbone of the domain name system (DNS), DNS resolvers are essential to the Internet. Nowadays, the measurement of DNS resolvers, especially open DNS resolvers, has become a research focus. Previous research works show that DNS responses returned from some open DNS resolvers are not expected for clients and the Internet. We call these DNS responses ‘unexpected DNS responses’. Research on unexpected DNS responses is beneficial to the research, usage and management of open DNS resolvers. This paper explores unexpected DNS responses returned from open DNS resolvers in terms of identification and classification to better understand the behaviours of open DNS resolvers. First, an identification method is proposed to identify all kinds of DNS responses from each section of DNS messages. Second, a classification method is proposed to classify unexpected DNS responses by their influences on clients and the Internet. Furthermore, an efficient identification and classification method is proposed to simplify the above process. Among about 9 million responding open DNS resolvers in the experiments on the IPv4 address space, about 40% return unexpected DNS responses. Experimental results show that the proposed methods can identify and classify all kinds of DNS responses returned from open DNS resolvers.",0,1,0

"The Influence of Asset Management on Financial Performance, with Panel Data Analysis
One of the main concerns of the company is the effort to achieve the desired level of profit. That goal can be achieved through good asset management. Good asset management reflects that the company is able to control its financial performance efficiently and effectively. The purpose of this study is to determine the effect of asset management on financial performance. The approach taken to measure asset management is Fixed Asset Turn Over (FATO), while financial performance is measured by profitability using Return on Assets (ROA). This research model looks simple and uses only one independent variable. The selection of the best model is done after testing several other variables, and the more relevant variable to explain the diversity of ROA dependent variables is FATO. This study uses panel data analysis, which consists of six companies in the period 2013-2017. The analytical method used is Panel Data Regression Analysis. Based on the results of hypothesis testing, it is found that the independent variable FATO has a positive and significant effect on ROA. This means that asset management is needed to improve the profitability of the company.",0,0,0
"Networked Sensing with AI-Empowered Environment Estimation: Exploiting Macro-Diversity and Array Gain in Perceptive Mobile Networks
Sensing will be an important service for future wireless networks to assist innovative applications like autonomous driving and environment monitoring. As a speciﬁc type of integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) system, perceptive mobile networks (PMNs) were proposed to add sensing capability to current cellular networks. Different from traditional radar, the cellular structure of PMNs offers multiple perspectives to sense the same target, but the joint processing among distributed sensing nodes (SNs) also causes heavy computation and communication workload over the network. In this paper, we ﬁrst propose a two-stage protocol where communication signals are utilized for environment estimation (EE) and target sensing (TS) in two consecutive time periods, respectively. A networked sensing detector is then derived to exploit the perspectives provided by multiple SNs for sensing the same target. The macro-diversity from multiple SNs and the array gain from multiple receive antennas at each SN are investigated to reveal the beneﬁt of networked sensing. Furthermore, we derive the sufﬁcient condition that one SN’s contribution to networked sensing is positive, based on which a SN selection algorithm is proposed. To reduce the computation and communication workload, we propose a model-driven deep-learning algorithm that utilizes partially-sampled data for EE. Simulation results conﬁrm the beneﬁts of networked sensing and validate the higher efﬁciency of the proposed EE algorithm than existing methods.",0,1,0

"Impact of late payment on Firms' profitability: Empirical evidence from Malaysia
Abstract This paper examines whether late payment (LP) by customers impacts firms' profitability, using a cross-sectional sample of 287 Malaysian public-listed manufacturing firms for the financial year 2007. This is an important issue given that trade credit is commonly seen as a significant short-term financing practice in Asia. However, in Malaysia, trade credit has not been explored, largely due to the unavailability of relevant published data and the reluctance of firms to divulge information regarding their trade credit practices. To overcome this, we suggest a new measure of LP using the Pareto 80:20 rule to take cognisance of local nuances and industry practice, and argue that Pareto Days Overdue is an appropriate measure of LP for Malaysia. We find that 60% of the sampled firms experience LP and LP has a significant inverse effect on their profitability; and those with shorter credit terms and Days Sales Outstanding (DSO) perform better than those with longer credit terms and longer DSO. The paper also discusses implications for policy makers and regulators since the accounting rules related to the disclosure of receivables in Malaysia are converging towards the International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS).",0,1,0
"Effect of Gameplay Uncertainty, Display Type, and Age on Virtual Reality Exergames
Uncertainty is widely acknowledged as an engaging gameplay element but rarely used in exergames. In this research, we explore the role of uncertainty in exergames and introduce three uncertain elements (false-attacks, misses, and critical hits) to an exergame. We conducted a study under two conditions (uncertain and certain), with two display types (virtual reality and large display) and across young and middle-aged adults to measure their effect on game performance, experience, and exertion. Results show that (1) our designed uncertain elements are instrumental in increasing exertion levels; (2) when playing a motion-based first-person perspective exergame, virtual reality can improve performance, while maintaining the same motion sickness level as a large display; and (3) exergames for middle-aged adults should be designed with age-related declines in mind, similar to designing for elderly adults.

"Global sensitivity analysis of frequency band gaps in one-dimensional phononic crystals
Phononic crystals have been widely employed in many engineering fields, which is due to their unique feature of frequency band gaps. For example, their capability to filter out the incoming elastic waves, which include seismic waves, will have a significant impact on the seismic safety of nuclear infrastructure. In order to accurately design the desired frequency band gaps, one must pay attention on how the input parameters and the interaction of the parameters can affect the frequency band gaps. Global sensitivity analysis can decompose the dispersion relationship of the phononic crystals and screen the variance attributed to each of the parameters and the interaction between them. Prior to the application in one-dimensional (1D) phononic crystals, this paper will first review the theory of global sensitivity analysis using variance decomposition (Sobol sensitivity analysis). Afterwards, the sensitivity analysis is applied to study a simple mathematical model with three input variables for better understanding of the concept. Then, the sensitivity analysis is utilized to study the characteristic of the first frequency band gap in 1D phononic crystals with respect to the input parameters. This study reveals the quantified influence of the parameters and their correlation in determining the first frequency band gap. In addition, simple straight-forward design equations based on reduced Sobol functions are proposed to easily estimate the first frequency band gap. Finally, the error associated with the proposed design equations is also addressed.",1,1,1

"Market segmentation and travel choice prediction in Spa hotels through TripAdvisor’s online reviews
Customer segmentation via online reviews and ratings can assist different hotels, including spa hotels, to better inform marketing strategy development and ensure optimal marketing expenditures. However, traditional market segmentation approaches are ineffective in analysing social data on account of size, different dimensions and features of online review data. Machine learning approaches can assist in developing effective hybrid algorithms to overcome data-related complications associated with online reviews. Hence, the objective of this study is to develop a method for spa hotel segmentation and travel choice prediction by applying machine learning approaches. Method evaluation is conducted through a collection of datasets from travelers’ ratings and textual reviews of spa hotels on several features in TripAdvisor. Findings confirm that the proposed hybrid machine learning methods can be implemented as an incremental recommendation agent for spa hotel/resort segmentation through effectively utilizing ‘big data’ procured from online social media contexts.",0,0,0

"Analysis on the Charateristics of Variable Reluctance Resolver Considering Uneven Magnetic Fields

This paper deals with analysis methodology on a VR resolver using cosimulation analysis with RDC tracking algorithm for position-angle detection considering uneven magnetic fields. The eccentricity of the VR resolver, short-circuit conditions of the excitation and output-signal coils, and shape of rotor saliency are considered as sources of uneven magnetic fields in the VR resolver. Two-dimensional FEM is used for the SIN and COS output-signal waveforms, and these waveforms are converted into absolute position angle using RDC algorithm.

"Efficiently, accurately, intelligently dissecting bamboo: characteristic of vascular bundle in Phyllostachys
A comprehensive understanding of vascular bundles is the key to elucidate the excellent intrinsic mechanical properties of bamboo. This research aims to investigate the gradient distribution of fiber volume fraction and the gradient changes in the shape of vascular bundles along the radial axis in Phyllostachys. We constructed a universal transfer-learning-based vascular bundle detection model with high precision of up to 96.97%, which can help to acquire the characteristics of vascular bundles quickly and accurately. The total number of vascular bundles, total fiber sheath area, the length, width and area of fiber sheath of individual vascular bundles within the entire cross-section were counted, and the results showed that these parameters had a strongly positive linear correlation with the outer circumference and wall thickness of bamboo culms, but the fiber volume fraction (around 25.5 %) and the length-to-width ratio of the vascular bundles (around 1.226) were relatively constant. Furthermore, we layered the cross section of bamboo according to the wall thickness finely and counted the characteristics of vascular bundle in each layer. The results showed that the radial distribution of fiber volume fraction decreased exponentially, the radial distribution of the length-to-width ratio of vascular bundle decreased quadratically, the radial distribution of the width of vascular bundle increased linearly. The trends of the gradient change in vascular bundle’s characteristics were found highly consistent among 29 bamboo species in Phyllostachys.

This paper further explores the application of the weighted Simes parallel gatekeeping procedure recommended by Dmitrienko et al. and proposes some modifications to it to better incorporate the interrelationships of different hypotheses in actual clinical trials and to achieve better power performance.

"Effects of fin per inch on heat transfer and pressure drop of an air cooler with circular and hexagonal fins
Operation enhancement in an air cooler (heat exchanger) depends on rate of heat transfer, and pressure drop. In this paper for a given heat duty, study of the effects of FPI (fin per inch) and fin type (circular and hexagonal fins) on two parameters mentioned above is considered in an air cooler in Iran, Arvand petrochemical. A program in EES (Engineering Equations Solver) software moreover, Aspen B-JAC and HTFS+ softwares are used for this purpose to solve governing equations. At first the simulated results obtained from this program is compared to the experimental data for two cases of FPI. The effects of FPI from 3 to 15 over heat transfer (Q) to pressure drop ratio (Q/Δp ratio). This ratio is one of the main parameters in design, rating, and simulation heat exchangers. The results show that heat transfer (Q) and pressure drop increase with increasing FPI (fin per inch) steadily, and the Q/Δp ratio increases to FPI=12 (for circular fins about 47% and for hexagonal fins about 69%) and then decreased gradually to FPI=15 (for circular fins about 5% and for hexagonal fins about 8%), and Q/Δp ratio is maximum at FPI=12. The FPI value selction between 8 and 12 obtained as a result to optimum heat transfer to pressure drop ratio.

"Design and Demonstration of Power Delivery Networks With Effective Resonance Suppression in Double-Sided 3-D Glass Interposer Packages
Ultrathin 3-D glass interposers with throughpackage vias at the same pitch as through-silicon vias (TSVs) have been proposed as a simpler and cheaper alternative to the direct 3-D stacking of logic and memory devices. Such 3-D interposers provide wide-I/O channels for high signal bandwidth (BW) between the logic device on one side of the interposer and memory stack on the other side, without the use of complex TSVs in the logic die. However, this configuration introduces power delivery design challenges due to resonance from: 1) the low-loss property of the glass substrate and 2) the parasitic inductance due to additional length from lateral power delivery path. This paper presents for the first time, the design and demonstration of power delivery networks (PDNs) in 30-μm thin, 3-D double-sided glass interposers, by suppressing the noise from mode resonances. The self-impedance of the 3-D glass interposer PDN was simulated using electromagnetic solvers, including printed-wiring-board and chip-level models. The 3-D PDN was compared with that of the 2-D glass packages having fully populated ball grid array connections. The resonance mechanism for each configuration was studied in detail, and the corresponding PDN loop inductances were evaluated. High impedance peaks in addition to the 2-D PDN were observed at high frequencies (near 7.3 GHz) in the 3-D interposer structure due to the increased inductances from lateral power delivery. This paper proposes and evaluates three important resonance suppression techniques based on: 1) 3-D interposer die configuration; 2) the selection and placement of decoupling capacitors; and 3) 3-D interposer package power and ground stack-up. Two-metal and four-metal layer test vehicles were fabricated on 30and 100-μm thick panel-based glass substrates, respectively, to validate the modeling and analysis of the proposed approach. The PDN test structures were characterized up to 20 GHz for plane resonances and network impedances, with good model-to-hardware correlation. The results in this paper suggest that the ultrathin 3-D interposer PDN structure can be effectively designed to meet the target impedance guidelines for high-BW applications, providing a compelling alternative to 3-D-IC stacking with the TSVs.",0,1,1

We introduce DextrES, a flexible and wearable haptic glove which integrates both kinesthetic and cutaneous feedback in a thin and light form factor (weight is less than 8g). Our approach is based on an electrostatic clutch generating up to 20 N of holding force on each finger by modulating the electrostatic attraction between flexible elastic metal strips to generate an electrically-controlled friction force. We harness the resulting braking force to rapidly render on-demand kinesthetic feedback.

"CFD Simulation of a Solid-Liquid Counter-Current Screw Extractor
Abstract More efficient processes to obtain artemisinin from Artemisia annua leaves via a solid-liquid extraction process are desirable, since artemisinin is increasingly needed as anti-malaria drug. As a substitute for conventional batch extraction technology, continuously operated counter-current processes are highly attractive for that purpose. To get first a better understanding of the hydrodynamics controlling the extraction, a multiphase 3D computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulation model has been developed in the present project. It relies on the Volume of Fluid (VoF) model, leading to a purely Eulerian description of the flow. Using VoF, the distribution of the different phases within the screw extractor can be obtained. When varying the two inlet flow rates, different residence times for the liquid and the solid phases are obtained. This is particularly important, since the residence time is the most important process parameter to adjust. Currently, the predicted residence times for the liquid solvent amount to only one third of the experimentally determined values. However, accurate measurements are difficult, the assessment of residence times is different in the experiments and in the simulations, and the numerical model does not consider mass exchange processes between the phases yet. In spite of this discrepancy, a very good qualitative agreement is obtained, and these first results can be used to support the development of a compartment model, able to capture later both hydrodynamic and mass exchange processes with short computational times.",0,1,1
"Key Management Systems for Smart Grid Advanced Metering Infrastructure: A Survey
Smart grids are evolving as the next generation power systems that transform the traditional ways of functioning of present electrical grids. Advanced metering infrastructure (AMI) is one of the key components in smart grids. An AMI comprises of systems and networks, that are responsible for collecting and analyzing data received from smart meters. In addition, AMI also manages the different applications related with power and services based on the data collected from smart meters. Thus, AMI plays a significant role in the smooth functioning of smart grids. Malicious adversaries have immense opportunities for attacking the AMI, as it is made up of systems that are highly vulnerable to such attacks. Providing security to AMI is necessary as adversaries can cause potential infrastructural damage and privacy threats in smart grid. One of the most effective and challenging topic’s identified, is the key management system (KMS), for sustaining the security concerns in AMI. Therefore, KMS seeks to be a promising research area for future development of AMI. To the best of our knowledge, this survey is the first to highlight the significance of KMS for the security point of view for AMI in smart grids. We believe that we have taken here the needed initiatives that will help understand the importance of key management in AMI security, and strengthen future research works carried out in this area.

LTE is the standard in the mobile network technology tree that previously realized the GSM/EDGE and UMTS/HSPA technologies. LTE is expected to ensure 3GPP's competitive edge over other cellular technologies. As standardization work of LTE is approaching the end line, it's high time to go for efficient radio network planning guideline for LTE. In LTE just like other cellular technologies, initial planning is normally guided by various industries and operators at their own discretion. They aren't likely to open their advancements and findings. As a result, going on with LTE radio network planning perspective is a well-chosen challenge and a certain hot topic in the current research area. In this work, a detailed LTE radio network planning i.e. capacity and coverage analysis has been performed in order to prepare a radio planning guideline considering possible network implementation in the density in Khartoum city.",0,0,0
"ITERATIVE TECHNIQUES FOR BLIND SOURCE SEPARATION USING ONLY FOURTH-ORDER CUMULANTS
""Blind source separation"" is an array processing problem without a priori information (no array manifold). This model can be identified resorting to 4th-order cumulants only via the concept of 4th-order signal subspace (FOSS) which is defined as a matrix space. This idea leads to a ""Blind MUSIC"" approach where identification is achieved by looking for the (approximate) intersections between the FOSS and the manifold of 1D projection matrices. Pratical implementations of these ideas are discussed and illustrated with computer simulations.",0,1,1
"Intention-aware online POMDP planning for autonomous driving in a crowd
This paper presents an intention-aware online planning approach for autonomous driving amid many pedestrians. To drive near pedestrians safely, efficiently, and smoothly, autonomous vehicles must estimate unknown pedestrian intentions and hedge against the uncertainty in intention estimates in order to choose actions that are effective and robust. A key feature of our approach is to use the partially observable Markov decision process (POMDP) for systematic, robust decision making under uncertainty. Although there are concerns about the potentially high computational complexity of POMDP planning, experiments show that our POMDP-based planner runs in near real time, at 3 Hz, on a robot golf cart in a complex, dynamic environment. This indicates that POMDP planning is improving fast in computational efficiency and becoming increasingly practical as a tool for robot planning under uncertainty.",0,1,0
"Taxi management and route control: a systems study and simulation experiment
The structure and behavior of a typical urban taxi system are addressed in this study. It is approached as a complex, first-order feedback system with network queuing structure. A computer simulation model of a characteristic municipal system is proposed and alternative taxi station and routing patterns addressed. An analysis of variance research design is employed to assess model results, and a method for stationing resources and controlling taxi movement is suggested. The simulation model is written in the Simulation Language for Alternative Modeling (SLAM). 1 PROBLEM DESCRIPTION Historically, the taxicab industry has played au important but little recognized role in the provision of public transportation services in urban areas. In many small urban and rural areas, taxicabs have provided the only public transportation services available, and have been an essential service for many community residents without convenient access to an automobile (Kirby, 1981). The form of the taxi service is such that any member of the general public may hire a vehicle and driver to convey the person directly by road from one point to another that is specified by the passenger(s). Taxicabs constitute a form of transportation called psratrsnsit. Kirby et al (1974) define it as “those forms of intraurbau passenger transportation which are available to the public, are distinct from conventional transit (scheduled bus and rail), and can operate over the highway and street system. m It includes those types of transportation in-between the ptivate automobile and conventional mass transit, such as car pools, rental cars, dial-a-ride, jitneys, limousines, and, of cxmrse, taxicabs. Paratransit can be conveniently grouped into three categories: those you hire and drive, those you had or phone, and those for which you make prior arrangements with other tra\’elers. Hail or phone service is often called demand-responsive transportation (DRT) and includes taxicabs and dial-a-ride. In the dial-a-ride problem, customers all a dispatcher or scheduler requesting service. Each customer apecifiti a distinct pickup and delivery point and a desired time for pickup and delivery. Vehicles (usually small busses or vans) are allowed to deviate from their direct route to serve other passengers. This type of system is usually called shared-ride transit (SRT) and is oflen classified as a vehicle routing and scheduling problem. This area has received considerable attention. In a conventional taxicab system, once a vehicle picks up a customer, it proceeds non-stop to the customer’s destination. This is often referred to as exclusive-ride transit (ERT). The operation of an exclusive-ride taxi system is not as easily classified as a scheduling and routing problem. It seems to better be represented as a queuing problem, specifically an M/G/s queuing problem. An MIGIs queuing problem is one in which calls arrive according to a Poisson distribution (M), calls are serviced in accordance with some general service distribution (G), and there are s parallel servers (taxis). Unfortunately, the complexity of the service distribution makes the problem too difficult to address using existing queuing theory unless very restrictive assumptions are made. Even if the service distribution could be derived, exact queuing formulae have not yet been developed for the MIGIs problem. Nonetheless, queuing concepts do provide a useful fi-amework for discussing the problem. A coherent, continuing stream of research that addrwea the opemtion of a taxi fleet apparently does not exist. This is due primarily to the fact that the taxi industry is ao fragmented and private, that it is often t as a viable means of public overlooked by govermnen transit. Thus, little funding for research has been provided, especially when compared with other _tion problems. Only three pieces of reseamh specifically addressing the operation of an exclusive-ride taxi fleet were identi-",0,1,0
"Multiple Access in the Delay-Doppler Domain using OTFS modulation
Orthogonal time frequency space (OTFS) modulation is a recent modulation scheme designed in the delay-Doppler domain. It has been shown to achieve superior performance compared to conventional multicarrier modulation schemes designed in the time-frequency domain. In this paper, we consider OTFS based multiple access (OTFS-MA), where delay-Doppler bins serve as the resource blocks for multiple access. Different delay-Doppler resource blocks (DDRBs) in the delay-Doppler grid are allocated to different users for multiple access. We consider three different DDRB allocation schemes. While Scheme 1 multiplexes the users along the delay axis, Scheme 2 multiplexes them along the Doppler axis. In both these schemes, each user's signal spans the entire time-frequency plane. Scheme 3 allocates the DDRBs in such a way that each user's signal is limited to span only over a subset of the time-frequency plane. We study the performance of OTFS-MA in high mobility environments on the uplink and compare it with those of OFDMA and SC-FDMA. Our results show that OTFS-MA (with maximum-likelihood detection in small dimension systems and with a message passing based detection in large dimension systems) achieves better performance compared to OFDMA and SC-FDMA. We also present the performance of a multiuser channel estimation scheme using pilot symbols placed in the delay-Doppler grid.",1,1,0

"Concept of a stub-loaded reconfigurable reflectarray unit cell
A concept of a stub-loaded varactor-controlled reconfigurable reflectarray unit cell is proposed and investigated. The rationale of the design is based on the impedance transformation characteristics of the stubs which are exploited to achieve the unit cell reconfigurability. In that context, the optimization of the length of the stub loaded with varactors is presented, which provides an enhancement of the frequency agility feature. To satisfy the space requirement of a unit cell, a potential design of the reconfigurable reflectarray unit cell with T-shaped stubs is proposed. Together with a varactor connected at the two edges of the unit cell along one direction, a good performance of reflection coefficient and phase tuning range is achieved in a preliminary analysis. The comparison between T-shaped stubs and straight-line stubs geometries are also reported as a contribution to the unit cell's performance.",0,1,1

This document defines and describes the use of U-turn alternates to
provide local protection for IP unicast and/or LDP traffic in the
event of a single failure, whether link, node or shared risk link
group (SRLG). When a topology change occurs, a router S pre-computes
for each prefix an alternate next-hop that can be used if the primary
next-hop fails. An acceptable alternate can be either a loop-free

"The LCOE Evolution and Grid Parity Analysis of Centralized Solar Photovoltaic: A Case Study of Ningxia, China
Achieving grid parity in 2021 is the goal of China’s photovoltaic development, which is not only on the user side but also on the generation side. Relevant studies indicated that distributed PV has realized grid parity basically in China, while centralized PV, which belongs to the generation side, still has some difficulties in achieving grid parity. Therefore, this paper takes Ningxia Province, which is abundant in solar resources, as the research object and compares LCOE with the traditional coal-fired price to analyze the situation of grid parity of the Pingluo project. It is found that this project cannot reach the goal of grid parity. Then, the future evolution of the local LCOE is analyzed, so as to determine the time of grid parity of Ningxia’s centralized PV power stations. In the calculation of LCOE, the presence and absence of environmental benefits and the general and optimistic forecast of cumulative installed capacity are combined into four scenarios. The results show that the centralized PV in Ningxia cannot achieve grid parity in 2021 under the four scenarios. However, in addition to the scenario that there are no environmental benefits and the cumulative installed capacity is generally forecasted and will reach grid parity of the generation side in 2023, the other three situations can achieve the goal in 2022. Moreover, the LCOE value is the lowest under the scenario of considering environmental benefits and the optimistic forecast of future installed capacity.",0,0,1
"A Tendon-Driven Robot Gripper With Passively Switchable Underactuated Surface and its Physics Simulation Based Parameter Optimization
In this letter, we propose a single-actuator gripper that can lift thin objects lying on a flat surface, in addition to the ability as a standard parallel gripper. The key is a crawler on the fingertip, which is underactuated together with other finger joints and switched with a passive and spring-loaded mechanism. While the idea of crawling finger is not a new one, this letter contributes to realize the crawling without additional motor. The gripper can passively change the mode from the parallel approach mode to the pull-in mode, then finally to the power grasp mode, according to the grasping state. To optimize the highly underactuated system, we take a combination of black-box optimization and physics simulation of the whole grasp process. We show that this simulation-based approach can effectively consider the pre-contact motion, in-hand manipulation, power grasp stability, and even failure mode, which is difficult for the static-equilibrium-analysis-based approaches. In the last part of the letter, we demonstrate that a prototype gripper with the proposed structure and design parameters optimized under the proposed process successfully power-grasped a thin sheet, a softcover book, and a cylinder lying on a flat surface.",0,1,1

"Automatic discovery of failures in business processes using Process Mining techniques
One of the most common and costly problems that organizations are facing is to find the causes of failures in business processes. Failures are often due to missing or unnecessary execution of some process activities; or with how some activities are performed. Currently, there is no automatic technique that helps finding these causes. We propose a novel technique to identify potential causes of failures in business process by extending available Process Mining techniques. Initially, the original event log is filtered in two logs, the former with successful cases and the latter with failed cases. Then, behavioral patterns are extracted from both event logs using the Performance Sequence Diagram Analysis algorithm. Finally, both sets of patterns are compared considering control flow and time perspectives. The differences found represent potential causes of failures in business processes. We tested this technique using several synthetic event logs. Results show the technique is able to successfully find missing or unnecessary activities, and failed behavioral patterns that differ from successful patterns either in the control flow or in the time perspective.",0,0,0

"A Novel Visual Fault Detection and Classification System for Semiconductor Manufacturing Using Stacked Hybrid Convolutional Neural Networks
Automated visual inspection in the semiconductor industry aims to detect and classify manufacturing defects utilizing modern image processing techniques. While an earliest possible detection of defect patterns allows quality control and automation of manufacturing chains, manufacturers benefit from an increased yield and reduced manufacturing costs. Since classical image processing systems are limited in their ability to detect novel defect patterns, and machine learning approaches often involve a tremendous amount of computational effort, this contribution introduces a novel deep neural network-based hybrid approach. Unlike classical deep neural networks, a multi-stage system allows the detection and classification of the finest structures in pixel size within high-resolution imagery. Consisting of stacked hybrid convolutional neural networks (SH-CNN) and inspired by current approaches of visual attention, the realized system draws the focus over the level of detail from its structures to more task-relevant areas of interest. The results of our test environment show that the SH-CNN outperforms current approaches of learning-based automated visual inspection, whereas a distinction depending on the level of detail enables the elimination of defect patterns in earlier stages of the manufacturing process.",0,0,0
"Requirements for Automated Enterprise Architecture Model Maintenance - A Requirements Analysis based on a Literature Review and an Exploratory Survey
Enterprise Architecture Management (EAM) is the practice of modeling the business and IT artifacts in an enterprise and relating them with each other. By documenting these interdependencies between business and the supporting IT, strategic decisions can be made towards a planned and consolidated enterprise architecture that matches the business needs. However, enterprise architecture models can grow very large, thus making the manual creation and maintenance of these models a difficult and time consuming task. From this, we derived the three research questions of this paper: (i) Which related work exists on the maintenance of EA models, and does it refer to automation techniques? (ii) Is EA maintenance automation demanded by practitioners? If yes, (iii) What are the requirements for such an automation method and tool? In this paper we tackle these questions by conducting a literature analysis on EA literature from research and practice. In addition, we present the results of a survey among EA practitioners we conducted to find out current maintenance practices. We then describe a collection of requirements for an automated EA maintenance method and tool, that we derived from the results of the survey, the findings in the literature review and our own experience as EA consultants. Finally, we present several success evaluation criteria for an automated EA maintenance solution.",0,1,0

The numerical simulation results verify that the proposed method is more effective than the traditional PCA method in detecting nonlinear faults. At the same time, the KPCA contribution map can be used to accurately locate the fault sensor, which can provide a reference value for the sensor fault diagnosis of nonlinear systems in the future.",0,1,1
"Efficient seam carving for object removal
This paper introduces a new object removal approach for images based on discontinuous seam carving. Existing seam carving based object removal methods generally are time-consuming and oftentimes cause image distortion or cutting off many more seams than is necessary. In order to solve these limitations, our proposed method only considers the energy of all the pixels outside the target region. Firstly, based on the discontinuous seam carving, we calculate the energy map of both directions, up-down and bottom-up. Then we carve the seam respectively from the upper bound of the target region to up, from the lower bound of the target region to down and the middle part within the region. Experimental results prove that our proposed method outperform others in terms of efficiency and image quality significantly.",0,0,1
"OpenFish: Biomimetic design of a soft robotic fish for high speed locomotion
We present OpenFish: an open source soft robotic fish which is optimized for speed and efficiency.

"Analytical Inverter-Based Distributed Generator Model for Power Flow Analysis
Quantifying the impact of inverter-based distributed generation (DG) sources on power-flow distribution system cases is arduous. Existing distribution system tools predominately model distributed generation sources as either negative PQ loads or as a PV generator and then employed a PV-PQ switching algorithm to mimic Volt/VAR support. These models neglect the unique characteristics of inverter-based distributed generation sources, have scalability and convergence issues, and are ill-suited for increasing solar penetration scenarios. This work proposes an inverter-based DG model accounting for the inverter's topology, sensing position, and control strategies. The model extends recently introduced analytical positive sequence generator models for three-phase studies. The use of circuit-simulation based heuristics help achieve robust convergence. Simulation of the PG&E prototypical feeders using a prototype solver demonstrate the model's accuracy and efficacy.",0,1,1
"Recent innovations in DRAM manufacturing
Recent generations of Dynamic Random Access Memory (DRAM) have seen remarkable changes in both processes and the materials used. In the past five years the industry has gone from the 9x-nm node through the 7x, 6x, and 5x nodes to the 4x node chips starting to come on the market. In retrospect it is little short of amazing that the competing companies have crammed the required ∼25 fF into an ever decreasing amount of floorspace; the cell size of the latest 4x-nm DRAM is ∼0.0137 μm2 – or maybe we should say ∼13,700 nm2. This has been achieved by the adoption of dual-layer capacitors, high-k dielectrics, and raised source/drains, among other techniques. Chipworks, as a supplier of competitive intelligence to the semiconductor and electronics industries, monitors the evolution of chip technologies as they come into commercial production. Chipworks has obtained parts from the leading edge manufacturers, and performed structural and compositional analyses to examine the features and manufacturing processes of the devices. This paper illustrates some of the different structures of DRAM cells seen in the last few years from some of the leading companies in the sector, ranging from the 9x-nm node to the latest 4x-nm product.",0,1,0
"INTERFERENCE AND FADE MITIGATION TECHNIQUES FOR KA AND Q/V BAND SATELLITE COMMUNICATION SYSTEMS
Up to the past few months, geostationary telecommunication satellite systems have kept taking advantage of the satellite natural wide area coverage capability, of their rather rapid deployment and efficient capability to provide a telecommunication infrastructure in areas where the terrestrial ones were deficient or did not exist. In a context where “broadband” was the major, if not the only driving factor for the development of telecommunication infrastructures, satellites have imposed themselves as natural carriers for broadcast services while remaining an alternative carrier for point-to-point oriented services. But the situation has changed, and the mid to long term perspectives for geostationary satellites are challenged by their capability to remain competitive, in terms of capacity versus cost and supported services, with regards to the evolution of existing terrestrial technology and the emergence of new ones. For the satellite to keep playing a major role as a carrier for broadcast/multicast services while offering a competitive complementary telecommunication means for the provision of point to point oriented services, it should offer wide capacity, good availability, high flexibility, and guarantee the required quality of service in a cost efficient way.",0,0,0
"Dynamics and Control of Global Instabilities in Open-Flows: A Linearized Approach
This review article addresses the dynamics and control of low-frequency unsteadiness, as observed in some aerodynamic applications. It presents a coherent and rigorous linearized approach, which enables both to describe the dynamics of commonly encountered open-flows and to design open-loop and closed-loop control strategies, in view of suppressing or delaying instabilities. The approach is global in the sense that both cross-stream and streamwise directions are discretized in the evolution operator. New light will therefore be shed on the streamwise properties of open-flows. In the case of oscillator flows, the unsteadiness is due to the existence of unstable global modes, i.e., unstable eigenfunctions of the linearized Navier-Stokes operator. The influence of nonlinearities on the dynamics is studied by deriving nonlinear amplitude equations, which accurately describe the dynamics of the flow in the vicinity of the bifurcation threshold. These equations also enable us to analyze the mean flow induced by the nonlinearities as well as the stability properties of this flow. The open-loop control of unsteadiness is then studied by a sensitivity analysis of the eigenvalues with respect to base-flow modifications. With this approach, we manage to a priori identify regions of the flow where a small control cylinder suppresses unsteadiness. Then, a closed-loop control approach was implemented for the case of an unstable open-cavity flow. We have combined model reduction techniques and optimal control theory to stabilize the unstable eigenvalues. Various reduced-order-models based on global modes, proper orthogonal decomposition modes, and balanced modes were tested and evaluated according to their ability to reproduce the input-output behavior between the actuator and the sensor. Finally, we consider the case of noise-amplifiers, such as boundary-layer flows and jets, which are stable when viewed in a global framework. The importance of the singular value decomposition of the global resolvent will be highlighted in order to understand the frequency selection process in such flows. © 2010 by ASME.",0,1,1
"Complex cepstrum-based decomposition of speech for glottal source estimation
Homomorphic analysis is a well-known method for the separation of non-linearly combined signals. More particularly, the use of complex cepstrum for source-tract deconvolution has been discussed in various articles. However there exists no study which proposes a glottal flow estimation methodology based on cepstrum and reports effective results. In this paper, we show that complex cepstrum can be effectively used for glottal flow estimation by separating the causal and anticausal components of a windowed speech signal as done by the Zeros of the Z-Transform (ZZT) decomposition. Based on exactly the same principles presented for ZZT decomposition, windowing should be applied such that the windowed speech signals exhibit mixed-phase characteristics which conform the speech production model that the anticausal component is mainly due to the glottal flow open phase. The advantage of the complex cepstrum-based approach compared to the ZZT decomposition is its much higher speed. Index Terms: Speech Analysis, Homomorphic Processing, Glottal Source Estimation",0,1,1
"A-DRIVE: Autonomous Deadlock Detection and Recovery at Road Intersections for Connected and Automated Vehicles
Connected and Automated Vehicles (CAVs) are highly expected to improve traffic throughput and safety at road intersections, single-track lanes, and construction zones. However, multiple CAVs can block each other and create a mutual deadlock around these road segments (i) when vehicle systems have a failure, such as a communication failure, control failure, or localization failure and/or (ii) when vehicles use a long shared road segment. In this paper, we present an Autonomous Deadlock Detection and Recovery Protocol at Intersections for Automated Vehicles named A-DRIVE that is a decentralized and time-sensitive technique to improve traffic throughput and shorten worst-case recovery time. To enable the deadlock recovery with automated vehicles and with human-driven vehicles, A-DRIVE includes two components: V2V communication-based A-DRIVE and Local perception-based A-DRIVE. V2V communication-based A-DRIVE is designed for homogeneous traffic environments in which all the vehicles are connected and automated. Local perception-based A-DRIVE is for mixed traffic, where CAVs, non-connected automated vehicles, and human-driven vehicles co-exist and cooperate with one another. Since these two components are not exclusive, CAVs inclusively and seamlessly use them in practice. Finally, our simulation results show that A-DRIVE improves traffic throughput compared to a baseline protocol.",0,1,0

"Trademark Infringement from the Buyer Perspective: Conceptual Analysis and Measurement Implications
Trademarks such as brand names may be the most important assets of many companies, but their value depends on the ability to protect them from infringement. In this research, two key tests of trademark infringement are examined: likelihood of confusion and genericness. On the basis of a conceptual analysis, the author evaluates several alternative measures of trademark confusion and genericness, including both existing and new techniques. These measures are contrasted in two large-scale field studies with about 1500 consumers. The results indicate that estimates of likelihood of confusion and genericness are highly sensitive to the particular method employed, partly because the underlying states of consumer confusion and genericness are fuzzy and not well defined. The author concludes with a discussion of the research implications for (1) our understanding of consumer trademark confusion and genericness, (2) the measurement of trademark infringement, and (3) the use of survey-based measures in public policy and legal disputes.",0,1,0

"Robust Beamforming Techniques for Non-Orthogonal Multiple Access Systems with Bounded Channel Uncertainties
We propose a robust beamforming design for non-orthogonal multiple access-based multiple-input single-output downlink systems. In particular, the robust power minimization problem is studied with imperfect channel state information, where the beamformers are designed by incorporating norm-bounded channel uncertainties to provide the required quality of service at each user. This robust scheme is developed based on the worst-case performance optimization framework. In terms of beamforming vectors, the original robust design is not convex; therefore, the robust beamformers cannot be obtained directly.

The experimental study comprised 3 precast concrete beam-to-column connections developed using steel plates with different parameters of corbel length and one monolithic connection as the control specimen. The behavior of the connection was investigated through the connection moment-rotation responses.

"A Sparse-Based Approach for DOA Estimation and Array Calibration in Uniform Linear Array
This paper aims at achieving a joint estimation of direction-of-arrival (DOA) and array perturbations, such as gain and phase uncertainty, mutual coupling, and sensor location error, which deteriorate the performance of the DOA estimation if not carefully handled. To that end, in this paper, the array perturbations represented by a perturbation matrix as multiplicative noise to the array manifold are then reformulated to facilitate the perturbation compensations. One great finding on the perturbation matrix is that it is a sparse matrix, which contains a lot of zero elements and only few nonzero elements. With this reformulation, the perturbation compensation problems turn into sparse matrix completion problems. Then, by utilizing the sparsity of both the DOAs and perturbation matrix, a joint estimation of DOAs and array perturbations is proposed under a unified optimization framework. In addition, numerical studies are presented to demonstrate the effectiveness of the joint estimation.",0,0,1

Furthermore, quantum circuit of the nearest-neighbor interpolation for NEQR is given.

"Do entrepreneurs always benefit from business failure experience?
Business failure and its effect on entrepreneurial engagement has attracted substantial scholarly attention in entrepreneurship research. We contend that knowledge is lacking on the entrepreneurial learning mechanism and entrepreneurial alertness condition under which business failure experience influences new venture performance. In an empirical examination of 240 entrepreneurs operating in multiple industries in a sub-Saharan African country, we use a longitudinal data set to show that business failure experience does not always influence new venture performance. Rather, business failure experience influences new venture performance when it is channelled through entrepreneurial learning under conditions of increasing levels of entrepreneurial learning and a greater degree of alertness to new business opportunities. We discuss these findings and provide avenues for extending this emerging area of scholarly research.",0,0,0
"P02.91. The effect of a standardized massage application on spinal stiffness in asymptomatic subjects
Methods Asymptomatic subjects were randomized to an experimental group (n=20) that received lumbar spine massage or a control group (n=18) that did not receive massage but read quietly. To standardize massage application in experimental subjects, a mechanical device was used with application pressure determined by the subject’s comfort level. Spinal stiffness was measured at the third lumbar vertebra using a validated indentation device. Preand postmassage stiffness values were compared using a Generalized Linear Model (alpha = 0.05).",0,1,1
"Fault Detection in Belt Conveyor Drive Unit via Multiple Source Data
The fault detection for the belt conveyor drive unit gives a possibility to avoid unexpected breaks in production and to plan the repairs for the most convenient time. Trouble-free operation of the belt conveyor system in an underground mine is one of the most essential requirement in case of production plan realization. In order to maintain the system, several features (energy consumption, output, temperature, vibrations, belt speed etc.) might be monitored. For instance, belt conveyors can be equipped with sensors, which measure the temperature of their transmission and the drive unit electricity consumption. The paper aims to examine the possibility of multivariate data analysis application for fault detection. The authors focused on the extraction of additional information from the relation between the transmission temperature and electrical energy consumption (electric current). Namely, in the first step, the electric current signal is smoothed in order to reduce its high-frequency volatility. Then the relationship between smoothed current signal and the temperature is examined. It was observed that the specifically smoothed current might explain the variation of the temperature. Variability of fitted model parameters may indicate a change in the drive unit condition. The findings are illustrated by analysis of signals acquired on the machine and it covers period before damage occurred till the repair. Finally, model outputs for the three stages have been analyzed: before the damage, during its development and after repair. The obtained results prove that the relationship between current and temperature depends on the condition of the drive system. The outcome confirms that there is a possibility to apply context-based, multiple sources data analysis for fault detection in belt conveyor drive unit.",0,0,1

"Adaptive Observation-Based Efficient Reinforcement Learning for Uncertain Systems
This article develops an adaptive observation-based efficient reinforcement learning (RL) approach for systems with uncertain drift dynamics. A novel concurrent learning adaptive extended observer (CL-AEO) is first designed to jointly estimate the system state and parameter. This observer has a two-time-scale structure and does not require any additional numerical techniques to calculate the state derivative information. The idea of concurrent learning (CL) is leveraged to use the recorded data, which leads to a relaxed verifiable excitation condition for the convergence of parameter estimation. Based on the estimated state and parameter provided by the CL-AEO, a simulation of experience-based RL scheme is developed to online approximate the optimal control policy. Rigorous theoretical analysis is given to show that the practical convergence of the system state to the origin and the developed policy to the ideal optimal policy can be achieved without the persistence of excitation (PE) condition. Finally, the effectiveness and superiority of the developed methodology are demonstrated via comparative simulations.",0,1,1
"A network approach to expertise retrieval based on path similarity and credit allocation
With the increasing availability of online scholarly databases, publication records can be easily extracted and analysed. Researchers can promptly keep abreast of others’ scientific production and, in principle, can select new collaborators and build new research teams. A critical factor one should consider when contemplating new potential collaborations is the possibility of unambiguously defining the expertise of other researchers. While some organisations have established database systems to enable their members to manually produce a profile, maintaining such systems is time-consuming and costly. Therefore, there has been a growing interest in retrieving expertise through automated approaches. Indeed, the identification of researchers’ expertise is of great value in many applications, such as identifying qualified experts to supervise new researchers, assigning manuscripts to reviewers, and forming a qualified team. Here, we propose a network-based approach to the construction of authors’ expertise profiles. Using the MEDLINE corpus as an example, we show that our method can be applied to a number of widely used data sets and outperforms other methods traditionally used for expertise identification.",1,1,0
"Spatial-Based Predictive Control and Geometric Corridor Planning for Adaptive Cruise Control Coupled With Obstacle Avoidance
This paper presents an integrated control approach for autonomous driving comprising a corridor path planner that determines constraints on vehicle position, and a linear time-varying model predictive controller combining path planning and tracking in a road-aligned coordinate frame. The capabilities of the approach are illustrated in obstacle-free curved road-profile tracking, in an application coupling adaptive cruise control (ACC) with obstacle avoidance (OA), and in a typical driving maneuver on highways. The vehicle is modeled as a nonlinear dynamic bicycle model with throttle, brake pedal position, and steering angle as control inputs. Proximity measurements are assumed to be available within a given range field surrounding the vehicle. The proposed general feedback control architecture includes an estimator design for fusion of database information (maps), exteroceptive as well as proprioceptive measurements, a geometric corridor planner based on graph theory for the avoidance of multiple, potentially dynamically moving objects, and a spatial-based predictive controller. Switching rules for transitioning between four different driving modes, i.e., ACC, OA, obstacle-free road tracking (RT), and controlled braking (Brake), are discussed. The proposed method is evaluated on test cases, including curved and highway two-lane road tracks with static as well as moving obstacles.",0,0,1

"Finite Impulse Response Filters for Simplicial Complexes
In this paper, we study linear filters to process signals defined on simplicial complexes, i.e., signals defined on nodes, edges, triangles, etc. of a simplicial complex, thereby generalizing filtering operations for graph signals. We propose a finite impulse response filter based on the Hodge Laplacian, and demonstrate how this filter can be designed to amplify or attenuate certain spectral components of simplicial signals. Specifically, we discuss how, unlike in the case of node signals, the Fourier transform in the context of edge signals can be understood in terms of two orthogonal subspaces corresponding to the gradient-flow signals and curl-flow signals arising from the Hodge decomposition. By assigning different filter coefficients to the associated terms of the Hodge Laplacian, we develop a subspace-varying filter which enables more nuanced control over these signal types. Numerical experiments are conducted to show the potential of simplicial filters for sub-component extraction, denoising and model approximation.",1,1,1
"Analysis and Implementation of an Hourly Billing Mechanism for Demand Response Management
Game theory has proven to be a valuable tool to study strategic electricity consumers enrolled in a demand response (DR) program. Among the different billing mechanisms proposed, the hourly billing model is of special interest as an intuitive and fair mechanism. We focus on this model and answer to several theoretical and practical questions. First, we prove the uniqueness of the consumption profile corresponding to the Nash equilibrium and we analyze its efficiency by providing a bound on the price of anarchy. Next, we address the computational issue of this equilibrium profile by providing results on the convergence rates of two decentralized algorithms to compute the equilibrium: the cycling best response dynamics and a projected gradient descent method. Last, we simulate this DR framework in a stochastic environment where the parameters depend on forecasts. Numerically, we show the relevance of an online DR procedure which reduces the impact of inaccurate forecasts in comparison to a standard offline procedure.",0,0,1

Having grid models of existing power distribution systems can be essential for analysis, research and development of innovative smart grid methods and concepts.

"Sensorless Speed Control of an Induction Motor Drive using Predictive Current and Torque Controllers
This paper presents sensor less speed control of an induction motor drive with predictive current controller and predictive torque control. Both the controllers do not require measurements of the motor speed and motor flux. A closed loop observer system with robustness against parameters variation is used for the control approach. The proposed observer computes the required state variables correctly in wide frequency range. In the system predictive current controller based on the computation of back electromagnetic force by the observer is implemented. In case of motor choke use, the choke parameters are added to predictive current controller algorithm. It is shown that the choke inductance has to be taken into account in predictive controller. The predictive method is based on examining feasible voltage vectors (VVs) in a prescribed cost function. The VV that minimizes the cost function is selected. A novel robust prediction model is presented. The whole proposed control idea makes the system practically insensitive to the changes of motor parameters, even at very low frequency. It is proved that the drive system is applicable to the high dynamic performance and wide range of rotor speed. By using predictive torque control we can control the ripple torque and also speed. The obtained simulation and experimental results confirm the good properties of the proposed speed sensor less induction motor drive. Srujana Dabbeti & K.

"Fluid-structure interaction simulations with a LES filtering approach in solids4Foam
Abstract The goal of this paper is to test solids4Foam, the fluid-structure interaction (FSI) toolbox developed for foam-extend (a branch of OpenFOAM), and assess its flexibility in handling more complex flows. For this purpose, we consider the interaction of an incompressible fluid described by a Leray model with a hyperelastic structure modeled as a Saint Venant-Kirchho material. We focus on a strongly coupled, partitioned fluid-structure interaction (FSI) solver in a finite volume environment, combined with an arbitrary Lagrangian-Eulerian approach to deal with the motion of the fluid domain. For the implementation of the Leray model, which features a nonlinear differential low-pass filter, we adopt a three-step algorithm called Evolve-Filter-Relax.

"Multiscale Kernel Based Residual Convolutional Neural Network for Motor Fault Diagnosis Under Nonstationary Conditions
Motor fault diagnosis is imperative to enhance the reliability and security of industrial systems. However, since motors are often operated under nonstationary conditions, the high complexity of vibration signals raises notable difficulties for fault diagnosis. Therefore, considering the special physical characteristics of motor signals under nonstationary conditions, in this article, we propose a multiscale kernel based residual convolutional neural network (CNN) for motor fault diagnosis. Our contributions mainly fall into two aspects. First, we notice that each motor fault category has various patterns in vibration signals due to the changing operational conditions of the motor. To capture these patterns, a multiscale kernel algorithm is applied in the CNN architecture. Second, since the motor vibration signals are made up of many different components from different transfer paths, they are very complex and variable. To enable the architecture to extract fault features from deep and hierarchical representation spaces, sufficient depth of the network is needed, which will lead to the degradation problem. In the proposed method, residual learning is embedded into the multiscale kernel CNN to avoid performance degradation and build a deeper network. To validate the effectiveness of the proposed networks, a normal motor and five motors with different failures are tested. The results and comparisons with state-of-the-art methods highlight the superiority of the proposed method.",0,0,1
"Development of track-changeable quadruped walking robot TITAN X-design of leg driving mechanism and basic experiment-
We propose track-changeable quadruped walking robot, named “TITAN X”. TITAN X is a new leg-track hybrid mobile robot with a special leg driving system on each leg.

"Millimeter-Wave Cellular Wireless Networks: Potentials and Challenges
Millimeter-wave (mmW) frequencies between 30 and 300 GHz are a new frontier for cellular communication that offers the promise of orders of magnitude greater bandwidths combined with further gains via beamforming and spatial multiplexing from multielement antenna arrays. This paper surveys measurements and capacity studies to assess this technology with a focus on small cell deployments in urban environments. The conclusions are extremely encouraging; measurements in New York City at 28 and 73 GHz demonstrate that, even in an urban canyon environment, significant non-line-of-sight (NLOS) outdoor, street-level coverage is possible up to approximately 200 m from a potential low-power microcell or picocell base station. In addition, based on statistical channel models from these measurements, it is shown that mmW systems can offer more than an order of magnitude increase in capacity over current state-of-the-art 4G cellular networks at current cell densities. Cellular systems, however, will need to be significantly redesigned to fully achieve these gains. Specifically, the requirement of highly directional and adaptive transmissions, directional isolation between links, and significant possibilities of outage have strong implications on multiple access, channel structure, synchronization, and receiver design. To address these challenges, the paper discusses how various technologies including adaptive beamforming, multihop relaying, heterogeneous network architectures, and carrier aggregation can be leveraged in the mmW context.",0,1,0
"Effect of Active and Passive Protective Soft Skins on Collision Forces in Human-robot Collaboration
Soft electronic skins are one of the means to turn a classical industrial manipulator into a collaborative robot. For manipulators that are already ﬁt for physical human-robot collaboration, soft skins can make them even safer. In this work, we study the after impact behavior of two collaborative manipulators (UR10e and KUKA LBR iiwa) and one classical industrial manipulator (KUKA Cybertech), in the presence or absence of an industrial protective skin (AIRSKIN). In addition, we isolate the e ﬀ ects of the passive padding and the active contribution of the sensor to robot reaction. We present a total of 2250 collision measurements and study the impact force, contact duration, clamping force, and impulse. This collected dataset is publicly available. We summarize our results as follows. For transient collisions, the passive skin properties lowered the impact forces by about 40 %. During quasi-static contact, the e ﬀ ect of skin covers—active or passive—cannot be isolated from the collision detection and reaction by the collaborative robots. Important e ﬀ ects of the stop categories triggered by the active protective skin were found. We systematically compare the di ﬀ erent settings and compare the empirically established safe velocities with prescriptions by the ISO / TS 15066. In some cases, up to the quadruple of the ISO / TS 15066 prescribed velocity can comply with the impact force limits and thus be considered safe. We propose an extension of the formulas relating impact force and permissible velocity that take into account the sti ﬀ ness and compressible thickness of the protective cover, leading to better predictions of the collision forces. At the same time, this work emphasizes the need for in situ measurements as all the factors we studied—presence of active / passive skin, safety stop settings, robot collision reaction, impact direction, and, of course, velocity—have e ﬀ ects on the force evolution after impact. impedes",0,0,1
"Motion Planning for Dual-Arm Robot Based on Soft Actor-Critic
In this paper, a motion planning method based on the Soft Actor-Critic (SAC) is designed for a dual-arm robot with two 7-Degree-of-Freedom (7-DOF) arms so that the robot can effectively avoid self-collision and at the same time can avoid the joint limits and singularities of the arm. The left-arm and right-arm of the dual-arm robot each have a neural network to control its position and orientation. Dual-agent training, distributed training structure, and progressive training environment are used to train neural networks. During the training process, the motion of one arm is regarded as the environment of the other arm, and the two agents are trained at the same time. In the input part of the neural network of the proposed method, all parameters come from the angle of each axis and kinematic calculation, no additional sensors are needed, so the method is easier to transplant to different dual-arm robots. With some appropriate neural network inputs and reward functions design, the robot can perform the expected self-collision avoidance and effectively avoid the joint limits and singularities of the arm. Finally, some experiments of the simulation tests in the Gazebo simulator and actual tests in a laboratory-made dual-arm robot are presented to illustrate the proposed SAC-based motion planning method is feasible and practicable in the avoidance of self-collision, joint limits, and singularities.",0,0,1
"Rocking Drones with Intentional Sound Noise on Gyroscopic Sensors
Sensing and actuation systems contain sensors to observe the environment and actuators to influence it. However, these sensors can be tricked by maliciously fabricated physical properties. In this paper, we investigated whether an adversary could incapacitate drones equipped with Micro-Electro-Mechanical Systems (MEMS) gyroscopes using intentional sound noise. While MEMS gyroscopes are known to have resonant frequencies that degrade their accuracy, it is not known whether this property can be exploited maliciously to disrupt the operation of drones. 
 
We first tested 15 kinds of MEMS gyroscopes against sound noise and discovered the resonant frequencies of seven MEMS gyroscopes by scanning the frequencies under 30 kHz using a consumer-grade speaker. The standard deviation of the resonant output from those gyroscopes was dozens of times larger than that of the normal output. After analyzing a target drone's flight control system, we performed real-world experiments and a software simulation to verify the effect of the crafted gyroscope output. Our real-world experiments showed that in all 20 trials, one of two target drones equipped with vulnerable gyroscopes lost control and crashed shortly after we started our attack. A few interesting applications and countermeasures are discussed at the conclusion of this paper.",0,0,1
"An internal reference model–based PRF temperature mapping method with Cramer‐Rao lower bound noise performance analysis
The conventional phase difference method for MR thermometry suffers from disturbances caused by the presence of lipid protons, motion‐induced error, and field drift. A signal model is presented with multi‐echo gradient echo (GRE) sequence using a fat signal as an internal reference to overcome these problems. The internal reference signal model is fit to the water and fat signals by the extended Prony algorithm and the Levenberg‐Marquardt algorithm to estimate the chemical shifts between water and fat which contain temperature information. A noise analysis of the signal model was conducted using the Cramer‐Rao lower bound to evaluate the noise performance of various algorithms, the effects of imaging parameters, and the influence of the water:fat signal ratio in a sample on the temperature estimate. Comparison of the calculated temperature map and thermocouple temperature measurements shows that the maximum temperature estimation error is 0.614°C, with a standard deviation of 0.06°C, confirming the feasibility of this model‐based temperature mapping method. The influence of sample water:fat signal ratio on the accuracy of the temperature estimate is evaluated in a water‐fat mixed phantom experiment with an optimal ratio of approximately 0.66:1.

"Parameter Selection for the Virtual Oscillator Control Applied to Microgrids
Virtual Oscillator Control (VOC) is a promising technique that allows several inverters connected to a microgrid to naturally synchronize, without communication. However, the selection of the VOC parameters often require iterative or optimization procedures that render its practical use not straightforward. In this paper, this problem is overcome with the proposition of a novel methodology for determining the dead-zone type VOC parameters based on the describing function method. The methodology consists of a set of analytical equations that use as input data few basic electrical system parameters from the converter and from the microgrid, namely, the operating voltage and frequency ranges, besides rated power. The proposed set of equations is used to calculate the parameters required to control an inverter in voltage mode.

"A SMART GUIDE TO DUMMY VARIABLES : FOUR APPLICATIONS AND A MACRO
Dummy variables are variables that take the values of only 0 or 1. They may be explanatory or outcome variables; however, the focus of this article is explanatory or independent variable construction and usage. Typically, dummy variables are used in the following applications: time series analysis with seasonality or regime switching; analysis of qualitative data, such as survey responses; categorical representation, and representation of value levels. Target domains may be economic forecasting, bio-medical research, credit scoring, response modeling, and other fields. Dummy variables may serve as inputs in traditional regression methods or new modeling paradigms, such as genetic algorithms, neural networks, or Boolean network models. Coding techniques include ""1-of-N"" and ""thermometer"" encoding. Statistical properties of dummy variables in each of the traditional usage and application contexts are discussed, and a more detailed introduction of a Boolean network model is presented.

"Cell-Level State of Charge Estimation for Battery Packs Under Minimal Sensing
This manuscript presents an algorithm for individual Lithium-ion (Li-ion) battery cell state of charge (SOC) estimation in a large-scale battery pack under minimal sensing, where only pack-level voltage and current are measured. For battery packs consisting of up to thousands of cells in electric vehicle or stationary energy storage applications, it is desirable to estimate individual cell SOCs without cell local measurements in order to reduce sensing costs. Mathematically, pure series connected cells yield dynamics given by ordinary differential equations under classical full voltage sensing. In contrast, parallel–series connected battery packs are evidently more challenging because the dynamics are governed by a nonlinear differential–algebraic equations (DAE) system. The majority of the conventional studies on SOC estimation for battery packs benefit from idealizing the pack as a lumped single cell which ultimately lose track of cell-level conditions and are blind to potential risks of cell-level over-charge and over-discharge. This work explicitly models a battery pack with high fidelity cell-by-cell resolution based on the interconnection of single cell models, and examines the observability of cell-level state with only pack-level measurements. ∗Corresponding author Email address: venkvis@cmu.edu (Venkatasubramanian Viswanathan) Preprint submitted to Elsevier September 20, 2021 ar X iv :2 10 9. 08 33 2v 1 [ ee ss .S Y ] 1 7 Se p 20 21 A DAE-based state observer with linear output error injection is formulated, where the individual cell SOC and current can be reconstructed from minimal number of pack sensing.

"An Introduction to Electrocatalyst Design using Machine Learning for Renewable Energy Storage
Scalable and cost-effective solutions to renewable energy storage are essential to addressing the world's rising energy needs while reducing climate change. As we increase our reliance on renewable energy sources such as wind and solar, which produce intermittent power, storage is needed to transfer power from times of peak generation to peak demand. This may require the storage of power for hours, days, or months. One solution that offers the potential of scaling to nation-sized grids is the conversion of renewable energy to other fuels, such as hydrogen or methane. To be widely adopted, this process requires cost-effective solutions to running electrochemical reactions. An open challenge is finding low-cost electrocatalysts to drive these reactions at high rates. Through the use of quantum mechanical simulations (density functional theory), new catalyst structures can be tested and evaluated. Unfortunately, the high computational cost of these simulations limits the number of structures that may be tested. The use of machine learning may provide a method to efficiently approximate these calculations, leading to new approaches in finding effective electrocatalysts. In this paper, we provide an introduction to the challenges in finding suitable electrocatalysts, how machine learning may be applied to the problem, and the use of the Open Catalyst Project OC20 dataset for model training.",0,0,1
"Autonomous Mobility and Energy Service Management in Future Smart Cities: An Overview
With the rise of transportation electrification, autonomous driving and shared mobility in urban mobility systems, and increasing penetrations of distributed energy resources and autonomous demand-side management techniques in energy systems, tremendous opportunities, as well as challenges, are emerging in the forging of a sustainable and converged urban mobility and energy future. This paper is motivated by these disruptive transformations and gives an overview of managing autonomous mobility and energy services in future smart cities. First, we propose a three-layer architecture for the convergence of future mobility and energy systems. For each layer, we give a brief overview of the disruptive transformations that directly contribute to the rise of autonomous mobility-on-demand (AMoD) systems. Second, we propose the concept of autonomous flexibility-on-demand (AFoD), as an energy service platform built directly on existing infrastructures of AMoD systems. In the vision of AFoD, autonomous electric vehicles provide charging flexibilities as a service on demand in energy systems. Third, we identify four key decisions that, if appropriately coordinated, will create a synergy between AMoD and AFoD. Finally, we discuss key challenges regarding the system-wide coordination between AMoD and AFoD.",0,0,1
"RUTTING ANALYSIS FROM A DIFFERENT PERSPECTIVE
Rutting is a common distress in pavements with asphalt concrete surfaces. For many agencies the magnitude of rutting plays a significant role in their rehabilitation decision process. As a result many different approaches have been taken to address the prediction of rutting and its causes. As more agencies shift to the collection of transverse profiles instead of rutting to provide greater repeatability of the measurements and to avoid debates regarding the appropriate straightedge length, additional analytical possibilities are being identified. One such analytical opportunity explored in the present investigation suggests that the area under the transverse profile can be used to hypothesize the origin of the rutting from within the pavement structure. This in turn allows for greater prediction capabilities when the cause of the distress can be further isolated in this fashion. With the benefit of the numerous transverse profiles collected as part of Long-Term Pavement Performance Program monitoring, investigations have been conducted to sort the test sections into data subsets based on the areas described above. Neural networks were developed to model these data subsets. The models are in turn compared with other previously developed models to evaluate the impact of sorting by areal magnitude on the prediction of rutting.",0,0,1
"Modelling, simulation and experimental validation of wheel and arm locomotion based wall-climbing robot

 This article presents modelling, simulation, and development of a wall-climbing robot based on coupled wheel and arm-type locomotion mechanism.

"Asymptotic Reduction of a Lithium-Ion Pouch Cell Model
A three-dimensional model of a single-layer lithium-ion pouch cell is presented which couples conventional porous electrode theory describing cell electrochemical behaviour with an energy balance describing cell thermal behaviour. Asymptotic analysis of the model is carried out by exploiting the small aspect ratio typical of pouch cell designs. The analysis reveals the scaling that results in a distinguished limit, and highlights the role played by the electrical conductivities of the current collectors. The resulting model comprises a collection of one-dimensional models for the through-cell electrochemical behaviour which are coupled via two-dimensional problems for the Ohmic and thermal behaviour in the planar current collectors. A further limit is identified which reduces the problem to a single volume-averaged through-cell model, greatly reducing the computational complexity. Numerical simulations are presented which illustrate and validate the asymptotic results.",0,1,1

"A data-driven approach to predict the success of bank telemarketing
Abstract We propose a data mining (DM) approach to predict the success of telemarketing calls for selling bank long-term deposits. A Portuguese retail bank was addressed, with data collected from 2008 to 2013, thus including the effects of the recent financial crisis. We analyzed a large set of 150 features related with bank client, product and social-economic attributes. A semi-automatic feature selection was explored in the modeling phase, performed with the data prior to July 2012 and that allowed to select a reduced set of 22 features. We also compared four DM models: logistic regression, decision trees (DTs), neural network (NN) and support vector machine. Using two metrics, area of the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) and area of the LIFT cumulative curve (ALIFT), the four models were tested on an evaluation set, using the most recent data (after July 2012) and a rolling window scheme. The NN presented the best results (AUC = 0.8 and ALIFT = 0.7), allowing to reach 79% of the subscribers by selecting the half better classified clients. Also, two knowledge extraction methods, a sensitivity analysis and a DT, were applied to the NN model and revealed several key attributes (e.g., Euribor rate, direction of the call and bank agent experience). Such knowledge extraction confirmed the obtained model as credible and valuable for telemarketing campaign managers.",0,1,0
"Prediction of aerodynamic flow fields using convolutional neural networks
An approximation model based on convolutional neural networks (CNNs) is proposed for flow field predictions. The CNN is used to predict the velocity and pressure field in unseen flow conditions and geometries given the pixelated shape of the object. In particular, we consider Reynolds Averaged Navier–Stokes (RANS) flow solutions over airfoil shapes as training data. The CNN can automatically detect essential features with minimal human supervision and is shown to effectively estimate the velocity and pressure field orders of magnitude faster than the RANS solver, making it possible to study the impact of the airfoil shape and operating conditions on the aerodynamic forces and the flow field in near-real time. The use of specific convolution operations, parameter sharing, and gradient sharpening are shown to enhance the predictive capabilities of the CNN. We explore the network architecture and its effectiveness in predicting the flow field for different airfoil shapes, angles of attack, and Reynolds numbers.",1,0,1

"A measurement study on multi-path TCP with multiple cellular carriers on high speed rails
Recent advances in high speed rails (HSRs) are propelling the need for acceptable network service in high speed mobility environments. However, previous studies show that the performance of traditional single-path transmission degrades significantly during high speed mobility due to frequent handoff. Multi-path transmission with multiple carriers is a promising way to enhance the performance, because at any time, there is possibly at least one path not suffering a handoff. In this paper, for the first time, we measure multi-path TCP (MPTCP) with two cellular carriers on HSRs with a peak speed of 310km/h. We find a significant difference in handoff time between the two carriers. Moreover, we observe that MPTCP can provide much better performance than TCP in the poorer of the two paths. This indicates that MPTCP's robustness to handoff is much higher than TCP's. However, the efficiency of MPTCP is far from satisfactory. MPTCP performs worse than TCP in the better path most of the time. We find that the low efficiency can be attributed to poor adaptability to frequent handoff by MPTCP's key operations in sub-flow establishment, congestion control and scheduling. Finally, we discuss possible directions for improving MPTCP for such scenarios.",0,1,0

"When Blockchain Meets Smart Grids: A Comprehensive Survey
Recent years havewitnessed an increasing interest in the blockchain technology, andmany blockchainbased applications have been developed to take advantage of its decentralization, transparency, fault tolerance, and strong security. In the field of smart grids, a plethora of proposals have emerged to utilize blockchain for augmenting intelligent energy management, energy trading, security and privacy protection, microgrid management, and energy vehicles. Compared with traditional centralized approaches, blockchain-based solutions are able to exploit the advantages of blockchain to realize better functionality in smart grids. However, the blockchain technology itself has its disadvantages in low processing throughput and weak privacy protection. Therefore, it is of paramount importance to study how to integrate blockchain with smart grids in a more effective way so that the advantages of blockchain can be maximized and its disadvantages can be avoided. This article surveys the state-of-the-art solutions aiming to integrate the emergent blockchain technology with smart grids. The goal of this survey is to discuss the necessity of applying blockchain in different components of smart grids, identify the challenges encountered by current solutions, and highlight the frameworks and techniques used to integrate blockchain with smart grids. We also present thorough comparison studies among blockchain-based solutions for smart grids from different perspectives, with the aim to provide insights on integrating blockchain with smart grids for different smart grid management tasks.

"Issues in the Adoption of the Scaled Agile Framework
Agile methods were originally introduced for small sized, colocated teams. Their successful products immediately brought up the issue of adapting the methods also for large and distributed organizations engaged in projects to build major, complex products. Currently the most popular multi-teams agile method is the Scaled Agile Framework (SAFe) which, however, is subject to criticism: it appears to be quite demanding and expensive in terms of human resource and project management practices. Moreover, SAFe allegedly goes against some of the principles of agility. This research attempts to gather a deeper understanding of the matter first reviewing and analysing the studies published on this topic via a multivocal literature review and then with an extended empirical investigation on the matters that appear most controversial via the direct analysis of the work of 25 respondents from 17 different companies located in eight countries. Thus, the originality of this research is in the systemic assessment of the “level of flexibility” of SAFe, highlighting the challenges of adopting this framework as it relates to decision making, structure, and the technical and managerial competencies of the company. The results show that SAFe can be an effective and adequate approach if the company is ready to invest a significant effort and resources into it both in the form of providing time for SAFe to be properly absorbed and specific training for individuals.",0,1,0
"A cut-and-fold self-sustained compliant oscillator for autonomous actuation of origami-inspired robots
Origami-inspired robots are of particular interest due to their potential for rapid and accessible design and fabrication of elegant designs and complex functionalities through cutting and folding of flexible two-dimensional sheets or even strings, that is, printable manufacturing. Yet, origami robots still require bulky rigid components or electronics for actuation and control to accomplish tasks with reliability, programmability, ability to output substantial force, and durability, restricting their full potential. In this study, we present a printable self-sustained compliant oscillator that generates periodic actuation using only constant electrical power, without discrete components or electronic control hardware. This oscillator is robust (9 out of 10 prototypes worked successfully on the first try), configurable (with tunable periods from 3 to 12 s), powerful (can overcome hydrodynamic resistance to consistently propel a swimmer at ∼1.6 body lengths/min or 3.66 mm/s), and long lasting (∼103 cycles); it enables driving macroscale devices with prescribed autonomous behaviors, for example, locomotion and sequencing. This oscillator is also fully functional underwater and in high magnetic fields. Our analytical model characterizes essential parameters of the oscillation period, enabling programmable design of the oscillator. The printable oscillator can be integrated into origami-inspired systems seamlessly and monolithically, allowing rapid design and prototyping; the resulting integrated devices are lightweight, low cost, compliant, electronic free, and nonmagnetic, enabling practical applications in extreme areas. We demonstrate the functionalities of the oscillator with: (1) autonomous gliding of a printable swimmer, (2) LED flashing, and (3) fluid stirring. This work paves the way for realizing fully printable autonomous robots with high integration of actuation and control.",0,1,1

"Mechanisms and Attributes of Echo Chambers in Social Media
Echo chambers may exclude social media users from being exposed to other opinions, therefore, can cause rampant negative effects. Among abundant evidence are the 2016 and 2020 US presidential elections conspiracy theories and polarization, as well as the COVID-19 disinfodemic. To help better detect echo chambers and mitigate its negative effects, this paper explores the mechanisms and attributes of echo chambers in social media. In particular, we first illustrate four primary mechanisms related to three main factors: human psychology, social networks, and automatic systems. We then depict common attributes of echo chambers with a focus on the diffusion of misinformation, spreading of conspiracy theory, creation of social trends, political polarization, and emotional contagion of users. We illustrate each mechanism and attribute in a multi-perspective of sociology, psychology, and social computing with recent case studies.

"Flood Risks and Impacts: A Case Study of Thailand’s Floods in 2011 and Research Questions for Supply Chain Decision Making
Abstract This paper investigates the impact of floods on the global economy through supply chains, and proposes measures for the related supply chain risk. We examine Thailand’s 2011 flood since it is a notable example of the impact of floods both on industries and the whole economy. The protracted floods affected the primary industrial sectors in Thailand, i.e., the automotive and electronics industries, with a devastating impact on the whole economy. The impact of natural hazards on the global supply chain is increasing. However, the impact on each firm that is exposed is different depending on how well they are prepared and how they respond to the risks. Designing supply chains in a more resilient way will ultimately reduce risks to the economy. Comparing different supply chains and industries’ structure in Thailand, this study identifies the factors in private investment decision- making, such as locations of facilities, alternate locations of production, the diversified sources of procurement, emergent assistance from other partner companies in the same supply chain, and degree of the recovery of customers and proposes a hypothesis and related questions for future research.",0,1,0
"Three dimensional periodic foundations for base seismic isolation
Based on the concept of phononic crystals, periodic foundations made of periodic materials are investigated in this paper. The periodic foundations can provide low frequency band gaps, which cover the main frequency ranges of seismic waves. Therefore, the periodic foundations are able to protect the upper structures during earthquake events. In this paper, the basic theory of three dimensional periodic foundations is studied and the finite element method was used to conduct the sensitivity study. A simplified three-dimensional periodic foundation with a superstructure was tested in the field and the feasibility of three dimensional periodic foundations was proved. The test results showed that the response of the upper structure with the three dimensional periodic foundation was reduced under excitation waves with the main frequency falling in the attenuation zones. The finite element analysis results are consistent with the experimental data, indicating that three dimensional periodic foundations are a feasible way of reducing seismic vibrations.",0,0,1
"The problem of classification of personnel
The personnel classification problem arises in its pure form when all job applicants must be used, being divided among a number of job categories. The use of tests for classification involves problems of two types: (1) problems concerning the design, choice, and weighting of tests into a battery, and (2) problems of establishing the optimum administrative procedure of using test results for assignment. A consideration of the first problem emphasizes the desirability of using simple, factorially pure tests which may be expected to have a wide range of validities for different job categories. In the use of test results for assignment, an initial problem is that of expressing predictions of success in different jobs in comparable score units. These units should take account of predictor validity and of job importance. Procedures are described for handling assignment either in terms of daily quotas or in terms of a stable predicted yield.",0,0,0

"The wicked problem of social cohesion: moving ahead

Purpose
Despite the amount of attention given to social cohesion, divisions within many societies are becoming wider due to various factors including religious and far-right extremism and economic austerity. Given its “wickedness”, social cohesion has been researched from various dimensions. However, to develop an effective solution-based programme, these multi-facets need to be brought together for a clearer way forward. This paper aims to bring together multiple disciplines to propose a way forward in the social cohesion discourse in the following two ways: by developing a common conceptualisation of social cohesion and identifying an effective approach to operationalise social cohesion.


Design/methodology/approach
This research adopted a critical qualitative research approach and used three expert discussion forums consisting of academics and practitioners from multiple disciplines.

"Orientation-point relation based inspection path planning method for 5-axis OMI system
Abstract Inspection path planning methods are of great importance to OMI systems. Most researches only optimize the inspection path length. However, the number of probe orientations (NPOs) also has a great influence on inspection efficiency and accuracy, especially for parts with complicated features. To optimize the NPOs and the path length, this paper firstly proposes the concept of orientation-point (O-P) relation schema which includes all valid O-P inspection cases. Then based on the O-P relation schema, two algorithms – the minimum orientation algorithm (MOA) and the shortest path algorithm (SPA), which consider NPOs and path length in different priorities were proposed. MOA was designed to find the minimum orientations that can measure all the inspection points according to the O-P relation schema, then the inspection points were categorized into groups by the selected orientations. The traveling salesman problem (TSP) algorithm was used to plan the inspection path for each group's points, finally the total path was obtained by connecting paths of different groups in sequence. SPA firstly uses the TSP algorithm to obtain the shortest inspection sequence, then minimizes the NPOs by finding orientations that can inspect most consecutive points along the planned inspection sequence according to the O-P relation schema. To avoid possible collisions during the inspection process, a safe box that contains the inspection part was defined before planning the path, which enables the probe to cross obstacles by moving to the safe planes of the safe box. Simulation experiments were conducted on three parts, the results show that both MOA and SPA can obtain a collision-free inspection path. MOA can effectively decrease the NPOs compared with SPA, and the path length can be even shorter than that of SPA in some complicated cases.",0,0,0

"A Distributed Parameter Electromechanical Model for Cantilevered Piezoelectric Energy Harvesters
Cantilevered beams with piezoceramic layers have been frequently used as piezoelectric vibration energy harvesters in the past five years. The literature includes several single degree-of-freedom models, a few approximate distributed parameter models and even some incorrect approaches for predicting the electromechanical behavior of these harvesters. In this paper, we present the exact analytical solution of a cantilevered piezoelectric energy harvester with Euler–Bernoulli beam assumptions. The excitation of the harvester is assumed to be due to its base motion in the form of translation in the transverse direction with small rotation, and it is not restricted to be harmonic in time. The resulting expressions for the coupled mechanical response and the electrical outputs are then reduced for the particular case of harmonic behavior in time and closed-form exact expressions are obtained. Simple expressions for the coupled mechanical response, voltage, current, and power outputs are also presented for excitations around the modal frequencies. Finally, the model proposed is used in a parametric case study for a unimorph harvester, and important characteristics of the coupled distributed parameter system, such as short circuit and open circuit behaviors, are investigated in detail. Modal electromechanical coupling and dependence of the electrical outputs on the locations of the electrodes are also discussed with examples.",0,0,1
"Collaborative service-component integration in cloud manufacturing
The Industrial Internet technologies are anticipated to enable agile manufacturing processes in response to the growing demand for personalised products/services with shorter lifecycles. This trend has resulted in a gradual transformation of traditional ‘tree-like’ and monolithic systems into complex networks of self-contained and autonomous ‘components’ (a.k.a., Internet of things) and ‘services’ (a.k.a., Internet of services). Cloud Manufacturing is an emerging concept that enables modularisation and service-orientation in the context of manufacturing, in which systematic orchestration, matching, and sharing of services and components are the key. This work develops a framework for dynamic integration of manufacturing services and components in a collaborative network of organisations. The framework dynamically recommends the best matching of services, components and organisations, as well as the best collaboration decisions in terms of sharing (shareable) services and/or components between organisations. The problem is formulated as a bi-objective mixed-integer program, and solved via an efficient socio-inspired tabu search. The objectives of the model are to increase service level and enhance collaboration through maximising service fulfilment and minimising unnecessary sharing of services/components, respectively. Numerical experiments are conducted to demonstrate the benefits of the developed framework for efficient and optimal (re)configuration of collaborative networked organisations, addressing the Industry 4.0 demand for agility through modularisation and service-orientation.",0,1,0

"Robot Transparency and Team Orientation Effects on Human–Robot Teaming
ABSTRACT Human–robot team members often have to interact in a situation when the team members are not physically collocated requiring effective communication to establish and maintain effective human–robot performance. Previous research suggests that characteristics of robot communication can have positive impact on human–robot interaction outcomes such as trust, situation awareness, workload, and performance. In this study, we investigated the joint effects of robot communication transparency (low to high, increasing the amount of information provided through text messages) and team orientation (i.e., robot’s text messages communicating team membership with We statements) properties of messages sent by a ground robot to a human teammate who was responsible for supervisory control. The results showed both benefits and limitations of increased transparency indicating the importance of careful implementation of transparency methods. Team orientation manipulation showed to be ineffective (and potentially detrimental) also indicating that caution needs to be exercised when implementing elements intended to improve group cohesion and team inclusiveness. Limitations and future directions are discussed.",0,0,0
"LOS/NLOS Channel Identification Technology Based on CNN
In the field of indoor positioning, ultra-wideband (UWB) communication technology is the key technology. But the errors caused by non-line of sight (NLOS) communication channels could greatly affect the positioning accuracy. Therefore, identifying the channel type can effectively avoid the above-mentioned errors, thereby helping to reduce the loss of positioning accuracy. This paper proposes a LOS/NLOS channel identification method by using a convolutional neural network (CNN) to identifying the impulse response figures of the channels. This method is capable of identifying four different types of channel impulse response figures and providing excellent identification accuracy. The results show that the accuracy of identifying LOS (0-4m), NLOS (0-4m), NLOS (4-10m) and extreme NLOS channel impulse response figures can reach 98.24%.",0,1,0

This involvesthe modeling of district heating systems, which are frequently connected to DCHP plants, as well as the use of heat storage for balancing between heat and power production. Furthermore,the accumulated effect from increasing number of DCHP plants on the total power production is considered. Methods for calculating dynamic temperatureresponsein districtheating (DH) pipes have been reviewed and analyzed numerically.Furthermore, it has been shown that a tree-structuredDH network consistingof about one thousand pipes can be reduced to a simplechain structureof ten equivalentpipes without loosing much accuracy when temperaturedynamics are calculated.

"A Tendon-Driven Robot Gripper With Passively Switchable Underactuated Surface and its Physics Simulation Based Parameter Optimization
In this letter, we propose a single-actuator gripper that can lift thin objects lying on a flat surface, in addition to the ability as a standard parallel gripper. The key is a crawler on the fingertip, which is underactuated together with other finger joints and switched with a passive and spring-loaded mechanism. While the idea of crawling finger is not a new one, this letter contributes to realize the crawling without additional motor. The gripper can passively change the mode from the parallel approach mode to the pull-in mode, then finally to the power grasp mode, according to the grasping state. To optimize the highly underactuated system, we take a combination of black-box optimization and physics simulation of the whole grasp process. We show that this simulation-based approach can effectively consider the pre-contact motion, in-hand manipulation, power grasp stability, and even failure mode, which is difficult for the static-equilibrium-analysis-based approaches. In the last part of the letter, we demonstrate that a prototype gripper with the proposed structure and design parameters optimized under the proposed process successfully power-grasped a thin sheet, a softcover book, and a cylinder lying on a flat surface.",0,1,1

"State-of-the-Art Review of Positive Energy Building and Community Systems
A positive energy system that produces more renewable energy than its demand while ensuring appropriate comfort levels is an excellent path towards increasing the portion of renewable energy, reducing carbon emission, and increasing the energy system’s overall performance. In particular, it has been believed as step forward towards zero energy systems. Recent progress in positive energy building and community levels is gaining interest among different stakeholders. However, an inadequate understanding of the positive energy system is widely noticed in many projects, and a shortage of standard details on the positive energy system still prevails in the research community. Therefore, a state-of-the-art review of positive energy building and community is conducted in this paper. Firstly, this paper begins with the definitions and concepts of positive energy buildings and communities. Secondly, it comprehensively describes the energy supplies, demands, indicators, storage, energy management, roles of stakeholders, and bottlenecks of positive energy systems. Thirdly, the main differences between positive energy buildings and communities are summarized. Fourthly, the impact of smart energy grids and new energy vehicles on the positive energy buildings and communities is derived. As a conclusion, this paper shows that even though all the energy-efficient buildings such as passive buildings, nearly zero energy buildings, zero energy buildings, positive energy buildings look like an up-trending scale of renewable penetration, considerable differences are visible among all, and the same thing applies to the community level. Furthermore, considerable differences exist when comparing between positive buildings and communities regarding both the technical and economic perspectives.",0,0,1
"VISION SYSTEM FOR PRINTED CIRCUIT BOARD INSPECTION
In this paper we present a Computer Vision system for printed circuit board (PCB) automated inspection. In the last years PCB industry has been invested in manufacturing automation improvement. This is known, especially in measurement and inspection field. We can note that the tolerances on PCB assembly become more accurate. With computer hardware and cameras advances, new Computer Vision algorithms should be developed, and applied in industry with low cost. Besides, new visual inspection systems using computers should be implemented to solve smaller tolerance requirements. A PCB consists in a circuit and electronic components assembled in a surface. There are three main process involved in its manufacture, where the inspection is necessary. The main process consists in the printing itself. Another important procedure is the components placement over the PCB surface. And the third is the components soldering. In the proposed Computer Vision PCB Inspection System we consider the first manufacturing stage, i.e., the board printing. We first compare a PCB standard image with a PCB image, using a simple subtraction algorithm that can highlight the main problem-regions. Then we used connection analysis to find fatal and potential errors, like breaks and circuit shorts. In other to develop this methodology in real PCB, we propose to magnify the problem-regions and start to find the errors in a set of PCB sections, which are smaller than the main PCB image. This approach seems to be very effective if applied in a real time inspection system.

This paper introduces an empirical approach to dispatch resources in real-time power system operation with growing levels of uncertainties emerging from intermittent and distributed energy resources in the supply and the demand side. It is shown that by taking empirical data of specific sizes, the dispatch results can lead to a quantifiable and rigorous bound on the risk of violating constraints at the implementation stage. In particular, we formulate the look-ahead real-time economic dispatch problem using the scenario approach. This approach takes empirical data as input and guarantees a tunable probability of violating the constraints according to the input data size. By exploiting the structure of the economic dispatch, we show that in the absence of transmission constraints, the number of samples that is required by the theory does not grow with the size of the problem. In the more general case with transmission constraints, it is shown that the posterior bound on the risk of dispatch can be quantified and can be much smaller than the risk bound before solving the dispatch. Numerical examples based on a standard test system suggest that the scenario approach can provide a practically attractive solution with theoretically rigorous properties for risk-limiting power system operations.",0,0,1
"A Cost Function-Oriented Quantitative Evaluation Method for Unmanned Ground Vehicles
Task driven approach is widely used as an evaluation method for intelligent vehicle, however this approach may lead to many teams using the conservative approach to complete the task. Although the competition task can be completed, it has deviated from the goal of technological development actually. A cost function-oriented quantitative evaluation method is proposed in this study. The time to complete each task and the quality of each indicator are considered in the evaluation method. The cost function-oriented quantitative evaluation method guides the intelligent vehicle’s development in the ""low-cost index"" (i.e. high technology) direction. The evaluation results in the 2010 Future Challenge: Intelligent Vehicles and Beyond (FC’ 2010) competition showed that the proposed method can quantitatively evaluate the overall technical performance and individual technical performance of unmanned vehicles.",0,0,0
"The NederDrone: A hybrid lift, hybrid energy hydrogen UAV
A lot of UAV applications require vertical take-off and landing (VTOL) combined with very long-range or endurance. Transitioning UAVs have been proposed to combine the VTOL capabilities of helicopters with the efficient long-range flight properties of fixed-wing aircraft. But energy is still a bottleneck for many electric long endurance applications. While solar power technology and battery technology have improved a lot, in rougher conditions they still respectively lack the power or total amount of energy required for many real-world situations. In this paper, we introduce the NederDrone, a hybrid lift, hybrid energy hydrogen-powered UAV which can perform vertical take-off and landings using 12 propellers while flying efficiently in forward flight thanks to its fixed wings. The energy is supplied from a mix of hydrogen-driven fuel-cells to store large amounts of energy and battery power for high power situations. The hydrogen is stored in a pressurized cylinder around which the UAV is optimized. This paper analyses the selection of the concept, the implemented safety elements, the electronics and flight control and shows flight data including a 3h38 flight at sea, starting and landing on a small moving ship.",0,0,1
"Self-Organizing Traffic at a Malfunctioning Intersection
Traffic signals and traffic flow models have been studied extensively in the past and have provided valuable insights on the design of signalling systems, congestion control, and punitive policies. This paper takes a slightly different tack and describes what happens at an intersection where the traffic signals are malfunctioning and stuck in some configuration. By modelling individual vehicles as agents, we were able to replicate the surprisingly organized traffic flow that we observed at a real malfunctioning intersection in urban India. Counter-intuitively, the very lawlessness that normally causes jams was causing traffic to flow smoothly at this intersection. We situate this research in the context of other research on emergent complex phenomena in traffic, and suggest further lines of research that could benefit from the analysis and modelling of rule-breaking behaviour.",0,0,0
"Safety evaluation of connected and automated vehicles in mixed traffic with conventional vehicles at intersections
Abstract Connected and Automated Vehicles (CAVs) can potentially improve the performance of the transportation system by reducing human errors. This paper investigates the safety impact of CAVs in a mixed traffic with conventional vehicles at intersections. Analyzing real-world AV crashes in California revealed that rear-end crashes at intersections are the dominant crash type. Therefore, to enhance our understanding of the future interactions between human-driven vehicles with CAVs at intersections, a simulation framework was developed to model the mixed traffic environment of Automated Vehicles (AV), cooperative AVs, and conventional human-driven vehicles. In order to model AVs driving behavior, Adaptive Cruise Control (ACC) and cooperative ACC (CACC) models are utilized. Particularly, this study explores system improvements due to automation and connectivity across varying CAV market penetration scenarios. ACC and CACC car following models are used to mimic the behavior of AVs and cooperative AVs. Real-world connected vehicle data are utilized to modify and tune the acceleration/deceleration regimes of the Wiedemann model. Next, the driving volatility concept capturing variability in vehicle speeds was utilized to calibrate the simulation to represent the safety performance of a real-world environment. Two surrogate safety measures are used to evaluate the safety performance of a representative intersection under different market penetration rate of CAVs: the number of longitudinal conflicts and driving volatility. At low levels of ACC market penetration, the safety improvements were found to be marginal, but safety improved substantially with more than 40% ACC penetration. Additional safety improvements can be achieved more quickly through the addition of cooperation and connectivity through CACC. Furthermore, ACC/CACC vehicles were found to improve mobility performance in terms of average speed and travel time at intersections.",0,0,1
"An Empirical Study of the Landscape of Open Source Projects in Baidu, Alibaba, and Tencent
Open source software has drawn more and more attention from researchers, developers and companies nowadays. Meanwhile, many Chinese technology companies are embracing open source and choosing to open source their projects. Nevertheless, most previous studies are concentrated on international companies such as Microsoft or Google, while the practical values of open source projects of Chinese technology companies remain unclear. To address this issue, we conduct a mixed-method study to investigate the landscape of projects open sourced by three large Chinese technology companies, namely Baidu, Alibaba, and Tencent (BAT). We study the categories and characteristics of open source projects, the developer's perceptions towards open sourcing effort for these companies, and the internationalization effort of their open source projects. We collected 1,000 open source projects that were open sourced by BAT in GitHub and performed an online survey that received 101 responses from developers of these projects. Some key findings include: 1) BAT prefer to open source frontend development projects, 2) 88% of the respondents are positive towards open sourcing software projects in their respective companies, 3) 64% of the respondents reveal that the most common motivations for BAT to open source their projects are the desire to gain fame, expand their influence and gain recruitment advantage, 4) respondents believe that the most common internationalization effort is ""providing an English version of readme files"", 5) projects with more internationalization effort (i.e., include an English readme file) are more popular. Our findings provide directions for software engineering researchers and provide practical suggestions to software developers and Chinese technology companies.",0,0,0
"Differential evolution algorithm for performance optimization of the micro plasma actuator as a microelectromechanical system
Dielectric Discharge Barrier (DBD) plasma actuators are considered as one of the best active electro-hydrodynamic control devices, and are considered by many contemporary researchers. Here a simple electrostatic model, which is improved by authors, and uses the Maxwell’s and the Navier–Stokes equations, is proposed for massive optimization computations. This model is used to find the optimum solution for application of a dielectric discharge barrier on a curved surface of a DU25 wind turbine blade airfoil, in a range of 5–18 kV applied voltages, and 0.5 to 13 kHz frequency range. Design variables are selected as the dielectric thickness and material, and thickness and length of the electrodes, and the applied voltage and frequency. The aerodynamic performance, i.e. the lift to drag ratio of the wind turbine blade section is considered as the cost function. A differential evolution optimization algorithm is applied and we have simultaneously found the optimized value of both geometrical and operational parameters. Finally the optimized value at each voltage and frequency are sought, and the optimum aerodynamic performance is derived. The physical effect of each design variable on the aerodynamic performance is discussed. A design relation is proposed to recommend an optimum design for wind turbine applications.",0,0,1
"Learning Heuristic Selection with Dynamic Algorithm Configuration
A key challenge in satisficing planning is to use multiple heuristics within one heuristic search. An aggregation of multiple heuristic estimates, for example by taking the maximum, has the disadvantage that bad estimates of a single heuristic can negatively affect the whole search. Since the performance of a heuristic varies from instance to instance, approaches such as algorithm selection can be successfully applied. In addition, alternating between multiple heuristics during the search makes it possible to use all heuristics equally and improve performance. However, all these approaches ignore the internal search dynamics of a planning system, which can help to select the most useful heuristics for the current expansion step. We show that dynamic algorithm configuration can be used for dynamic heuristic selection which takes into account the internal search dynamics of a planning system. Furthermore, we prove that this approach generalizes over existing approaches and that it can exponentially improve the performance of the heuristic search. To learn dynamic heuristic selection, we propose an approach based on reinforcement learning and show empirically that domain-wise learned policies, which take the internal search dynamics of a planning system into account, can exceed existing approaches.",1,1,0

"Dynamics-Based Stereo Visual Inspection Using Multidimensional Modal Analysis
This paper proposes the concept of multidirectional-modal-parameter-based visual inspection with high-frame-rate (HFR) stereo video analysis as a novel active sensing methodology for determining the dynamic properties of a vibrating object. HFR stereo video is used for observing the 3-D vibration distribution of an object under unknown excitations in the audio-frequency range, and the projections of the vibration displacement vectors along multiple directions can be verified using output-only modal analysis that can estimate their modal parameters such as resonant frequencies and mode shapes. Through implementing a fast output-only modal parameter estimation algorithm on a 10000-fps stereo vision platform, we developed a real-time multidirectional-modal-parameter-based visual inspection system; it can measure the 3-D vibration displacement vectors of 30 points on a beam-shaped object from 512 × 96 pixel stereo images at 10000 fps and can determine its resonant frequencies and mode shapes along 72 different directions around its beam axis as its input-invariant modal parameters. To demonstrate the performance of our system in modal-parameter-based visual inspection, the asymmetric dynamic properties, caused by cracks, of several steel beams vibrating at dozens of hertz and having artificial cracks were inspected in real time by determining the modal parameters along 72 directions around their beam axes.",0,0,1
"Learning the aerodynamic design of supercritical airfoils through deep reinforcement learning
The aerodynamic design of modern civil aircraft requires a true sense of intelligence since it requires a good understanding of transonic aerodynamics and sufficient experience. Reinforcement learning is an artificial general intelligence that can learn sophisticated skills by trial-and-error, rather than simply extracting features or making predictions from data. The present paper utilizes a deep reinforcement learning algorithm to learn the policy for reducing the aerodynamic drag of supercritical airfoils. The policy is designed to take actions based on features of the wall Mach number distribution so that the learned policy can be more general. The initial policy for reinforcement learning is pretrained through imitation learning, and the result is compared with randomly generated initial policies. The policy is then trained in environments based on surrogate models, of which the mean drag reduction of 200 airfoils can be effectively improved by reinforcement learning. The policy is also tested by multiple airfoils in different flow conditions using computational fluid dynamics calculations. The results show that the policy is effective in both the training condition and other similar conditions, and the policy can be applied repeatedly to achieve greater drag reduction.",0,1,1
"A low-power MEMS microphone array for wireless acoustic sensors
In this article we present the design of a low-power MEMS microphone array for wireless sensors. The array is used as part of a device that performs acoustic Angle-Of-Arrival (AOA) measurements. The power consumption of this design is lower than that of comparable designs. Each of the 4 analog channels (each with a microphone and amplifier) can be turned on or off (standby) separately. The power consumption is 1.8 mW per channel, and about 0.13 μW in standby. For a single AOA detection cycle (array activation, audio sampling, AOA computation), the energy consumption is 6.02 mJ. When consecutive AOA detections are performed, the energy cost per detection converges to 3.20 mJ. The AOA accuracy corresponds with the expectations. With a mean error of 4°, this is lower than that of comparable designs.",0,0,1

"Logics in fungal mycelium networks
The living mycelium networks are capable of efficient sensorial fusion over very large areas and distributed decision making. The information processing in the mycelium networks is implemented via propagation of electrical and chemical signals en pair with morphological changes in the mycelium structure. These information processing mechanisms are manifested in experimental laboratory findings that show that the mycelium networks exhibit rich dynamics of neuron-like spiking behaviour and a wide range of non-linear electrical properties. On an example of a single real colony of Aspergillus niger, we demonstrate that the non-linear transformation of electrical signals and trains of extracellular voltage spikes can be used to implement logical gates and circuits. The approaches adopted include numerical modelling of excitation propagation on the mycelium network, representation of the mycelium network as a resistive and capacitive network and an experimental laboratory study on mining logical circuits in mycelium bound composites.

"The tubercles on humpback whales' flippers: application of bio-inspired technology.
The humpback whale (Megaptera novaeangliae) is exceptional among the large baleen whales in its ability to undertake aquabatic maneuvers to catch prey. Humpback whales utilize extremely mobile, wing-like flippers for banking and turning. Large rounded tubercles along the leading edge of the flipper are morphological structures that are unique in nature. The tubercles on the leading edge act as passive-flow control devices that improve performance and maneuverability of the flipper. Experimental analysis of finite wing models has demonstrated that the presence of tubercles produces a delay in the angle of attack until stall, thereby increasing maximum lift and decreasing drag. Possible fluid-dynamic mechanisms for improved performance include delay of stall through generation of a vortex and modification of the boundary layer, and increase in effective span by reduction of both spanwise flow and strength of the tip vortex. The tubercles provide a bio-inspired design that has commercial viability for wing-like structures. Control of passive flow has the advantages of eliminating complex, costly, high-maintenance, and heavy control mechanisms, while improving performance for lifting bodies in air and water. The tubercles on the leading edge can be applied to the design of watercraft, aircraft, ventilation fans, and windmills.",0,1,1

"Heterogeneous Ensemble for ESG Ratings Prediction
Over the past years, topics ranging from climate change to human rights have seen increasing importance for investment decisions. Hence, investors (asset managers and asset owners) who wanted to incorporate these issues started to assess companies based on how they handle such topics. For this assessment, investors rely on specialized rating agencies that issue ratings along the environmental, social and governance (ESG) dimensions. Such ratings allow them to make investment decisions in favor of sustainability. However, rating agencies base their analysis on subjective assessment of sustainability reports, not provided by every company. Furthermore, due to human labor involved, rating agencies are currently facing the challenge to scale up the coverage in a timely manner. In order to alleviate these challenges and contribute to the overall goal of supporting sustainability, we propose a heterogeneous ensemble model to predict ESG ratings using fundamental data. This model is based on feedforward neural network, CatBoost and XGBoost ensemble members. Given the public availability of fundamental data, the proposed method would allow cost-efficient and scalable creation of initial ESG ratings (also for companies without sustainability reporting). Using our approach we are able to explain 54% of the variation in ratings (R2) using fundamental data and outperform prior work in this area.",0,1,0

Second, multiple regression analysis indicated that “communicating with their subordinates” and “objective management interviews with their supervisor” predicted the subjects’ autonomous motivation at work, whereas no such relationships were seen for controlled motivation. These results suggest that organizational factors play an important role in the promotion of autonomous motivation among bridge workers in Japan.",0,0,0

"Analysis of Correlation using Fractional Fourier Transform in Images
Image Correlation is widely used in Image processing for finding similarity, locating patterns or some sub image matching. Robust Correlation technique is needed in case the Signal to Noise Ratio (SNR) is not appropriate. Correlation is largely found in spatial domain using Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) due to lower complexity and space requirements. It is either used directly on the samples or some signature features are extracted and then those features are correlated on sample and test sequence / image to reduce space requirements. Fractional Fourier Transform (FrFT) has been used recently to find the intermediatery details of a signal between the time and frequency domains and circumvent noise. In this work, Correlation of Images using FrFT has been found In particular, the Correlation obtained through FFT and FrFT at varied noise levels is compared. Experimental results demonstrate that FrFT is better as compared to FFT, for finding Correlation, by optimizing Fractional Factor (Rotation Angle).

We conducted a study under two conditions (uncertain and certain), with two display types (virtual reality and large display) and across young and middle-aged adults to measure their effect on game performance, experience, and exertion. Results show that (1) our designed uncertain elements are instrumental in increasing exertion levels; (2) when playing a motion-based first-person perspective exergame, virtual reality can improve performance, while maintaining the same motion sickness level as a large display; and (3) exergames for middle-aged adults should be designed with age-related declines in mind, similar to designing for elderly adults. We also framed two design guidelines for exergames that have similar features to the game used in this research.",0,0,1

Conditions under which human drivers find different manoeuvres desirable are learned from naturalistic driving data, eliminating the need for an engineered objective function and incorporation of expert knowledge in form of rules. Motion planning is formulated as a finite-horizon optimisation problem with safety constraints. It is shown that the decision model can replicate human drivers’ discretionary lane-change decisions with up to 92% accuracy. Further proof of concept simulation of an overtaking manoeuvre is shown, whereby the actions of the simulated vehicle are logged while the dynamic environment evolves as per ground truth data recordings.",0,0,1

"Novel EMI shielding methodology on highly integration SiP module
SiP (System-in-Package) modules play an important role to make electronic portable devices thinner, integrate more functions and reduce time to market. However, the high density of electrical functions usually causes electromagnetic noise interference (EMI) on nearby components and high level of total radiated EMI from the system product. Traditional SiP modules use a metal can to reduce EMI and this often results in an increase in both module footprint and thickness. Conformal shielding is a novel methodology to reduce EMI on molded SiP modules by using a sputtered thin metal layer on the module's top and side. In previous work, we evaluated the shielding effectiveness for single compartment module for both near field and far field conditions. As modules may contain multiple functionalities which may need to be shielded from one another, we have developed a process to construct shielded compartments by the conductive barrier inside the package, providing a way to reduce the product design area requirement. We have prepared a test vehicle with two compartments separated and with antenna coupons inside each compartment. In the paper, we present the process characterization result and measurements of the shielding effectiveness of the entire module as well as between the compartments and thereby demonstrate the advantages of SiP modules with compartment shielding.",0,1,0
"Data Science for Influencer Marketing : feature processing and quantitative analysis
Influencing a target audience through social media content has become a new focus of interest for marketing leaders. While a large amount of heterogeneous data is produced by influencers on a daily basis, professionals in the influ-encer marketing (IM) field still rely on simple quantitative metrics such as community size or engagement rate to estimate the value of an influencer.

"5G Positioning Using Code-Phase Timing Recovery
To facilitate 5G-based positioning applications, Release 16 of the 3GPP 5G standard has defined the Positioning Reference Signal (PRS), which can be used to measure Time of Arrival (TOA) for downlink positioning. However, Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing (OFDM) signals are sensitive and vulnerable to synchronization errors. Moreover, the highly configurable 5G PRS in Release 16 calls for a unique allocation pattern on the subcarriers. Existing timing recovery methods that have been employed for reference signals, which are evenly inserted in the subcarrier symbols, may not perform well. To solve the timing recovery issue of the OFDM signal through 5G standard-compliant PRS, we propose a three-stage timing recovery scheme. We use the 5G PRS as pilot symbols to estimate the path time delay and complete receiver sampling clock synchronization. We propose a generalized path time delay estimation method that can correct timing errors larger than one sample. In addition, we incorporate a delay-locked loop (DLL) that can track the PRS code-phase when the phase errors are within one sample, which showcases the precise positioning possible with a standard-compliant 5G New Radio (NR) signal.",0,0,0

Applications include vehicular power systems, renewable energy sources that generate power at a low voltage, and dc microgrids. It is noted that the cascade connection of converters in these applications may cause instability due to the fact that converters acting as loads have a constant power load (CPL) behavior. In this brief, the output voltage regulation problem of a buck–boost converter feeding a CPL is addressed. The construction of the feedback controller is based on the interconnection and damping assignment control technique. In addition, an immersion and invariance parameter estimator is proposed to compute online the extracted load power, which is difficult to measure in practical applications. It is ensured through the design that the desired operating point is (locally) asymptotically stable with a guaranteed domain of attraction. The approach is validated via computer simulations and experimental prototyping.",0,0,1
"Sensing voltage compensation circuit for low-power dram bit-line sense amplifier
As the DRAM process technology scales down, the offset voltage caused by the VTH mismatch between the Latch Transistors of Bit-Line Sense Amplifier (BLSA) tends to increase further. This offset voltage eventually leads to a data read failure by reducing the sensing voltage. To solve this problem, various types of offset cancellation BLSA have been studied. In addition to the offset voltage, the sensing noise between adjacent bit lines is another major cause of reduced sensing voltage. The solution to this problem is also necessary as the minimum feature size of the DRAM cell decreases. In this paper, we propose a Sensing Voltage Compensation (SVC) circuit for DRAM BLSA that can solve both problems simultaneously.",0,0,1

In this paper, we derive a dynamic model of a spherical rolling robot that has a new driving mechanism equipped with a gyro and design a controller to stabilize a desired translational motion of the robot. Due to the angular momentum of the gyro, nutation motion of the internal mechanism of the robot may be caused. A feedback controller is designed to achieve the stabilization to a straight motion of the robot and nutation damping in the internal mechanism simultaneously. The asymptotic stability is proved using a Lyapunov function, and the effectiveness of the controller is verified by experiments. The controller is also successfully applied to other translational motions such as a circular motion and a meandering motion.",0,1,1

"Quadcopter thrust optimization with ducted-propeller
In relation to quadcopter body frame model, propeller can be categorized into propeller with ducted and without ducted. This study present differences between those two using CFD (Computational Fluid Dynamics) method. Both categories utilize two blade-propeller with diameter of 406 (mm). Propeller rotation generates acceleration per time unit on the volume of air. Based on the behavior of generated air velocity, ducted propeller can be modeled into three versions. The generated thrust and performance on each model were calculated to determine the best model. The use of ducted propeller increases the total weight of quadcopter and also total thrust. The influence of this modeling were analyzed in detail with variation of angular velocity propeller from 1000 (rpm) to 9000 (rpm). Besides the distance between propeller tip and ducted barrier, the size of ducted is also an important part in thrust optimization and total weight minimization of quadcopter.",0,0,1

"Simulation of Bulk Current Injection Test for Automotive Components Using Electromagnetic Analysis
This paper provides a generalized technique for predicting bulk current injection (BCI) test results. The injected RF disturbance that reaches an integrated circuit (IC) is calculated using electromagnetic (EM) analysis. A three-dimensional (3-D) model of the equipment under test (EUT) can provide the terminal voltages of an IC whose references are the ground terminal of the IC, not the BCI test setup reference ground plane. Auxiliary equipment (AE) comprising an electric load and artificial networks are also modeled in 3-D, making it possible to take into account the mode conversion from common mode (CM) to differential mode. The most important technique for the modeling is the interfaces between each 3-D model. Quasi-transverse-EM port calculated by 2-D EM analysis at the cross section of the wires is adopted as the interface. In defining the failure threshold, we adopted the IC immunity macromodel for conducted immunity, which is based on the measurement of the direct RF power injection method. The proposed method was applied to several BCI tests with AEs that have different mode conversion characteristics and EUTs that have different CM impedances. The simulated results showed good correlation with the experimental results.",0,0,1
"An Experimental Approach to Characterizing the Channel Local Temperature Induced by Self-Heating Effect in FinFET
In this paper, we have developed a methodology of a lateral profiling technique of the channel local temperature in 14 nm FinFET, incurred by the self-heating effect (SHE). As SHE happens, the thermal source generated near the drain will dissipate toward the source side. Since the interaction between RTN trap and channel carriers is very sensitive to the temperature, the channel local temperature can be extracted through this interaction process between random-telegraph-noise (RTN) trap and carriers, and the position of the channel local temperature can be obtained from the RTN trap position. The results show that the highest temperature happens at the drain edge during SHE and pFinFET exhibits a much higher temperature than that of nFinFET. Furthermore, the distribution of channel local temperature can be described by the Fourier’s law of thermal conduction. Averaged channel temperature can be used to extract the thermal resistance,  $R_{\mathrm{ th}}$ , which increases rapidly as the channel length is scaled down to 20 nm, further degrading the SHE, in terms of a significant short channel effect. We also found that the incremental channel resistance is proportional to the incremental channel local temperature, whose slope indicates the degree of SHE, and the slope of pFinFET is larger than that of nFinFET. Finally, SHE will cause 10% and 14% degradation of  $I_{\mathrm{ d}} V_{\mathrm{ ds}}$  for n- and pFinFET respectively. This can be reasonably explained by the decay of saturation velocity in high temperature. The results obtained based on this methodology will help us on the understanding of the SHE impact on a nano-scaled FinFET device.",0,1,1
"A CASE STUDY OF ENGINEERING ETHICS: LESSON LEARNED FROM BUILDING COLLAPSE DISASTER TOWARD MALAYSIAN ENGINEERS
This paper presents the case study on the Hotel New World tragedy. The building collapsed on 15th March 1986 and an investigation was conducted to determine the main cause of this tragedy. There were several speculations made on the cause of the collapse such as internal explosion, bad concrete mixture and swampy land affecting the building’s foundations. However, after thorough investigations, these 
speculations were proved to be inappropriate and the main cause was found to be due to the engineer’s miscalculation during the designing stage which leads to this catastrophic failure of the building. Rescue operation was initiated immediately after the collapse to rescue the victims and the aftermath of this tragedy had led to multiple reclamations. These reclamations include the endorsement of Building Control Act 1989 along Building Control (Accredited Checkers) Regulations 1989 as a stricter quality control measure. The analysis shows that this case may be due to unwanted mistakes or negligence of the engineers in carrying out their duties. Several actions were taken according to the ethical theories and codes of ethics. However after the analysis and evaluation were done, duty ethics and right ethics were more relevant to the 
collapse of Hotel New World case as compared to the other ethical theories and thus reclamations were done based on duty ethics and right ethics",0,0,1

"High-Voltage Shore Connection Systems: Grounding Resistance Selection and Short-Circuit Currents Evaluation
Cold ironing represents an effective solution to remove air-polluting emissions from ports. The high voltage shore connection (HVSC) system is the key enabling facility that allows providing power from the shore-side electrical system to the ship. The design of the shore connection needs a comprehensive assessment of the fault currents in different operating scenarios. International standards require the neutral point of the shore connection transformer to be equipped with a neutral grounding resistor. Its value has to be defined to guarantee the safety and protection of equipment and personnel in the case of single phase-to-ground faults. Moreover, three-phase short circuits need to be considered to size equipment and protection devices. A crucial role is played by the frequency converter control system, required to adapt the mains frequency to the frequency of the ship. In this work, a complete electromagnetic dynamic model of the HVSC has been developed, including a frequency converter, a shore-side transformer, connection medium voltage (MV) cables, and a power system of the ship, to analyze in detail the behavior of the system in the case of single phase-to-ground fault and three-phase short circuit, taking into account relevant standards and best practices.",1,1,1
"Long‐term degradation rate of crystalline silicon PV modules at commercial PV plants: An 82‐MWp assessment over 10 years
Due to high competitiveness in the PV sector, despite the low degradation rate of crystalline silicon PV modules (below 0.5%/year), it is still important for utilities to know its actual value due to its impact on energy yield and hence, profitability, over the lifetime of a PV plant. However, uncertainties related to both the influence of downtime periods due to problems that may appear under normal operation of a commercial PV plant and to the measurement of degradation rates at PV plant level make this a challenging task. In order to obtain a significant value, in this paper, three measuring methods with different uncertainty sources are used for 82 MWp of PV modules on different locations in Spain and Portugal over 10 years. According to the different methods used and PV plants analyzed, excluding PV plants with problems, a range of degradation rates between 0.01 and 0.47%/year has been found. The overall average value observed is 0.27%/year. The findings of this work have also revealed the great importance of good operation and maintenance practices in order to keep overall low degradation rates.",0,1,1

"A Heterogeneous Multi-Agent System Model With Navigational Feedback for Load Demand Management of a Zonal Medium Voltage DC Shipboard Power System
Increased demand of electric ship power with emerging requirements for serving highly dynamic loads at limited power sources, has motivated the development of medium voltage DC shipboard power systems. As different types of power converters can be involved in the same system, advanced load management scheme is required to ensure stable and optimal operation under various conditions. In this paper, a heterogeneous multi-agent system model is established for the load demand management of a zonal medium voltage DC shipboard power system, where different types of DC-DC converters with diverse conversion ratios are considered as heterogeneous agents. Then, a flocking based cooperative control protocol is designed to achieve the group objective, where navigational feedback is introduced to ensure that each agent runs within a limited range. Finally, numerical simulations are conducted to verify the performance of the proposed model. Compared with the existing work, our contribution lies in: 1) The heterogeneous multi-agent system model we formulated for a combination of DC-DC converters with different types and diverse voltage levels is more consistent with the actual power system and each converter can be controlled individually according to load ratings and priorities; 2) The modified navigational feedback with the function of confining the lower and upper bound of agents can significantly improve the control effect of the cooperative control protocol.",0,0,1
"Topology optimization methods based on nonlinear and dynamic crash simulations
Topology optimization for crashworthiness has been investigated during the last years, starting from methods based on linear elastic and static simulations or so-called equivalent static loads (ESL) obtained by a single nonlinear crash simulation with a subsequent optimization loop based on the linear stiffness matrix and the corresponding sensitivities. Both methods do not consider material nonlinearities in their optimization process, which are essential for structural components designed for energy absorption, although it is well-known that plasticity and failure play an important role. As alternative, optimization methods have been proposed, which use fully nonlinear and dynamic crash simulations. The first method, presented for example in Patel’s PhD thesis, is based on a hybrid cellular automata approach (HCA) and derives optimal structures using a homogenized energy density approach where each finite element (cell) is modified until the highest degree of homogeneity is achieved. Because this is not fully appropriate for thin-walled structures, Hunkeler modified the approach (HCA-TWS – Hybrid Cellular Automata for Thin-walled Structures) such that deformation energy is only homogenized between larger structural entities (i.e. thin ribs / walls). The most recent method, the EA-LSM, a combined level set method (LSM) and evolutionary approach, was then proposed by Bujny et al. where more appropriate objectives and constraints can be used with the drawback of higher computational costs. In this paper, the latest results for HCA-TWS and EA-LSM will be presented. Special focus is here the investigation of the influence of different material models for plasticity. Examples are inspired by recent material model developments for magnesium alloys with a characteristic anisotropy in the plasticity model. As a result, it is shown that the optimal topologies depend on the material model and that it is necessary to use nonlinear and dynamic finite elements for crash topology optimization.",0,1,1
"Reconfigurable dual mode IEEE 802.15.4 digital baseband receiver for diverse IoT applications
IEEE 802.15.4 takes a center stage in IoT as Low-Rate Wireless Personal Area Networks(LR-WPANs). The standard specifies Offset Quadrature Phase Shift Keying Physical Layer (O-QPSK PHY) with half-sine pulse shaping which can be either categorized under the class of M-ary PSK signals (QPSK signal with offset) or as Minimum Shift Keying (MSK) signal. M-ary PSK demodulation requires perfect carrier synchronization and has minimal error. MSK signals which falls under Continuous Phase Frequency Shift Keying can be demodulated non-coherently but error performance is not as good. In our paper, this dual nature of IEEE 802.15.4 PHY is exploited to propose a dual mode receiver comprising of QPSK demodulator chain and MSK demodulator chain as a single system on chip. The mode can be configured manually depending on the type of application or based on feedback from a Signal to Noise (SNR) indicator employed in the proposed receiver. M-ary PSK chain is selected for lower SNRs and MSK for higher SNRs. Each of these properties are analyzed in detail for both demodulator chains and we go on to prove that MSK detection can be used for low power, low complex and low latency while QPSK detection is employed for minimal error.",0,0,0
"Linear Stochastic Dividend Model
In this paper, we propose a new model for pricing stock and dividend derivatives. We jointly specify dynamics for the stock price and the dividend rate such that the stock price is positive and the dividend rate nonnegative. In its simplest form, the model features a dividend rate that is mean-reverting around a constant fraction of the stock price. The advantage of directly specifying dynamics for the dividend rate, as opposed to the more common approach of modeling the dividend yield, is that it is easier to keep the distribution of cumulative dividends tractable. The model is nonaffine but does belong to the more general class of polynomial processes, which allows us to compute all conditional moments of the stock price and the cumulative dividends explicitly. In particular, we have closed-form expressions for the prices of stock and dividend futures. Prices of stock and dividend options are accurately approximated using a moment matching technique based on the principle of maximal entropy.",0,0,0

"Laminar and Turbulent Impinging Jet in Drag Reducing Surfactant Solutions
Cationic surfactant self-assembles a structure of wormlike micelles, which induces shear banding or shear thickening. In turbulent flow, surfactant solutions produce drag reduction, which has been applied to save pumping energy in a closed circulating system for heating and cooling. However, surfactant solutions reduce heat transfer as well as pipe friction in turbulent flow. The heat transfer reduction is a serious problem for the heating and cooling applications. Some studies reported on the enhancement of heat transfer by means of wire mesh insert, ultrasonic energy or a fluted tube-in-tube heat exchanger. These methods were thought to be effective in breakup of the shear-induced structure (SIS) which would cause the surfactant drag reduction. However, these methods dissipate extra energy, and thus the more efficient method is expected. An impinging jet can achieve high heat and mass transfer near a stagnation region, and its applications are wide: cooling of hot metal, plastic, or glass sheets, drying of paper and fabric, and micro scale cooling of electronic components. This impinging jet is composed of a free jet, a stagnation flow and a radial flow on the reflecting wall, as shown in Fig. 1. One of authors investigated pipe flow and an impinging jet using surfactant solutions. In the surfactant experiments, the molar ratio of counterion to surfactant was varied from 1 to 100. All combinations reduced frictional drag and heat transfer in the turbulent pipe flow experiments. In contrast, surfactant solutions that have a high molar ratio of counterion did not show reduction in heat transfer in the impinging jet experiments. This result suggests that an impinging jet works Laminar and Turbulent Impinging Jet in Drag Reducing Surfactant Solutions",0,1,1

"Solving the parallel batch-processing machines with different release times, job sizes, and capacity limits by metaheuristics
This study addresses the scheduling problem of parallel batch-processing machines encountered in different manufacturing environments, such as the burn-in operation in the manufacture of semiconductors and the aging test operation in the manufacture of thin film transistor-liquid crystal displays (TFT-LCDs). Each machine simultaneously processes several jobs in a batch, as long as the total size of all jobs in the batch does not exceed machine capacity. The processing time of a batch is represented by the longest time among the jobs in the batch. For this problem, a mixed integer programming (MIP) model is provided, and metaheuristics based on simulated annealing (SA) and genetic algorithm (GA) are proposed.

"Experimental Comparison of IR-UWB Radar and FMCW Radar for Vital Signs
In this paper, we compare the performances of impulse radio ultra-wideband (IR-UWB) and frequency modulation continuous wave (FMCW) radars in measuring noncontact vital signs such as respiration rate and heart rate. These two type radars have been widely used in various fields and have shown their applicability to extract vital signs in noncontact ways. IR-UWB radar can extract vital signs using distance information. On the other hand, FMCW radar requires phase information to estimate vital signs, and the result can be enhanced with Multi-input Multi-output (MIMO) antenna topologies. By using commercial radar chipsets, the operation of radars under different conditions and frequency bands will also affect the performance of vital sign detection capabilities. We compared the accuracy and signal-to-noise (SNR) ratios of IR-UWB and FMCW radars in various scenarios, such as distance, orientation, carotid pulse, harmonics, and obstacle penetration. In general, the IR-UWB radars offer a slightly better accuracy and higher SNR in comparison to FMCW radar. However, each radar system has its own unique advantages, with IR-UWB exhibiting fewer harmonics and a higher SNR, while FMCW can combine the results from each channel.",0,1,0

Photovoltaic (PV) solar power is a kind of renewable energy source that is developing rapidly in modern power systems. PV solar power producers need to generate efficient trading strategies to participate in the competitive electricity markets. In this paper, a kind of pure financial instrument called virtual bidding, which is available in the U.S. electricity markets, is used to help PV solar power producers improve profits and manage risk. A stochastic optimization model is established to co-optimize the profits of solar power offering and virtual bidding, where seasonal autoregressive integrated moving average (SARIMA) model is used for scenario generation and Conditional Value at Risk (CVaR) is used as risk measure. The proposed model is a mixed integer linear programming (MILP) problem which can be solved by existing commercial solvers to obtain the stepwise curves for solar power offering and virtual bidding simultaneously.

"High-Fidelity Shape Optimization of Non-Conventional Turbomachinery by Surrogate Evolutionary Strategies
This paper presents a novel tool for the shape optimization of turbomachinery blade profiles operating with fluids in non-ideal thermodynamic conditions and in complex flow configurations. In novel energy conversion systems, such as organic Rankine cycles or supercritical CO2 cycles, the non-conventional turbomachinery layout as well as the complex thermodynamics of the working fluid complicate significantly the blade aerodynamic design. For such applications, the design of turbomachinery may considerably benefit from the use of systematic optimization methods, especially in combination with high-fidelity computational fluid dynamics (CFD), as it is shown in this paper. The proposed technique is implemented in the shape-optimization package FORMA (Fluid-dynamic OptimizeR for turbo-Machinery Aerofoils) developed in-house at the Politecnico di Milano. FORMA is constructed as a combination of a generalized geometrical parametrization technique based on B-splines, a CFD solver featuring turbulence models and arbitrary equations of state, and multiple surrogate-based evolutionary strategies based on either trust-region or training methods. The application to the re-design of a supersonic turbine nozzle shows the capabilities of applying a high-fidelity optimization, consisting of a 50% reduction in the cascade loss coefficient and in an increased flow uniformity at the inlet of the subsequent rotor. Two alternative surrogate-based evolutionary strategies and different fitness functions are tested and discussed, including nonlinear constraints within the design process.

"A Multimodal, Enveloping Soft Gripper: Shape Conformation, Bioinspired Adhesion, and Expansion-Driven Suction
A key challenge in robotics is to create efficient methods for grasping objects with diverse shapes, sizes, poses, and properties. Grasping with hand-like end effectors often requires careful selection of hand orientation and finger placement. Here, we present a fingerless soft gripper capable of efficiently generating multiple grasping modes. It is based on a soft, cylindrical accordion structure containing coupled, parallel fluidic channels, which are controlled via pressure supplied from a single fluidic port. Inflation opens the gripper orifice for enveloping an object, while deflation allows it to produce grasping forces. The interior is patterned with a gecko-like skin that increases friction, enabling the gripper to lift objects weighing up to 20 N. Our design ensures that fragile objects, such as eggs, can be safely handled, by virtue of a wall buckling mechanism. In reverse, the gripper can be deflated to reach into an opening or orifice then inflated to grasp objects with handles or cavities. The gripper may also integrate a lip that enables it to form a seal and, upon inflating, to generate suction for lifting objects with flat surfaces. In this article, we describe the design and fabrication of this device and present an analytical model of its behavior when operated from a single fluidic port. In experiments, we demonstrate its ability to grasp diverse objects, and show that its performance is well described by our model. Our findings show how a fingerless soft gripper can efficiently perform a variety of grasping operations.

In this paper, we experimentally evaluate and compare the robustness against interference of the OQPSK-DSSS (Offset Quadrature Phase Shift Keying-Direct Sequence Spread Spectrum) and the SUN-OFDM (Smart Utility Network-Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing) physical layers, as defined in the IEEE 802.15.4-2015 standard. The objective of this study is to provide a comprehensive analysis of the impact that different levels of interference produce on these modulations, in terms of the resulting PDR (Packet Delivery Ratio) and depending on the length of the packet being transmitted. The results show that the SUN-OFDM physical layer provides significant benefits compared to the ubiquitous OQPSK-DSSS in terms of interference robustness, regardless of the interference type and the packet length. Overall, this demonstrates the suitability of choosing the SUN-OFDM physical layer when deploying low-power wireless networks in industrial scenarios, especially taking into consideration the possibility of trading-off robustness and spectrum efficiency depending on the application requirements.",1,1,0
"Mixed Palletizing and Task Completion for Virtual Warehouses
Palletizing, or packing rectangular boxes of various sizes onto pallets, is a frequently encountered task in many commercial scenarios, e.g., shipment of goods. An extension of this problem is the automated placement of boxes on pallets, henceforth task completion, by means of industrial robot arms. The palletizing and task completion problems are treated in the context of the IEEE ICRA 2012 Virtual Manufacturing Automation Competition. We approach the palletizing challenge by a winner-takes-all strategy, where multiple heuristics are evaluated against the given datasets. Our results show a performance comparable to that of the commercial software benchmark from the previous competitions. We solve task completion in USARSim by picking boxes and placing them on a pallet. Our inverse kinematics algorithm consists of a geometric and numeric component.",0,0,0
"Discriminated by an algorithm: a systematic review of discrimination and fairness by algorithmic decision-making in the context of HR recruitment and HR development
Algorithmic decision-making is becoming increasingly common as a new source of advice in HR recruitment and HR development. While firms implement algorithmic decision-making to save costs as well as increase efficiency and objectivity, algorithmic decision-making might also lead to the unfair treatment of certain groups of people, implicit discrimination, and perceived unfairness. Current knowledge about the threats of unfairness and (implicit) discrimination by algorithmic decision-making is mostly unexplored in the human resource management context. Our goal is to clarify the current state of research related to HR recruitment and HR development, identify research gaps, and provide crucial future research directions. Based on a systematic review of 36 journal articles from 2014 to 2020, we present some applications of algorithmic decision-making and evaluate the possible pitfalls in these two essential HR functions. In doing this, we inform researchers and practitioners, offer important theoretical and practical implications, and suggest fruitful avenues for future research.",0,0,0
"Beamforming techniques for massive MIMO systems in 5G: overview, classification, and trends for future research
Massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems combined with beamforming antenna array technologies are expected to play a key role in next-generation wireless communication systems (5G), which will be deployed in 2020 and beyond. The main objective of this review paper is to discuss the state-of-the-art research on the most favourable types of beamforming techniques that can be deployed in massive MIMO systems and to clarify the importance of beamforming techniques in massive MIMO systems for eliminating and resolving the many technical hitches that massive MIMO system implementation faces. Classifications of optimal beamforming techniques that are used in wireless communication systems are reviewed in detail to determine which techniques are more suitable for deployment in massive MIMO systems to improve system throughput and reduce intra- and inter-cell interference. To overcome the limitations in the literature, we have suggested an optimal beamforming technique that can provide the highest performance in massive MIMO systems, satisfying the requirements of next-generation wireless communication systems.",0,1,0
"Dispatchable Virtual Oscillator Control for Decentralized Inverter-dominated Power Systems: Analysis and Experiments
This paper presents an analysis and experimental validation of dispatchable virtual oscillator control (dVOC) for inverter-dominated power systems. dVOC is a promising decentralized control strategy that requires only local measurements to induce grid-forming behavior with programmable droop characteristics. It is dispatchable–i.e., the inverters can vary their power generation via user-defined power set-points and guarantees strong stability. To verify its feasibility, a testbed comprising multiple dVOC-programmed inverters with transmission line impedances is designed. With an embedded synchronization strategy, the dVOC inverters are capable of dynamic synchronization, black start operation, and transient grid voltage regulation with dynamic load sharing, and real-time-programmable droop characteristics for backward compatibility. All these features are experimentally verified.",0,0,1

"Investigation on the Performance of a Ducted Propeller in Oblique Flow
In this study, the ducted propeller has been numerically investigated under oblique flow, which is crucial and challenging for the design and safe operation of the thruster driven vessel and dynamic positioning (DP) system. A Reynolds-averaged Navier–Stokes (RANS) model has been first evaluated in the quasi-steady investigation on a single ducted propeller operating in open water condition, and then a hybrid RANS/LES model is adapted for the transient sliding mesh computations. A representative test geometry considered here is a marine model thruster, which is discretized with structured hexahedral cells, and the gap between the blade tip and nozzle is carefully meshed to capture the flow dynamics. The computational results are assessed by a systematic grid convergence study and compared with the available experimental data. As a part of the novel contribution, multiple incidence angles from 15 deg to 60 deg have been analyzed with different advance coefficients. The main emphasis has been placed on the hydrodynamic loads that act on the propeller blades and nozzle as well as their variation with different configurations. The results reveal that while the nozzle absorbs much effort from the oblique flow, the imbalance between blades at different positions is still noticeable. Such unbalance flow dynamics on the blades, and the nozzle has a direct implication on the variation of thrust and torque of a marine thruster.",0,1,1
"Modern mediators: intermediaries’ informational roles in sourcing from China

Purpose
Sourcing intermediaries, commonly known as agents or trading companies, represent a useful organisational solution for assisting companies to manage supply risks and to overcome the liability of foreignness. However, the landscape of global business is experiencing rapid and fundamental changes, which leads us to ask whether intermediaries will continue to play a role in global sourcing. This paper aims to understand how sourcing intermediaries ensure a lasting position in the changing setting of global sourcing and information sharing.


Design/methodology/approach
This paper investigates the operations of both Chinese and Nordic (Finnish and Swedish) intermediaries in sourcing from China by analysing qualitative data collected over a period of four years.


Findings
Through the lens of information asymmetry, this paper identifies four distinct informational roles that are used by intermediaries to reduce information asymmetry between suppliers and buyers located in different countries. The paper also examines intermediaries’ signalling activities under these roles in a cross-border triad.


Originality/value
The paper contributes to the scientific debate on the usefulness of intermediaries by underlining intermediaries’ informational advantage, which provides a new explanation for the survival of intermediaries in a rapidly changing business context. Additionally, this study contributes to research on intermediation strategies by empirically examining both Chinese and Western intermediaries, highlighting the importance of institutional contexts in affecting intermediaries’ informational roles.

A growth model for the timing of initial purchase of new products is developed and tested empirically against data for eleven consumer durables. The basic assumption of the model is that the timing of a consumer's initial purchase is related to the number of previous buyers. A behavioral rationale for the model is offered in terms of innovative and imitative behavior. The model yields good predictions of the sales peak and the timing of the peak when applied to historical data. A long-range forecast is developed for the sales of color television sets.",0,1,0
"Marketing dashboards, resource allocation and performance

Purpose
This study aims to examine the effects of marketing dashboards on resource allocation between exploratory and exploitative activities. It proposes that tactical dashboards will lead managers to place less emphasis on exploratory activities and more emphasis on exploitative activities – with performance consequences – but that these effects will be contingent on the information and decision-making environment.


Design/methodology/approach
Study hypotheses were tested using an experiment tracking objective decisions over five periods in the Markstrat simulation. A total of 105 firms, each managed by a team of Master of Business Administration students, were divided into 2 dashboard conditions and a control condition.


Findings
Teams given a tactical dashboard were less likely to engage in exploratory activities when information load was high. Tactical dashboards also suppressed exploration early in the simulation. Dashboards were associated with negative firm performance overall.


Research implications/limitations
The research suggests that dashboards can bias resource allocation, but the effects are contingent on the information and decision-making environment. Dashboards demonstrated a negative relationship with performance. The research lacked cognitive process measures and was limited to a single simulated industry type.


Practical implications
Dashboards are not a panacea for decision-making and performance and will need to change under changing conditions. Executives should build flexibility into the design and use of their dashboards and periodically audit the value the dashboard produces.


Originality/value
While widespread in marketing practice, dashboards have received little study and none involving decision-making over time and changing conditions. This research advances on limited existing work by examining objective causal effects.

"Adaptive Robust Game-Theoretic Decision Making for Autonomous Vehicles
In a typical traffic scenario, autonomous vehicles are required to share the road with other road participants, e.g., human driven vehicles, pedestrians, etc. To successfully navigate the traffic, a cognitive hierarchy theory such as level-k framework, can be used by the autonomous agents to categorize the agents based on their depth of strategic thought and act accordingly. However, mismatch between the vehicle dynamics and its predictions, and improper classification of the agents can lead to undesirable behavior or collision. Robust approaches can handle the uncertainties, however, might result in a conservative behavior of the autonomous vehicle. This paper proposes an adaptive robust decision making strategy for autonomous vehicles to handle model mismatches in the prediction model while utilizing the confidence of the driver behavior to obtain less conservative actions. The effectiveness of the proposed approach is validated for a lane change maneuver in a highway driving scenario.",0,1,1

"On the Inevitability of Online Echo Chambers
While social media make it easy to connect with and access information from anyone, they also facilitate basic influence and unfriending mechanisms that may lead to segregated and polarized clusters known as ""echo chambers."" Here we study the conditions in which such echo chambers emerge by introducing a simple model of information sharing in online social networks with the two ingredients of influence and unfriending. Users can change both opinions and social connections based on the information to which they are exposed through sharing. Model dynamics demonstrate that even with minimal amounts of influence and unfriending, the social network rapidly devolves into segregated, homogeneous communities. These predictions are consistent with empirical data from Twitter. Although our findings suggest that echo chambers are somewhat inevitable given the mechanisms at play in online social media, they also provide insights into possible mitigation strategies.",1,1,0
"Understanding which cues people use to identify influencer marketing on Instagram: an eye tracking study and experiment
Abstract While influencer marketing is gaining importance as a social media advertising strategy and guidelines require influencers to disclose the practice, it is still unclear whether Instagram users recognize and understand this type of advertising. This study aims to gain insights into the level of persuasion knowledge of influencer marketing on Instagram, and which cues Instagram users use to identify influencer marketing. An eye tracking study (N = 67) and an online experiment (N = 371) reveal that (1) Instagram users seem to be aware of influencer marketing but also make mistakes in identifying it within their Instagram feed, (2) users pay most attention to brand tags in pictures and ‘Paid partnership’ labels and least attention to #ad, and (3) disclosures, brand presence, and influencer type all influence the level of conceptual persuasion knowledge. Although previous research has shown that disclosures can be important drivers of persuasion knowledge activation, this study is the first to reveal that bottom-up factors such as brand presence and the type of influencer can also have this effect. Importantly, our findings signal that the lines between non-commercial and commercial content on Instagram are still blurred.",0,1,0
"Advanced Control Strategy of Back-to-Back PWM Converters in PMSG Wind Power System
This paper proposes a control scheme of back-to-back PWM converters for the permanent magnet synchronous generator (PMSG) wind turbine system. The DC-link voltage can be controlled at the machine-side converter (MSC), while the grid-side converter (GSC) controls the grid active power for a maximum power point tracking (MPPT). At the grid fault condition, the DC-link voltage controller is designed using a feedback linearization (FL) theory. For the MPPT, a proportional control loop is added to the torque control to reduce the influence of the inertia moment in the wind turbines, which can improve its dynamic performance. The validity of this control algorithm has been verified by the simulation of the 2-MW PMSG wind turbine system.",0,0,1

"Adaptive Observer-Based Fault-Tolerant Tracking Control for T–S Fuzzy Systems With Mismatched Faults
This paper is concerned with the observer-based fault-tolerant tracking controller design problem for a class of T–S fuzzy systems with mismatched faults and disturbances. First, a sequence of adaptive observers are constructed, based on which an iterative algorithm is given to obtain the estimations of the system states and the fault signals simultaneously. Different from the existing results which mainly focus on the compensation of matched faults, by employing an equivalent matrix transformation technique and the backsteppinglike technique, a novel observer-based fault-tolerant tracking control scheme is developed to compensate the effects of the mismatched faults and achieve the output tracking objective. Furthermore, it is proven that all the signals of the resulting closed-loop fuzzy system are uniformly ultimately bounded and the output tracking error converges to a bounded region whose upper bound is relevant to the design parameters and the estimate errors. Finally, two simulation examples are provided to illustrate the validity of the proposed controller design method.",0,1,1
"Whole-Body Walking Generation using Contact Parametrization: A Non-Linear Trajectory Optimization Approach
In this paper, we describe a planner capable of generating walking trajectories by using the centroidal dynamics and the full kinematics of a humanoid robot model. The interaction between the robot and the walking surface is modeled explicitly through a novel contact parametrization. The approach is complementarity-free and does not need a predefined contact sequence. By solving an optimal control problem we obtain walking trajectories. In particular, through a set of constraints and dynamic equations, we model the robot in contact with the ground. We describe the objective the robot needs to achieve with a set of tasks. The whole optimal control problem is transcribed into an optimization problem via a Direct Multiple Shooting approach and solved with an off-the-shelf solver. We show that it is possible to achieve walking motions automatically by specifying a minimal set of references, such as a constant desired Center of Mass velocity and a reference point on the ground.",0,1,1
"A Novel 1D State Space for Efficient Music Rhythmic Analysis
Inferring music time structures has a broad range of applications in music production, processing and analysis. Scholars have proposed various methods to analyze different aspects of time structures, such as beat, downbeat, tempo and meter. Many state-of-the-art (SOFA) methods, however, are computationally expensive. This makes them inapplicable in real-world industrial settings where the scale of the music collections can be millions. This paper proposes a new state space and a semi-Markov model for music time structure analysis. The proposed approach turns the commonly used 2D state spaces into a 1D model through a jump-back reward strategy. It reduces the state spaces size drastically. We then utilize the proposed method for causal, joint beat, downbeat, tempo, and meter tracking, and compare it against several previous methods. The proposed method delivers similar performance with the SOFA joint causal models with a much smaller state space and a more than 30 times speedup.",0,1,1

"Adaptive Short-time Fourier Transform and Synchrosqueezing Transform for Non-stationary Signal Separation
The synchrosqueezing transform, a kind of reassignment method, aims to sharpen the time-frequency representation and to separate the components of a multicomponent non-stationary signal. In this paper, we consider the short-time Fourier transform (STFT) with a time-varying parameter, called the adaptive STFT. Based on the local approximation of linear frequency modulation mode, we analyze the well-separated condition of non-stationary multicomponent signals using the adaptive STFT with the Gaussian window function. We propose the STFT-based synchrosqueezing transform (FSST) with a time-varying parameter, named the adaptive FSST, to enhance the time-frequency concentration and resolution of a multicomponent signal, and to separate its components more accurately. In addition, we also propose the 2nd-order adaptive FSST to further improve the adaptive FSST for the non-stationary signals with fast-varying frequencies. Furthermore, we present a localized optimization algorithm based on our well-separated condition to estimate the time-varying parameter adaptively and automatically. Simulation results on synthetic signals and the bat echolocation signal are provided to demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness of the proposed method.",0,0,1
"Expect the Unexpected: Harnessing Sentence Completion for Sarcasm Detection
The trigram `I love being' is expected to be followed by positive words such as `happy'. In a sarcastic sentence, however, the word `ignored' may be observed. The expected and the observed words are, thus, incongruous. We model sarcasm detection as the task of detecting incongruity between an observed and an expected word. In order to obtain the expected word, we use Context2Vec, a sentence completion library based on Bidirectional LSTM. However, since the exact word where such an incongruity occurs may not be known in advance, we present two approaches: an All-words approach (which consults sentence completion for every content word) and an Incongruous words-only approach (which consults sentence completion for the 50% most incongruous content words). The approaches outperform reported values for tweets but not for discussion forum posts. This is likely to be because of redundant consultation of sentence completion for discussion forum posts. Therefore, we consider an oracle case where the exact incongruous word is manually labeled in a corpus reported in past work. In this case, the performance is higher than the all-words approach. This sets up the promise for using sentence completion for sarcasm detection.",0,0,0

"EC-SVM approach for real-time hydrologic forecasting
This study demonstrates a combined application of chaos theory and support vector machine (SVM) in the analysis of chaotic time series with a very large sample data record. A large data record is often required and causes computational difficulty. The decomposition method is used in this study to circumvent this difficulty. The various parameters inherent in chaos technique and SVM are optimised, with the assistance of an evolutionary algorithm, to yield the minimal prediction error. The performance of the proposed scheme, EC-SVM, is demonstrated on two daily runoff time series: Tryggevaelde catchment, Denmark and the Mississippi River at Vicksburg. The prediction accuracy of the proposed scheme is compared with that of the conventional approach and the recently introduced inverse approach. This comparison shows that EC-SVM yields a significantly lower normalised RMSE value of 0.347 for the Tryggevaelde catchment runoff and 0.0385 for the Mississippi River flow compared to 0.444 and 0.2064, respectively, resulting from the conventional approach. A slight improvement in accuracy was obtained by analysing the first difference or the daily flow difference time series. It should be noted, however, that the computational speed in analysing the daily flow difference time series is significantly much faster than that of the daily flow time series.",0,1,1

"Are you aware of what you are watching? Role of machine heuristic in online content recommendations
Since recommender systems have been created and developed to automate the recommendation process, users can easily consume their desired video content on online platforms. In this line, several content recommendation algorithms are introduced and employed to allow users to encounter content of their interests, effectively. However, the recommendation systems sometimes regrettably recommend inappropriate content, including misinformation or fake news. To make it worse, people would unreservedly accept such content due to their cognitive heuristic, machine heuristic, which is the rule of thumb that machines are more accurate and trustworthy than humans. In this study, we designed and conducted a web-based experiment where the participants are invoked machine heuristic by experiencing the whole process of machine or human recommendation system. The results demonstrated that participants (N = 89) showed a more positive attitude toward a machine recommender than a human recommender, even the recommended videos contain inappropriate content. While participants who have a high level of trust in machines exhibited a negative attitude toward recommendations. Based on these results, we suggest that a phenomenon known as algorithm aversion might be simultaneously considered with machine heuristic in investigating human interaction with a machine.",0,0,0
"Deep Neural Net with Attention for Multi-channel Multi-touch Attribution
Customers are usually exposed to online digital advertisement channels, such as email marketing, display advertising, paid search engine marketing, along their way to purchase or subscribe products( aka. conversion). The marketers track all the customer journey data and try to measure the effectiveness of each advertising channel. The inference about the influence of each channel plays an important role in budget allocation and inventory pricing decisions. Several simplistic rule-based strategies and data-driven algorithmic strategies have been widely used in marketing field, but they do not address the issues, such as channel interaction, time dependency, user characteristics. In this paper, we propose a novel attribution algorithm based on deep learning to assess the impact of each advertising channel. We present Deep Neural Net With Attention multi-touch attribution model (DNAMTA) model in a supervised learning fashion of predicting if a series of events leads to conversion, and it leads us to have a deep understanding of the dynamic interaction effects between media channels.

We used computational experiment of large real world marketing dataset to demonstrate that our proposed model is superior to existing methods in both conversion prediction and media channel influence evaluation.",0,1,0
"COVID-19 Outbreak and Fashion Communication Strategies on Instagram: A Content Analysis
The COVID-19 outbreak took place end of 2019 in Wuhan city in China, and since then, it has spread across the world. The virus has not only impacted the health of millions of citizens, since, in such a globalized and interconnected system, it has also impacted on human being's daily life and activities. In this context, the volatility of the global economy has led many companies to modify and readapt their communication and marketing strategies and the fashion sector has not been exempted from these changes aimed at further engaging customers and at encouraging sales on e-commerce platforms.

It also aims to set the ground for further academic discussions on issues related to human computer interaction limits and potentials, when it comes to establishing alternative communication and marketing strategies during crises, such as the Covid19.",0,1,0
"On the determination of Hydrodynamic Coefficients for Real-Time Ship Manoeuvring Simulation
For the real-time simulation of ship manoeuvring, it is required to estimate the hydrodynamic forces with high accuracy. Current methods to determine the hydrodynamic coefficients prove to be time consuming and labour intensive. In this thesis, a method based on Singular Value Decomposition is proposed to determine the hydrodynamic coefficients from a manoeuvre executed by a vessel. The method applies Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) on the equations of motion in the horizontal plane using estimated propeller and rudder forces. With use of numerical differentiation the velocities and accelerations of the vessel are calculated. The set of coefficients determined by the method is based on low aspect ratio lift theory. By comparing the trial manoeuvres simulated with results from the MMG method, it shows that the manoeuvres agree well with the MMG results. However since the method is only tested on simulated trial manoeuvres there are still some problems to be solved such as influence of measuring errors, determining the set of coefficients to be predicted and the search for the best manoeuvre(s) to predict the coefficients.",0,0,1
"Vehicle Detection Using Deep Learning Technique in Tunnel Road Environments
This paper proposes a real-time detection method for a car driving ahead in real time on a tunnel road. Unlike the general road environment, the tunnel environment is irregular and has significantly lower illumination, including tunnel lighting and light reflected from driving vehicles. The environmental restrictions are large owing to pollution by vehicle exhaust gas. In the proposed method, a real-time detection method is used for vehicles in tunnel images learned in advance using deep learning techniques. To detect the vehicle region in the tunnel environment, brightness smoothing and noise removal processes are carried out. The vehicle region is learned after generating a learning image using the ground-truth method. The YOLO v2 model, with an optimal performance compared to the performances of deep learning algorithms, is applied. The training parameters are refined through experiments. The vehicle detection rate is approximately 87%, while the detection accuracy is approximately 94% for the proposed method applied to various tunnel road environments.",0,0,1
"Technical Note - Two-Stage Sample Robust Optimization
In “Two-Stage Sample Robust Optimization,” Bertsimas, Shtern, and Sturt investigate a simple approximation scheme, based on overlapping linear decision rules, for solving data-driven two-stage distributionally robust optimization problems with the type-infinity Wasserstein ambiguity set. Their main result establishes that this approximation scheme is asymptotically optimal for two-stage stochastic linear optimization problems; that is, under mild assumptions, the optimal cost and optimal first-stage decisions obtained by approximating the robust optimization problem converge to those of the underlying stochastic problem as the number of data points grows to infinity. These guarantees notably apply to two-stage stochastic problems that do not have relatively complete recourse, which arise frequently in applications. In this context, the authors show through numerical experiments that the approximation scheme is practically tractable and produces decisions that significantly outperform those obtained from state-of-the-art data-driven alternatives.",0,1,0

"Event-Driven Space Logistics Network Optimization with Embedded Propulsion Technology Trades
Numerous high-thrust and low-thrust space propulsion technologies have been developed in the recent years with the goal of expanding space exploration capabilities; however, designing and optimizing a multi-mission campaign with both high-thrust and low-thrust propulsion options are generally computationally challenging due to the coupling between logistics mission design and trajectory evaluation. More specifically, this computational burden arises from the dependence of the $\Delta$v and time of flight for low-thrust trajectories on the payload mass, which in turn needs to be evaluated together with the logistics mission design. To tackle this challenge, this paper develops a novel event-driven space logistics network optimization approach using mixed-integer linear programming for campaign-level space mission design. The specific case of optimally designing a cislunar propellant resupply chain to support multiple lunar surface access missions is used to demonstrate this new space logistics framework. Surrogate models for trajectory evaluation are developed and integrated into mission design to enable internal trade-offs between available propulsion technology options. The results are compared with an existing stochastic combinatorial formulation developed for incorporating low-thrust propulsion into space logistics design. Our new approach provides superior results in terms of cost as well as utilization of the vehicle fleet. The developed event-driven space logistics network optimization method can trade off cost, time, and technology in an automated manner to optimally design space mission campaigns.",0,1,0

First, we propose a three-layer architecture for the convergence of future mobility and energy systems. For each layer, we give a brief overview of the disruptive transformations that directly contribute to the rise of autonomous mobility-on-demand (AMoD) systems. Second, we propose the concept of autonomous flexibility-on-demand (AFoD), as an energy service platform built directly on existing infrastructures of AMoD systems. In the vision of AFoD, autonomous electric vehicles provide charging flexibilities as a service on demand in energy systems. Third, we identify four key decisions that, if appropriately coordinated, will create a synergy between AMoD and AFoD. Finally, we discuss key challenges regarding the system-wide coordination between AMoD and AFoD.",0,1,1
"An origami-inspired, self-locking robotic arm that can be folded flat
A self-locking foldable mechanism enables a robotic arm to be folded flat and to maintain high stiffness when deployed. A foldable arm is one of the practical applications of folding. It can help mobile robots and unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) overcome access issues by allowing them to reach into confined spaces. The origami-inspired design enables a foldable structure to be lightweight, compact, and scalable while maintaining its kinematic behavior. However, the lack of structural stiffness has been a major limitation in the practical use of origami-inspired designs. Resolving this obstacle without losing the inherent advantages of origami is a challenge. We propose a solution by implementing a simple stiffening mechanism that uses an origami principle of perpendicular folding. The simplicity of the stiffening mechanism enables an actuation system to drive shape and stiffness changes with only a single electric motor. Our results show that this design was effective for a foldable arm and allowed a UAV to perform a variety of tasks in a confined space.",0,1,1
"Power control for wireless data
With cellular phones mass-market consumer items, the next frontier is mobile multimedia communications. This situation raises the question of power control for information sources other than voice. To explore this issue, we use the concepts and mathematics of microeconomics and game theory. In this context, the quality of service of a telephone call is referred to as the ""utility"" and the distributed power control problem for a CDMA telephone is a ""noncooperative game"". The power control algorithm corresponds to a strategy that has a locally optimum operating point referred to as a ""Nash equilibrium"". The telephone power control algorithm is also ""Pareto efficient"" in the terminology of game theory. When we apply the same approach to power control in wireless data transmissions, we find that the corresponding strategy, while locally optimum, is not Pareto efficient. Relative to the telephone algorithm, there are other algorithms that produce higher utility for at least one terminal, without decreasing the utility for any other terminal. This paper presents one such algorithm. The algorithm includes a price function, proportional to the transmitter power. The price acts as a tax on the utility of a transmission. When terminals adjust their power levels to maximize the net utility (utility price), they arrive at lower power levels and higher utility than they achieve when they individually strive to maximize utility.",0,0,0

"Structural Analysis for Fault Diagnosis and Sensor Placement in Battery Packs
Energy storage systems for transportation and grid applications, and in the future for aeronautical applications, require the ability of providing accurate diagnosis to insure system availability and reliability. In such applications, battery packs may consist of hundreds or thousands of interconnected cells,and of the associated electrical/electronic hardware. This paper presents a systematic methodology for approaching some aspects of the design of battery packs, and in particular the development of diagnostic strategies, using cell models and structural diagnosis methods. First, the analytical redundancy that is intrinsic in the battery system is determined. Then, graph-theoretic tools are used to construct general structural models of two common battery pack topologies, and illustrate how the redundancy present in different measurements (current, voltage, and temperature) can be used to improve monitoring and diagnosis of a battery system. Possible sensor placement strategies that would enable the diagnosis of individual sensor faults and individual cell faults for different battery topologies are analyzed as well.While the work presented in this paper is only one step in the design of a large battery pack design, it is an important and needed advancement.",0,1,1
"A conceptual review on transformation of micro‐grid to virtual power plant: Issues, modeling, solutions, and future prospects
Enhancing the balance between demand and generation with smooth performance, the integration of renewable energy sources (RESs) plays a vital role in the smart distribution system. However, due to the inherent uncertainty and intermittent nature of RESs, many issues and challenges such as power quality, efficiency, stability, and reliability need to be taken care of for achieving an optimal operation. To resolve these associated problems, the virtual power plant (VPP) has been introduced and integrated with present smart distribution systems without sacrificing the grid stability and reliability along with offering many techno‐economic benefits. This article is a precise presentation of issues, modeling, effective management mechanism solutions, and prospects of VPP. In addition to that, the present status, guidelines, and standards prescribed for the VPP implementation are summarized. RESs have a significant effect on VPP framework coordination, and so one important aspect related to RESs scheduling in VPP is explained in this article. Bidding strategy optimization problems, the participation of the electric market, and technical innovation reforms are discussed in line with the VPP. This review gives a comprehensive outline of transforming micro‐grid to VPP and conveys much information to researchers, consumers, prosumers, and utility operators.",0,0,1
"Multiphysical modeling and description of a permanent magnet synchronous machine using energetic macroscopic representation for EV/HEV applications
Because it does not participate in the vehicle traction, the thermal energy is not highlighted in the electric and hybrid electric vehicle (EV and HEV) study, especially for electrical components like electric machines and batteries. Nevertheless, the thermal states of these components can have a great impact on the vehicle behaviour, such as safety, performances and autonomy, etc. This impact is more important if the driver turns on the heating system. In order to consider the thermal dimension of the energetic study for EV/HEV applications, a multiphysical modeling and description (for organizing this model with the energetic focus) of each component is required.

"OpenSHC: A Versatile Multilegged Robot Controller
Multilegged robots have the ability to perform stable locomotion on relatively rough terrain. However, the complexity of legged robots over wheeled or tracked robots make them difficult to control. This paper presents OpenSHC (Open-source Syropod High-level Controller), a versatile high-level controller capable of generating gaits and poses for quasi-static multilegged robots, both simulated and with real hardware implementations. With full Robot Operating System (ROS) integration, the controller can be quickly deployed on robots with different actuators and sensor payloads. The flexibility of OpenSHC is demonstrated on the 30 degrees of freedom hexapod Bullet, analysing the energetic performance of various leg configurations, kinematic arrangements and gaits over different locomotion speeds. With OpenSHC being easily configured to different physical and locomotion specifications, a hardware-based parameter space search for optimal locomotion parameters is conducted. The experimental evaluation shows that the mammalian configuration offers lower power consumption across a range of step frequencies; with the insectoid configuration providing performance advantages at higher body velocities and increased stability at low step frequencies.

"Extending mathematical model of permanent magnet synchronous motors in alpha-beta coordinate system for EKF
This paper deals with the derivation of the permanent magnet synchronous motor (PMSM) model in alpha-beta coordinate system. The exact model of PMSM is essential for rotor position and speed estimation algorithms. Information about the rotor position is necessary even to be able to control drive speed. Extended Kalman filter (EKF) was used to estimate the rotor position. Conventional algorithms based on EKF are developed using a simple model of permanent magnet synchronous motor (Ld = Lq = Ls), thereby they provide bad performance in the low speeds. Extended mathematical performance in the (Ld ≠ Lq ≠ Ls) makes possible for EKF to operate in low speeds, because information about rotor position is contained in changes of stator inductance.",0,1,1

"Contribution of the transverse arch to foot stiffness in humans
Stiffness of the human foot is central to its mechanical function, such as elastic energy storage and propulsion. Its doubly-arched structure, manifested as longitudinal and transverse arches, is thought to underlie the stiff nature. However, previous studies have focused solely on the longitudinal arch, and little is known about whether and how the transverse arch impacts the foot's stiffness. The common observation that a flexible currency bill significantly stiffens upon curling it transversally underlies our hypothesis that the transverse arch dominates the foot's stiffness. Through human subject experiments, we show that transversally reinforcing the ball of the foot by means of sports tape can increase the midfoot bending (dorsiflexion) stiffness by 53% on average. Such a result is possible if and only if midfoot bending is mechanically coupled with splaying of the distal metatarsal heads, thus engaging the distal transverse ligament. Using a simplified foot model, we elucidate a mechanism for such coupling to arise because of the transverse arch; namely transverse curvature couples sagittal plane bending with stretching along the transverse direction. We therefore conclude that the previously ignored distal metatarsal transverse ligaments, by way of the transverse arch, likely underlie the midfoot's elastic response by an amount comparable to or surpassing the plantar fascia, the windlass mechanism and other longitudinal tissues. Our findings impact current practice in clinical, sports and evolutionary biomechanics that focus solely on the longitudinal arch and on two-dimensional sagittal plane mechanics.",0,0,1

"Formative versus reflective measurement models: two applications of formative measurement | NOVA. The University of Newcastle's Digital Repository
This paper presents a framework that helps researchers to design and validate both formative and reflective measurement models. The framework draws from the existing literature and includes both theoretical and empirical considerations. Two important examples, one from international business and one from marketing, illustrate the use of the framework. Both examples concern constructs that are fundamental to theory-building in these disciplines, and constructs that most scholars measure reflectively. In contrast, applying the framework suggests that a formative measurement model may be more appropriate. These results reinforce the need for all researchers to justify, both theoretically and empirically, their choice of measurement model. Use of an incorrect measurement model undermines the content validity of constructs, misrepresents the structural relationships between them, and ultimately lowers the usefulness of management theories for business researchers and practitioners. The main contribution of this paper is to question the unthinking assumption of reflective measurement seen in much of the business literature.",0,1,0
"Passive Tool Changer Development for an Elastic and Compliant Manipulator
Robotic tool changers allow the use of multiple tools or end-effectors by a robotic manipulator and eliminate the need for human intervention to change tools. In this paper, we present the design and testing of a passive mechanical tool changer designed for a project involving the inspection of an acidic and radioactive air duct. The tool changer relied on the active/passive motions of a compliant manipulator to perform tool changes and contains no electrical or pneumatic components. The resulting tool changing operation utilizes a developed compliant controller that relies exclusively on contact forces to guide the manipulator, and thus eliminates the need for precision operation or any assistance from the operator. The design features a locking system to ensure secure storage of tools that are not in use. Furthermore, the connection mechanism includes a bore scope camera for use when tools are not attached or to visually verify tool connections. Testing and demonstrations were performed to validate both the design and operation as well as show both the tools and tool changer perform in an extreme environment.

"Design and modeling of MEMS SAW resonator on Lithium Niobate
Surface Acoustic Wave (SAW) resonators are essential components for modern communication systems. They can function as filters and frequency synthesizers. SAW resonators operate based on the principle of acoustic waves propagating along the surface of a solid piezoelectric material. The waves are generated by injecting electrical energy using interdigitated transducers (IDTs) into the piezoelectric material which transforms it into propagating mechanical waves. This project intends to study the key design parameters that affect the performance of SAW resonator such as optimum spacing between IDT and reflector, optimum spacing of IDTs and the numbers of reflector in order to get the highest mechanical displacement. Key requirements of a SAW resonator include having precise resonant frequency (fr), low insertion losses, and high quality factors (Q). To meet these requirements, it is necessary to investigate the key design parameters; number of reflectors, number of IDTs, periodic distance of transducer fingers (λ), spacing between IDT and reflector.

"INTEGRATED CO2 HEAT PUMP SYSTEMS FOR SPACE HEATING AND HOT WATER HEATING IN LOW-ENERGY HOUSES AND PASSIVE HOUSES
Low-energy and passive houses are superinsulated and air-tight buildings where the space heating demand is considerably lower than that of buildings constructed in accordance with common buildings codes. Due to the low space heating demand, the annual heating demand for domestic hot water (DHW) typically constitutes 50 to 85% of the total annual heating demand in the residence. A heat pump system can be used to cover the heating demands in low-energy houses and passive houses. The heat pump system can be designed as stand-alone systems, i.e. a heat pump water heater (HPWH) in combination with separate units for space heating, or be an integrated unit for combined space heating and hot water heating (IHPS). Due to compact design, the latter system is most likely to achieve the lowest investment and installation costs and with that the best profitability. Integrated residential heat pump systems using carbon dioxide (CO2, R744) as a working fluid can achieve high Coefficient of Performance (COP) due to the unique characteristics of the transcritical cycle with heat rejection in a gas cooler at a gliding CO2 temperature. Integrated CO2 heat pumps for space heating and hot water heating can be designed to utilize different heat sources such as bedrock, ground, exhaust ventilation air, ambient air or a combination of exhaust ventilation air and ambient air. Different integrated CO2 heat pump systems have been investigated, focusing on the design of the gas cooler and the DHW system. It was found that a counter-flow tripartite CO2 gas cooler in combination with an external single-shell hot water tank and a low-temperature heat distribution system, would enable production of DHW in the required temperature range from 60 to 85oC and contribute to the highest possible COP for the CO2 heat pump system. The Seasonal Performance Factor (SPF) for a prototype brine-to-water CO2 heat pump was calculated on the basis of laboratory measurements and compared with the performance of a highefficiency HFC brine-to-water heat pump unit. At DHW heating demand ratios above approximately 50%, the CO2 heat pump system outperformed the HFC heat pump system. Consequently, integrated CO2 heat pump systems equipped with a tripartite gas cooler represent a very promising, high-efficiency system for combined space heating and DHW heating in low-energy and passive houses. The results presupposes the use of a low-temperature space heating system and optimized design of the DHW tank in order to minimize thermodynamic losses caused by mixing of hot and cold water and conductive heat transfer inside the tank.",0,1,1
"Bridge identification and damage detection using contact point response difference of moving vehicle
This paper presents the use of a moving vehicle to identify the bridge mode shapes and detect possible damage in the presence of bridge surface roughness. The method utilises the contact point responses at the contact between the wheel and bridge surface, which can be obtained from the vehicle responses and has a direct relation with the bridge responses and surface roughness. A double‐pass mass‐addition technique is proposed to obtain the contact point response difference using a test vehicle installed with sensors. Then the bridge frequencies can be identified from its spectrum, while the mode shapes can be further obtained by signal filtering and Hilbert transform. Simulation results show that the adverse effect of surface roughness on the contact point acceleration difference is largely reduced. The first three frequencies and mode shapes can be extracted with satisfactory accuracy. Multiple damage locations can be identified by performing wavelet transform on the contact point displacement difference and applying coordinate modal assurance criterion to the mode shapes constructed. The factors that may affect the performance of the proposed method are also investigated, including the distribution of added mass, measurement noise, speed of the test vehicle and co‐existing traffic. Experimental validation is conducted on a simply supported aluminium channel beam with artificial roughness carrying a moving model vehicle. The results show that the proposed methodology for bridge identification works in the presence of road surface roughness.",0,1,1
"Compact ESD Protection Design for CMOS Low-Noise Amplifier
A low-noise amplifier (LNA) is the input part of a radio frequency (RF) transceiver, which is vulnerable to electrostatic discharge (ESD).

"Deep Recurrent Electricity Theft Detection in AMI Networks with Random Tuning of Hyper-parameters
Modern smart grids rely on advanced metering infrastructure (AMI) networks for monitoring and billing purposes. However, such an approach suffers from electricity theft cyberattacks. Different from the existing research that utilizes shallow, static, and customer-specific-based electricity theft detectors, this paper proposes a generalized deep recurrent neural network (RNN)-based electricity theft detector that can effectively thwart these cyberattacks. The proposed model exploits the time series nature of the customers' electricity consumption to implement a gated recurrent unit (GRU)-RNN, hence, improving the detection performance. In addition, the proposed RNN-based detector adopts a random search analysis in its learning stage to appropriately fine-tune its hyper-parameters. Extensive test studies are carried out to investigate the detector's performance using publicly available real data of 107,200 energy consumption days from 200 customers. Simulation results demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed detector compared with state-of-the-art electricity theft detectors.",0,1,1
"Learning robust perceptive locomotion for quadrupedal robots in the wild
Legged robots that can operate autonomously in remote and hazardous environments will greatly increase opportunities for exploration into underexplored areas. Exteroceptive perception is crucial for fast and energy-efficient locomotion: Perceiving the terrain before making contact with it enables planning and adaptation of the gait ahead of time to maintain speed and stability. However, using exteroceptive perception robustly for locomotion has remained a grand challenge in robotics. Snow, vegetation, and water visually appear as obstacles on which the robot cannot step or are missing altogether due to high reflectance. In addition, depth perception can degrade due to difficult lighting, dust, fog, reflective or transparent surfaces, sensor occlusion, and more. For this reason, the most robust and general solutions to legged locomotion to date rely solely on proprioception. This severely limits locomotion speed because the robot has to physically feel out the terrain before adapting its gait accordingly. Here, we present a robust and general solution to integrating exteroceptive and proprioceptive perception for legged locomotion. We leverage an attention-based recurrent encoder that integrates proprioceptive and exteroceptive input. The encoder is trained end to end and learns to seamlessly combine the different perception modalities without resorting to heuristics. The result is a legged locomotion controller with high robustness and speed. The controller was tested in a variety of challenging natural and urban environments over multiple seasons and completed an hour-long hike in the Alps in the time recommended for human hikers. Description A legged locomotion controller achieves high robustness and speed in the wild by combining multimodal information.",0,0,1
"Performance Analysis of OTFS Modulation With Receive Antenna Selection
In this paper, we analyze the performance of orthogonal time frequency space (OTFS) modulation with antenna selection at the receiver, where $n_s$ out of $n_r$ receive antennas with maximum channel Frobenius norms in the delay-Doppler (DD) domain are selected. Single-input multiple-output OTFS (SIMO-OTFS), multiple-input multiple-output OTFS (MIMO-OTFS), and space-time coded OTFS (STC-OTFS) systems with receive antenna selection (RAS) are considered. We consider these systems without and with phase rotation. Our diversity analysis results show that, with no phase rotation, SIMO-OTFS and MIMO-OTFS systems with RAS are rank deficient, and therefore they do not extract the full receive diversity as well as the diversity present in the DD domain. Also, Alamouti coded STC-OTFS system with RAS and no phase rotation extracts the full transmit diversity, but it fails to extract the DD diversity. On the other hand, SIMO-OTFS and STC-OTFS systems with RAS become full-ranked when phase rotation is used, because of which they extract the full spatial as well as the DD diversity present in the system. Also, when phase rotation is used, MIMO-OTFS systems with RAS extract the full DD diversity, but they do not extract the full receive diversity because of rank deficiency. Simulation results are shown to validate the analytically predicted diversity performance.",0,1,0
"Iterative Learning Control Integrated with Model Predictive Control for Real-Time Disturbance Rejection of Batch Processes
In the present paper, iterative learning control (ILC) is integrated with a model predictive control (MPC) technique to reject real-time disturbances. The proposed scheme is called iterative learning model predictive control (ILMPC). ILC is an e ective control technique for batch processes, but it is not a real-time feedback controller. Thus, it should be combined with MPC for real-time disturbance rejection. The existing ILMPC techniques make the error converge to zero. However, if the error converges to zero, an impractical input trajectory may be calculated. We use a generalized objective function to independently tune weighting factors of manipulated variable change with respect to both the time index and batch horizons. If the generalized objective function is used, output error converges to non-zero values. We provide convergence analysis for both cases of zero convergence and non-zero convergence.",0,0,1
"Numerical analysis and validation of spray distributions disturbed by quad-rotor drone wake at different flight speeds
Abstract The computational fluid dynamics method based on the lattice Boltzmann method (LBM), was used to simulate the downwash flow field of a quad-rotor drone. The downwash flow fields of a quad-rotor drone at flight speeds of 1–7 m/s and flight altitudes of 1–2 m were simulated. The horseshoe-shaped vortices were successfully captured at a speed exceeding 5 m/s. In order to capture the deposition and drift distribution of droplets with different sizes in the downwash flow field of a quad-rotor drone more accurately, the Lagrangian discrete phase particle tracking method was used to simulate the trajectories of droplets with different particle sizes. By changing the flight speed, flight altitude, vertical height of the boom from the rotor, and lateral distance between the nozzles, the effects of these conditions on the droplet deposition and drift behind the fuselage were studied. The accuracy of the numerical simulation was verified by a wind tunnel test. The results of the numerical simulation were in good agreement with the data from the wind tunnel test. It is shown that the computational fluid dynamics model developed in the paper can be successfully applied to the simulations of droplet drift and deposition of a quad-rotor plant protection drone.",0,1,1

"Approximate model predictive building control via machine learning
Abstract Many studies have proven that the building sector can significantly benefit from replacing the current practice rule-based controllers (RBC) by more advanced control strategies like model predictive control (MPC). However, the optimization-based control algorithms, like MPC, impose increasing hardware and software requirements, together with more complicated error handling capabilities required from the commissioning staff. In recent years, several studies introduced promising remedy for these problems by using machine learning algorithms. The idea is based on devising simplified control laws learned from MPC. The main advantage of the proposed methods stems from their easy implementation even on low-level hardware. However, most of the reported studies were dealing only with problems with a limited complexity of the parametric space, and devising laws only for a single control variable, which inevitably limits their applicability to more complex building control problems. In this paper, we introduce a versatile framework for synthesis of simple, yet well-performing control strategies that mimic the behavior of optimization-based controllers, also for large scale multiple-input-multiple-output (MIMO) control problems which are common in the building sector. The approach employs multivariate regression and dimensionality reduction algorithms. Particularly, deep time delay neural networks (TDNN) and regression trees (RT) are used to derive the dependency of multiple real-valued control inputs on parameters. The complexity of the problem, as well as implementation cost, are further reduced by selecting the most significant features from the set of parameters. This reduction is based on straightforward manual selection, principal component analysis (PCA) and dynamic analysis of the building model. The approach is demonstrated on a case study employing temperature control in a six-zone building, described by a linear model with 286 states and 42 disturbances, resulting in an MPC problem with more than thousand of parameters. The results show that simplified control laws retain most of the performance of the complex MPC, while significantly decreasing the complexity and implementation cost.",0,1,1

"Visualization of ranking data: Geographical signatures in international collaboration, leadership and research impact
In this work we address the comprehensive Scimago Institutions Ranking 2012, proposing a data visualization of the listed bibliometric indicators for the 509 Higher Education Institutions among the 600 largest research institutions ranked according to their outputs. We focus on research impact, internationalization and leadership indicators, which became important benchmarks in a worldwide discussion about research quality and impact policies for universities. Our data visualization reveals a qualitative difference between the behavior of Northern American and Western European Higher Education Institutions concerning International collaboration levels. Chinese universities show still a systematic low international collaboration levels which are positively linked to the low research impact. The data suggests that research impact can be related directly to internationalization only to rather low values for both indicators. Above world average, other determinants may become relevant in fostering further impact.

"MIMO Radar for Advanced Driver-Assistance Systems and Autonomous Driving: Advantages and Challenges
Important requirements for automotive radar are high resolution, low hardware cost, and small size. Multiple-input, multiple-output (MIMO) radar technology has been receiving considerable attention from automotive radar manufacturers because it can achieve a high angular resolution with relatively small numbers of antennas. For that ability, it has been exploited in the current-generation automotive radar for advanced driverassistance systems (ADAS) as well as in next-generation highresolution imaging radar for autonomous driving.

"A Comparison of CP-OFDM, PCC-OFDM and UFMC for 5G Uplink Communications
Polynomial-cancellation-coded orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (PCC-OFDM) is a form of OFDM that has waveforms which are very well localized in both the time and frequency domains and so it is ideally suited for use in the 5G network. This paper analyzes the performance of PCC-OFDM in the uplink of a multiuser system using orthogonal frequency division multiple access (OFDMA) and compares it with conventional cyclic prefix OFDM (CP-OFDM), and universal filtered multicarrier (UFMC). PCC-OFDM is shown to be very much less sensitive to time and frequency offsets than either CP-OFDM or UFMC. For a given constellation size, PCC-OFDM in additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN) requires 3 dB lower signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) for a given bit-error-rate, and the SNR advantage of PCC-OFDM increases rapidly when there are timing and/or frequency offsets. For PCC-OFDM no frequency guard-band is required between different OFDMA users. PCC-OFDM is completely compatible with CP-OFDM and adds negligible complexity and latency, because it uses a simple mapping of data onto pairs of subcarriers at the transmitter, and a simple weighting-and-adding of pairs of subcarriers at the receiver. The weighting-and-adding step, which has been omitted in some of the literature, is shown to contribute substantially to the SNR advantage of PCC-OFDM. A disadvantage of PCC-OFDM (without overlapping) is the potential reduction in spectral efficiency because subcarriers are modulated in pairs, but this reduction is more than regained because no guard band is required and because, for a given channel, larger constellations can be used.",0,0,0
"Energy geo-storage — analysis and geomechanical implications
The increasing energy demand, the mismatch between generation and load, and the growing use of renewable energy accentuate the need for energy storage. In this context, energy geo-storage provides various alternatives, the use of which depends on the quality of surplus energy. In terms of power and energy capacity, large mechanical energy storage systems such as Compressed Air Energy Storage (CAES) and Pumped Hydro Storage (PHS) are cost-effective and suitable for centralized power generation. In contrast, sensible and latent heat storage are appropriate for distributed applications when excess heat is involved. Energy density estimations highlight the advantages of compressed air over elevated water, and latent heat over sensible heat storage. From a geotechnical standpoint, the operation of geo-storage systems exerts complex effective stress, temperature, wet-dry, and freeze-thaw cycles. Although these excitations may not cause monotonic failure, they lead to ratcheting or shakedown behavior, both of which must be carefully analyzed to ensure the proper long-term cyclic response of energy geo-storage systems.",0,1,1

"Applications of Nanotechnology in Sensor-Based Detection of Foodborne Pathogens
The intake of microbial-contaminated food poses severe health issues due to the outbreaks of stern food-borne diseases. Therefore, there is a need for precise detection and identification of pathogenic microbes and toxins in food to prevent these concerns. Thus, understanding the concept of biosensing has enabled researchers to develop nanobiosensors with different nanomaterials and composites to improve the sensitivity as well as the specificity of pathogen detection. The application of nanomaterials has enabled researchers to use advanced technologies in biosensors for the transfer of signals to enhance their efficiency and sensitivity.

"On Exposure Bias, Hallucination and Domain Shift in Neural Machine Translation
The standard training algorithm in neural machine translation (NMT) suffers from exposure bias, and alternative algorithms have been proposed to mitigate this. However, the practical impact of exposure bias is under debate. In this paper, we link exposure bias to another well-known problem in NMT, namely the tendency to generate hallucinations under domain shift. In experiments on three datasets with multiple test domains, we show that exposure bias is partially to blame for hallucinations, and that training with Minimum Risk Training, which avoids exposure bias, can mitigate this. Our analysis explains why exposure bias is more problematic under domain shift, and also links exposure bias to the beam search problem, i.e. performance deterioration with increasing beam size. Our results provide a new justification for methods that reduce exposure bias: even if they do not increase performance on in-domain test sets, they can increase model robustness to domain shift.",0,0,0
"Multi-Gigabit Wireline Systems over Copper: An Interference Cancellation Perspective

"Psychological Operations in Digital Political Campaigns: Assessing Cambridge Analytica's Psychographic Profiling and Targeting
This paper explores whether psychographic profiling and targeting married with big data and deployed in digital political campaigns is a form of psychological operations (“psy-ops”). Informed by studies on deception, coercion, and influence activities from propaganda, persuasion, policy making, cognitive psychology, information, and marketing scholarship, this proposition is examined and historically grounded in a politically important case study: the actions of now defunct political data analytics and behaviour change company, Cambridge Analytica, in the UK's 2016 referendum campaign on leaving the European Union. Based on qualitative analysis of documentation in the UK and USA from public inquiries, regulatory investigations, legal proceedings, and investigative journalists, as well as on revelations from digital political campaigners and Cambridge Analytica itself, this paper assesses the coercive and deceptive nature of Cambridge Analytica's psychographic profiling and targeting, concluding that it is a form of psy-ops. Observing the social unacceptability of such digital campaigning practices (ascertained from national surveys in the US, UK, and globally), this paper discusses the adequacy of measures since put in place to eliminate the risk of further psy-ops in digital political campaigning.

Moreover, this amplifier provides an output voltage swing that is almost twice that obtained with single-ended amplifiers. Finally, the two differential pairs at the FDDA input eliminate the need for impedance isolation buffers and matching resistors, consequently reducing system noise for improved sensitivity and accuracy.

Summary. — A popular way to accelerate the sampling of rare events in molecular dynamics simulations is to introduce a potential that increases the ﬂuctuations of selected collective variables.

"Performance assessment of Synchronous Condensers vs Voltage Source Converters providing grid-forming functions
Having sufficient grid-forming sources is one of the necessary conditions to guarantee the stability in a power system hosting a very large share of inverter-based generation. The grid-forming function has been historically fulfilled by synchronous machines. However, with the appropriate control, it can also be provided by voltage source converters (VSC). This work presents a comparison between two technologies with grid-forming capability: the VSC with a grid-forming control coupled with an adequate energy storage system, and the synchronous condensers (SC). Both devices are compared regarding their inertial response, as well as their contribution to the system strength and short-circuit current for an equivalent capacity expressed in terms of apparent power and inertial reserve. Their behaviour following grid disturbances is assessed through time-domain simulations based on detailed electromagnetic transient (EMT) models. The results show that both devices achieve similar performance in the timescale of seconds. For shorter time-windows, however, they present a different behavior: the SC ensures a better stiffness in the first tens of ms following the disturbance, while the VSC offers a faster resynchronization.",0,0,1
"Dynamic event‐triggering based design of sliding mode control
This article presents a new event‐triggering based design of sliding mode control (SMC) for the control of a dynamical system against external perturbations. This triggering mechanism aims to generate a sparser sampling pattern than the existing one while achieving the minimum resource utilization. The triggering mechanism employs scalar dynamics, hence it is called the dynamic event‐triggering mechanism, which acts as a filter for the triggering condition. The output of this dynamics is used in the event condition in addition to a constant threshold while the part of the event function is fed as an input to this filter. The existing design algorithms for event‐triggered SMC may not guarantee an increase in the inter event time for the dynamic event‐triggering strategy. An alternative approach to this is proposed for the design of dynamic triggering based SMC where we partially relax the dependency of SMC gain on the event parameter without affecting the steady‐state performance for the closed‐loop system. It is shown that the proposed design achieves a larger inter event time leading to a sparser triggering sequence. We guarantee the stability by showing the convergence of state trajectories of the closed‐loop system within any desired bound around the origin for the proposed triggering mechanism, and also the absence of the Zeno phenomenon in the triggering sequence is established. Finally, an illustration of the proposed scheme is presented in a simulation study for a mass‐spring‐damper system.",0,0,1

Co-curricular and extracurricular involvement plays important roles in students’ cognitive and effective development, educational effectiveness and satisfaction, and sense of belonging. Moreover, these practices can help equip a diverse population with the academic and professional skills necessary to succeed in the technological workforce. Yet undergraduate engineering students are consistently less likely than students in other majors to become involved in co-curricular and extracurricular activities.

"A proportional-fair power allocation scheme for fair and efficient multiuser OFDM systems
In this paper we investigate adaptive resource allocation schemes in multiuser OFDM systems for fair share of resources and efficient operation. We employ the CDF-based scheduling (CS) algorithm for the subcarrier allocation, taking advantage of its distinctive feature of analyzability and multiuser diversity. Noting that conventional power allocation schemes do not exhibit efficient and fair operations in heterogeneous user channel environments, we present a new algorithm called proportional-fair power allocation (PFPA). This algorithm is designed to allocate transmission power in such a way that the resulting relative throughput-increment is identical for all subcarriers. The PFPA algorithm is shown to be equivalent to the power allocation of the asymptotically optimal algorithm which exhibits the largest achievable region in the asymptotic case. Numerical results reveal that the combined CS-PFPA algorithm improves the overall system capacity in terms of time-average throughput and provides efficient estimation of user performance. Further, the CS-PFPA algorithm can meet each user's requirements using a minimum amount of resources, so it renders an efficient and fair means for resource allocation in multiuser OFDM systems.",0,0,0
"A vertex-weighted-Least-Squares gradient reconstruction
Gradient reconstruction is a key process for the spatial accuracy and robustness of finite volume method, especially in industrial aerodynamic applications in which grid quality affects reconstruction methods significantly. A novel gradient reconstruction method for cell-centered finite volume scheme is introduced. This method is composed of two successive steps. First, a vertex-based weighted-least-squares procedure is implemented to calculate vertex gradients, and then the cell-centered gradients are calculated by an arithmetic averaging procedure. By using these two procedures, extended stencils are implemented in the calculations, and the accuracy of gradient reconstruction is improved by the weighting procedure. In the given test cases, the proposed method is showing improvement on both the accuracy and convergence. Furthermore, the method could be extended to the calculation of viscous fluxes.",0,0,1
"Adaptive robust model predictive control for nonlinear systems
Modeling error and external disturbances can severely degrade the performance of Model Predictive Control (MPC) in real-world scenarios. Robust MPC (RMPC) addresses this limitation by optimizing over control policies but at the expense of computational complexity. An alternative strategy, known as tube MPC, uses a robust controller (designed offline) to keep the system in an invariant tube centered around a desired nominal trajectory (generated online). While tube MPC regains tractability, there are several theoretical and practical problems that must be solved for it to be used in real-world scenarios. First, the decoupled trajectory and control design is inherently suboptimal, especially for systems with changing objectives or operating conditions. Second, no existing tube MPC framework is able to capture state-dependent uncertainty due to the complexity of calculating invariant tubes, resulting in overly-conservative approximations. And third, the inability to reduce statedependent uncertainty through online parameter adaptation/estimation leads to systematic error in the trajectory design. This thesis aims to address these limitations by developing a computationally tractable nonlinear tube MPC framework that is applicable to a broad class of nonlinear systems.

"The effect of Dust and Sand on the 5G Millimeter-Wave links
The wireless connections are a communication channel used to support different applications in our life such as microwave connections, mobile cellular networks, and intelligent transportation systems. The wireless communication channels are affected by different weather factor such as rain, snow, fog, dust, and sand. This effect is more evident in the high frequencies of the millimeter wave (mm-wave) band. Recently, the 5G opened the door to support different applications with high speed and good quality. A recent study investigates the effect of rain and snow on the 5G communication channel to reduce the challenge of using high millimeter-wave frequencies. This research investigates the impact of dust and sand on the communication channel of 5G mini links using Mie scattering model to estimate the propagating wave’s attenuation by computing the free space loss of a dusty region. Also, the cross-polarization of the propagating wave with dust and sand is taken into account at different distances of the propagating length. Two kinds of mini links, ML-6363, and ML-6352, are considered to demonstrate the effect of dust and sand in this specific operating frequency bands. The 73.5 GHz (V-band) and (21.5GHz (K-band) are the ML-6352 and ML-6363 radio frequency, respectively. Also, signal depolarization is another important radio frequency transmission parameter that is considered heroin. The numerical and simulation results show that the 5G ML-6352 is more affected by dust and sand than ML6363. The Simulink on MATLAB is used to build the communication system and simulate the effect of the dust and sand at different frequency bands.",0,1,0
"An Adjoint Optimization Approach to Network Topology and Discrete Pipe Size Design for District Heating Networks
This article deals with the problem of finding the best topology, pipe diameter choices, and operation parameters for district heating networks. We introduce an alternative adjoint-based numerical optimization strategy that aims at enabling large-scale nonlinear thermal network optimization. This allows the optimal design tool to start from a bottom-up transport-based district heating network model. We introduce a proof-of-concept design formulation that optimizes the network for minimal investment cost and pumping power, while keeping the heat supplied to the consumers within a thermal comfort range of 5 %. Several challenges in applying the adjoint optimization strategy to district heating network design are overcome in this paper. First, we avoid a strong computational cost scaling with the network size by introducing a constraint aggregation strategy. Secondly, we present a numerical continuation strategy that gradually forces the continuous optimization method towards discrete design variable choices. As such, network topology and discrete pipe size choices are determined simultaneously. Finally, we employ the algorithm for the design of a fictitious but realistically-sized district heating network with 160 consumers. Starting from a uniform distribution of 15 cm wide piping throughout the network, the novel algorithm finds a network lay-out that reduces piping investment by 23 % and pump-related costs by a factor of 14 in less than an hour on a standard laptop. Moreover, the importance of embedding a non-linear transport model is clear from a temperature-induced variation in the consumer flow rates of 72 %.",0,0,1
"The Fall and Rise of Strategic Planning
When strategic planning arrived on the scene in the mid-1960s, corporate leaders embraced it as “the one best way” to devise and implement strategies that would enhance the competitiveness of each business unit. True to the scientific management pioneered by Frederick Taylor, this one best way involved separating thinking from doing and creating a new function staffed by specialists: strategic planners. Planning systems were expected to produce the best strategies as well as step-by-step instructions for carrying out those strategies so that the doers, the managers of businesses, could not get them wrong.

Once a fairly esoteric subject, risk analysis and measurement has become a critical function for both portfolio managers and traders. Yet, accurate measurement and analysis of risk presents many practical challenges including the choice of risk model, pitfalls in portfolio optimization, horizon mismatches, and out-of-sample testing. This article provides a detailed overview of recent developments in risk analysis and modeling, with a focus on practical applications for both portfolio managers and traders. We demonstrate that these tools can provide invaluable insights regarding portfolio risk, but must be applied with considerable care.

"The Influences of Solvency, Cash Flow Ratio and Profitabiliy toward Going Concern Opinion
In providing an audit opinion, some assumptions must be met, one of which is that it will continue. In terms of corporate sustainability accounting, this is called a going concern. To evaluate whether the company has a going concern, an auditor can look at several indicators. These indicators include solvency, cash flow, and profitability. This study attempts to investigate the effect of these three variables towards audit going concern. Multiple linear regression statistical methods are used to link them with the going concern level. Based on the research results on 56 companies listed on the Indonesia Stock Exchange from 2017 to 2019, it can be concluded that solvency, cash flow, and profitability significantly affect the company.",0,0,0
"Measuring scattering function of HF NVIS channel by sounding with the use of a noise-like BPSK signal
Measuring parameters of the scattering function of near vertical incidence skywave (NVIS) radio links employed for data transmission is topical and fosters better understanding signal propagation as well as developing state-of-the-art cognitive radio systems. In this regard, the paper presents the findings of the research into the application of a noise-like phase-shift keying (PSK) signal for vertical sounding of NVIS radio links. There are presented the developed algorithms for processing the PSK signal to measure the scattering function and its parameters (signal-to-noise ratio, delay spread and Doppler spread) for multiple communication channels in the high frequency (HF) band.

"An objective method for combining multiple subjective data sets
International recommendations for subjective video quality assessment (e.g., ITU-R BT.500-11) include specifications for how to perform many different types of subjective tests. In addition to displaying the video sequences in different ways, subjective tests also have different rating scales, different words associated with these scales, and many other test variables that change from one laboratory to another (e.g., viewer expertise and criticality, cultural differences, physical test environments). Thus, it is very difficult to directly compare or combine results from two or more subjective experiments. The ability to compare and combine results from multiple subjective experiments would greatly benefit developers and users of video technology since standardized subjective data bases could be expanded upon to include new source material and past measurement results could be related to newer measurement results. This paper presents a subjective method and an objective method for combining multiple subjective data sets. The subjective method utilizes a large meta-test with selected video clips from each subjective data set. The objective method utilizes the functional relationships between objective video quality metrics (extracted from the video sequences) and corresponding subjective mean opinion scores (MOSs). The objective mapping algorithm, called the iterated nested least-squares algorithm (INLSA), relates two or more independent data sets that are themselves correlated with some common intermediate variables (i.e, the objective video quality metrics). We demonstrate that the objective method can be used as an effective substitute for the expensive and time consuming subjective meta-test.",0,0,0
"Environmental Exposure Mixtures: Questions and Methods to Address Them
Purpose of This ReviewThis review provides a summary of statistical approaches that researchers can use to study environmental exposure mixtures. Two primary considerations are the form of the research question and the statistical tools best suited to address that question. Because the choice of statistical tools is not rigid, we make recommendations about when each tool may be most useful.Recent FindingsWhen dimensionality is relatively low, some statistical tools yield easily interpretable estimates of effect (e.g., risk ratio, odds ratio) or intervention impacts. When dimensionality increases, it is often necessary to compromise this interpretablity in favor of identifying interesting statistical signals from noise; this requires applying statistical tools that are oriented more heavily towards dimension reduction via shrinkage and/or variable selection.SummaryThe study of complex exposure mixtures has prompted development of novel statistical methods. We suggest that further validation work would aid practicing researchers in choosing among existing and emerging statistical tools for studying exposure mixtures.",0,0,0

"Virtual Calibration Method for Diesel Engine by Software in The Loop Techniques
The calibration of the engine control unit is increased for the development of the whole automotive system. The aim is to calibrate the electronic engine control to match the decreasing emission requirements and increasing fuel economy demands. The reduction of the number of tests on vehicles represents one of the most important requirements for increasing efficiency of the engine calibration process. However, the definition of the design of experiment is not straightforward because the data is not known beforehand, so it is difficult to process and analyse this data to achieve a globally valid model. To reduce time effort and costs the virtual calibration can be a valid solution. This procedure is called software in the loop (SIL) calibration able to develop a process to systematically identify the optimal balance of engine performance, emissions and fuel economy. In this work, a virtual calibration methodology is presented by using a two-stage model to get minimum exhaust emissions of a diesel engine. The data used are from a GT-Power model of a 3L supercharged diesel engine. The model is able to calculate the engine emissions for different engine parameters (such as the start of injection, EGR fraction and rail pressure) and from optimisation process, new injection start maps that reduce pollutant emissions are created.",0,1,1
"Data-driven control of micro-climate in buildings; an event-triggered reinforcement learning approach
Abstract Smart buildings have great potential for shaping an energy-efficient, sustainable, and more economic future for our planet as buildings account for approximately 40% of the global energy consumption. Future of the smart buildings lies in using sensory data for adaptive decision making and control that is currently gloomed by the key challenge of learning a good control policy in a short period of time in an online and continuing fashion. To tackle this challenge, an event-triggered – as opposed to classic time-triggered – paradigm, is proposed in which learning and control decisions are made when events occur and enough information is collected. Events are characterized by certain design conditions and they occur when the conditions are met, for instance, when a certain state threshold is reached. By systematically adjusting the time of learning and control decisions, the proposed framework can potentially reduce the variance in learning, and consequently, improve the control process. We formulate the micro-climate control problem based on semi-Markov decision processes that allow for variable-time state transitions and decision making. Using extended policy gradient theorems and temporal difference methods in a reinforcement learning set-up, we propose two learning algorithms for event-triggered control of micro-climate in buildings. We show the efficacy of our proposed approach via designing a smart learning thermostat that simultaneously optimizes energy consumption and occupants’ comfort in a test building.",1,1,1
"Research on Early Fault Diagnosis of Gear Box Based on LMD and Chaotic Oscillator
In order to realize the fault diagnosis of gear box, an early fault diagnosis method of gear box based on LMD and chaotic oscillator was proposed to solve the problem that the fault characteristic signals of gear vibration signal were weak and difficult to be extracted under the influence of strong noise and harmonics. Firstly, the collected original vibration signals of gear fault were decomposed into multiple single-component FREQUENCY modulated amplitude modulated signals (PF) by LMD. Then, PF components were screened out by observing the spectrum, and the signals were reconstructed to form a new signal with obvious fault characteristic information. Finally, the weak signal detection method of Duffing chaotic oscillator was used to detect the existence of side frequency band in the reconstructed signal, observe the phase plane trajectory diagram, and identify the gear fault characteristics. Through the gear fault simulation and experimental analysis, verified the feasibility of this method in the early gearbox fault diagnosis and effectiveness, and the results show that the LMD and chaotic oscillator based early gearbox gear fault diagnosis methods can effectively judge the existence of gearbox fault gear, and compared with envelope spectrum analysis, the sensitivity significantly higher than the envelope spectrum analysis of the algorithm.",0,0,1
"Integrated Steering and Differential Braking for Emergency Collision Avoidance in Autonomous Vehicles
Controlling the lateral dynamics of an autonomous vehicle confronting a sudden obstacle requires optimal use of tires’ force capacities. In these situations, autonomous steering may not be able to respond fast enough to prevent collision or instability. This paper presents an integrated controller for autonomous vehicles, capable of suitably reacting to emergency situations when a sudden obstacle appears on the road. The proposed controller employs differential braking conservatively when needed, to produce an additional yaw moment, thereby improving a vehicle’s lateral agility and responsiveness without endangering vehicle stability. A longitudinal controller is also designed to track a desired longitudinal velocity. Model predictive control (MPC) method is used for developing a combined path planning and tracking controller with a hierarchical structure that prioritizes (1) collision avoidance, (2) vehicle stability, and (3) path tracking. The effectiveness of the proposed integrated MPC controller is evaluated by simulating an experimentally validated CarSim model to demonstrate the controller’s capability in preventing instability and collisions.",0,0,1
"Coordination of OLTC and Smart Inverters for Optimal Voltage Regulation of Unbalanced Distribution Networks
Abstract Photovoltaic (PV) smart inverters can improve the voltage profile of distribution networks. A multi-objective optimization framework for coordination of reactive power injection of smart inverters and tap operations of on-load tap changers (OLTCs) for multi-phase unbalanced distribution systems is proposed. The optimization objective is to minimize voltage deviations and the number of tap operations simultaneously. A novel linearization method is proposed to linearize power flow equations and to convexify the problem, which guarantees convergence of the optimization and less computation costs. The optimization is modeled and solved using mixed-integer linear programming (MILP). The proposed method is validated against conventional rule-based autonomous voltage regulation (AVR) on the highly-unbalanced modified IEEE 37 bus test system and a large California utility feeder. Simulation results show that the proposed method accurately estimates feeder voltage, significantly reduces voltage deviations, mitigates over-voltage problems, and reduces voltage unbalance while eliminating unnecessary tap operations. The robustness of the method is validated against various levels of forecast error. The computational efficiency and scalability of the proposed approach are also demonstrated through the simulations on the large utility feeder.",0,0,1
"The Order Fulfillment Process
Order fulfillment is a key process in managing the supply chain. It is the customers' orders that put the supply chain in motion, and filling them efficiently and effectively is the first step in providing customer service. However, the order fulfillment process involves more than just filling orders. It is about designing a network and a process that permits a firm to meet customer requests while minimizing the total delivered cost. This involves more than logistics, and it needs to be implemented cross‐functionally and with the coordination of key suppliers and customers. In this paper the order fulfillment process is described in detail to show how it can be implemented within a company, and managed across firms in the supply chain.

"A Survey on Echo Chambers on Social Media: Description, Detection and Mitigation
Echo chambers on social media are a significant problem that can elicit a number of negative consequences, most recently affecting the response to COVID-19. Echo chambers promote conspiracy theories about the virus and are found to be linked to vaccine hesitancy, less compliance with mask mandates, and the practice of social distancing. Moreover, the problem of echo chambers is connected to other pertinent issues like political polarization and the spread of misinformation. An echo chamber is defined as a network of users in which users only interact with opinions that support their pre-existing beliefs and opinions, and they exclude and discredit other viewpoints. This survey aims to examine the echo chamber phenomenon on social media from a social computing perspective and provide a blueprint for possible solutions. We survey the related literature to understand the attributes of echo chambers and how they affect the individual and society at large. Additionally, we show the mechanisms, both algorithmic and psychological, that lead to the formation of echo chambers. These mechanisms could be manifested in two forms: (1) the bias of social media's recommender systems and (2) internal biases such as confirmation bias and homophily. While it is immensely challenging to mitigate internal biases, there has been great efforts seeking to mitigate the bias of recommender systems. These recommender systems take advantage of our own biases to personalize content recommendations to keep us engaged in order to watch more ads. Therefore, we further investigate different computational approaches for echo chamber detection and prevention, mainly based around recommender systems.",1,0,0
"Assessment of non-technical barriers for widespread adoption of Building Integrated Photovoltaic system (BIPV) in Malaysian urban residential sector
Building Integrated Photovoltaic BIPV technology (BIPV) is a mature and proven technology, yet it still encounters many barriers for penetration into public realm especially residential sector. Malaysian residential sector consumed approximately 19% of the total energy usage of the country (R. Saidur et al., 2007). As the process of urbanization is going at a rapid pace in a developing country like Malaysia, this percentage is expected to rise rapidly in the near future. Therefore, it is critical to identify these barriers in the Malaysian urban residential sector, analyse them and draw strategies for the penetration of BIPV into Malaysian urban residential sector. One important aspects in identification of these barriers is to understand the public awareness and perception of this emerging renewable technology in Malaysia. According to Farhar, B.C.,(1996), perceptions are important because what people believe to be real is real in its consequences. She also added that perceptions and preferences are themselves facts that describe the social world in which people operate. Farhar, B.C.,(1996), also pointed out that people perceptions and preferences about energy and the environment are influenced by objectively factual information. Due to great diversity of barriers to finding and implementing solutions to this emerging renewable technology like BIPV, it will be useful to group these barriers in some way which should not seen as rigid, but as a framework for identification and analysis. In gauging this understanding, a Trudgill (1990) framework for analysis will be deployed as a basis to identify areas of concern and investigation concerning public response towards this new emerging renewable energy source. Trudgill (1990) framework for analysis consist of six major groups of barriers – agreement, knowledge, technological, economic, social and political – which will refer to collectively as the ‘AKTESP’ barriers. Upon identification of the non-technical barriers, this research will subsequently undertake to conduct a field survey in the Malaysian urban areas to assess these barriers. Based on the analysis of the field survey data, it will provide a realistic agenda for forming strategies and recommendations to solution of these barriers.",0,0,0
"Performance assessment of Synchronous Condensers vs Voltage Source Converters providing grid-forming functions
Having sufficient grid-forming sources is one of the necessary conditions to guarantee the stability in a power system hosting a very large share of inverter-based generation. The grid-forming function has been historically fulfilled by synchronous machines. However, with the appropriate control, it can also be provided by voltage source converters (VSC). This work presents a comparison between two technologies with grid-forming capability: the VSC with a grid-forming control coupled with an adequate energy storage system, and the synchronous condensers (SC). Both devices are compared regarding their inertial response, as well as their contribution to the system strength and short-circuit current for an equivalent capacity expressed in terms of apparent power and inertial reserve. Their behaviour following grid disturbances is assessed through time-domain simulations based on detailed electromagnetic transient (EMT) models. The results show that both devices achieve similar performance in the timescale of seconds. For shorter time-windows, however, they present a different behavior: the SC ensures a better stiffness in the first tens of ms following the disturbance, while the VSC offers a faster resynchronization.",0,0,1
"A Review of The Methanol Economy: The Fuel Cell Route
This review presents methanol as a potential renewable alternative to fossil fuels in the fight against climate change. It explores the renewable ways of obtaining methanol and its use in efficient energy systems for a net zero-emission carbon cycle, with a special focus on fuel cells. It investigates the different parts of the carbon cycle from a methanol and fuel cell perspective. In recent years, the potential for a methanol economy has been shown and there has been significant technological advancement of its renewable production and utilization. Even though its full adoption will require further development, it can be produced from renewable electricity and biomass or CO2 capture and can be used in several industrial sectors, which make it an excellent liquid electrofuel for the transition to a sustainable economy. By converting CO2 into liquid fuels, the harmful effects of CO2 emissions from existing industries that still rely on fossil fuels are reduced. The methanol can then be used both in the energy sector and the chemical industry, and become an all-around substitute for petroleum. The scope of this review is to put together the different aspects of methanol as an energy carrier of the future, with particular focus on its renewable production and its use in high-temperature polymer electrolyte fuel cells (HT-PEMFCs) via methanol steam reforming.",0,1,1

"OdoNet: Untethered Speed Aiding for Vehicle Navigation Without Hardware Wheeled Odometer
Odometer has been proven to significantly improve the robustness and accuracy of the Global Navigation Satellite System/Inertial Navigation System (GNSS/INS) integrated vehicle navigation in GNSS-denied environments. However, odometer is inaccessible in many applications, especially for aftermarket devices and smartphones. To apply forward speed aiding without hardware wheeled odometer, we propose OdoNet, an untethered one-dimensional Convolution Neural Network (CNN)-based pseudo-odometer model learning from a single Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU). Dedicated experiments have been conducted to verify the generalization capability and the precision of the OdoNet. The results indicate that the IMU individuality, the vehicle loads, and the road conditions have little impact on the robustness and precision of the OdoNet, while the IMU biases and the mounting angles may notably ruin the OdoNet. Hence, a data-cleaning procedure is adopted to effectively mitigate the impacts of the IMU biases and the mounting angles. Compared to the processing mode using only non-holonomic constraint (NHC), by employing the pseudo-odometer, the positioning error is reduced by around 68%, while the percentage is around 74% for the hardware wheeled odometer. In conclusion, the proposed OdoNet can be employed as an untethered pseudo-odometer for vehicle navigation.",0,1,1
"Advanced OFDM Receivers for Underwater Acoustic Communications
In underwater acoustic (UWA) communications, an emerging research area is the high data rate and robust transmission using multi-carrier modulation, such as orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (OFDM). However, difficulties in the OFDM communications include Doppler estimation/compensation, beamforming, and channel estimation/equalization. In this thesis, to overcome these difficulties, advanced low complexity OFDM receivers of high performance are developed. A novel low complexity Doppler estimation method based on computing multi-channel autocorrelation is proposed, which provides accurate Doppler estimates. In simulations and sea trials with guard-free OFDM signal transmission, this method outperforms conventional single-channel autocorrelation method, and shows a less complexity than the method based on computing the cross-ambiguity function between the received and pilot signals with a comparable performance. Space-time clustering in UWA channels is investigated, and a low complexity multi-antenna receiver including a beamformer that exploits this channel property is proposed. Various space-time processing techniques are investigated and compared, and the results show that the space-time clustering demonstrates the best performance. Direction of arrival (DOA) fluctuations in time-varying UWA channels are investigated, and a further developed beamforming technique with DOA tracking is proposed. In simulation and sea trials, this beamforming is compared with the beamforming without DOA tracking. The results show that the tracking beamforming demonstrates a better performance. For the channel estimation, two low complexity sparse recursive least squares adaptive filters, based on diagonal loading and homotopy, are presented. In two different UWA communication systems, the two filters are investigated and compared with various existing adaptive filters, and demonstrate better performance. For the simulations, the Waymark baseband UWA channel model is used, to simulate the virtual signal transmission in time-varying UWA channels. This model is modified from the previous computationally efficient Waymark passband model, improving the computational efficiency further.",0,1,0
"Geometric Adaptive Control With Neural Networks for a Quadrotor in Wind Fields
This article presents a geometric adaptive controller for a quadrotor unmanned aerial vehicle with artificial neural networks. It is assumed that the dynamics of a quadrotor is disturbed by the arbitrary, unstructured forces and moments caused by wind. To address this, the proposed control system is augmented with the multilayer neural networks, and the weights of the neural networks are adjusted online according to an adaptive law. By using the universal approximation theorem, it is shown that the effects of the unknown disturbances can be mitigated. More specifically, under the proposed control system, the tracking errors in the position and heading directions are uniformly ultimately bounded. These are developed directly on the special Euclidean group to avoid the complexities or singularities inherent to local parameterizations. The efficacy of the proposed control system is first illustrated by numerical examples. Then, several indoor flight experiments are presented to demonstrate that the proposed controller successfully rejects the effects of wind disturbances even for aggressive, agile maneuvers.",0,1,1

Data were obtained from 77 articles published from 1994 to 2009 in 35 journals. The articles were categorized according to their applicability into three basic sectors - textile production, apparel manufacture, and distribution/sales. They were further categorized into 16 subsectors based on their operational and management/control processes. A comprehensive list of categorized journal articles identified in this study provides insights and relevant references for both researchers and practitioners on the application of decision support and intelligent systems to various stages of a textile and apparel supply chain. In light of the developed classification framework, we identify gaps in extending the use of the decision support and artificial intelligent systems in the industry and suggest potential and applicable research areas for further consideration in this subject area.",0,1,0
"Dark Patterns after the GDPR: Scraping Consent Pop-ups and Demonstrating their Influence
New consent management platforms (CMPs) have been introduced to the web to conform with the EU's General Data Protection Regulation, particularly its requirements for consent when companies collect and process users' personal data. This work analyses how the most prevalent CMP designs affect people's consent choices. We scraped the designs of the five most popular CMPs on the top 10,000 websites in the UK (n=680). We found that dark patterns and implied consent are ubiquitous; only 11.8% meet our minimal requirements based on European law. Second, we conducted a field experiment with 40 participants to investigate how the eight most common designs affect consent choices. We found that notification style (banner or barrier) has no effect; removing the opt-out button from the first page increases consent by 22-23 percentage points; and providing more granular controls on the first page decreases consent by 8-20 percentage points. This study provides an empirical basis for the necessary regulatory action to enforce the GDPR, in particular the possibility of focusing on the centralised, third-party CMP services as an effective way to increase compliance.",0,1,0
"Stiffness modeling of industrial robots for deformation compensation in machining
In robotic machining applications, the precision of the robot is of great importance. In heavy machining process, the lower stiffness of industrial robots results in greater position errors than that of the CNC machine executing the same process.

Experimental results outline the potential of the model in machining application.",0,1,1
"Factors influencing operational energy performance and refurbishment of UK listed church buildings : towards a strategic management framework
The heritage building sector is recognised as a promising industry capable of reducing 
environmental impacts of its buildings. However, their current energy performance still remains 
low with insufficient research into the causes for their poor performance. Current research on 
heritage building’s energy performance is mainly concerned with investigating their thermal 
performance. Meanwhile, statutory conservation requirements for listed buildings remain a 
challenging constraint on their sustainable energy refurbishment options. There is, however, a gap 
in terms of specifically investigating their operational energy performance. Exacerbating this 
problem is the existence of operational islands between the industry’s stakeholders involved in 
reuse of listed church buildings (LCBs) projects. 
This study investigated critical factors perceived to be responsible for this problem from the 
perspectives of the stakeholders’ practices and influence on energy consumption in the reuse of 
LCBs. A sequential mixed-method research approach was adopted using soft system 
methodology as the main theoretical perspective. 
Findings identified four critical factors perceived to significantly influence energy consumption 
in the reuse of LCBs. These indicate that human ‘subsystem’ factors permeate the individual, 
institutional and system levels as both a trigger and the most critical factor constituting the biggest 
challenge to achieving sustainable reuse of LCBs. Results from the study highlight the need for a 
tool redirecting current practice to improve the operational performance of these buildings. The 
output from this study is the proposal of a strategic energy management framework which could 
contribute to the development of a body of theory relating to more sustainable heritage building 
conservation and asset management. 
An implication of this study is that a tool, such as this proposed strategic energy management 
framework could aid designers and facility managers to take informed decisions early in the 
design and operational practices; supporting them and other stakeholders in achieving 
environmental sustainability in the reuse of LCB projects. It concludes that if the critical factors 
are addressed appropriately, environmental impacts of LCBs could be minimised.",0,1,1
"Deformation-Aware Data-Driven Grasp Synthesis
Grasp synthesis for 3-D deformable objects remains a little-explored topic, most works aiming to minimize deformations. However, deformations are not necessarily harmful—humans are, for example, able to exploit deformations to generate new potential grasps. How to achieve that on a robot is though an open question. This letter proposes an approach that uses object stiffness information in addition to depth images for synthesizing high-quality grasps. We achieve this by incorporating object stiffness as an additional input to a state-of-the-art deep grasp planning network. We also curate a new synthetic dataset of grasps on objects of varying stiffness using the Isaac Gym simulator for training the network. We experimentally validate and compare our proposed approach against the case where we do not incorporate object stiffness on a total of 2800 grasps in simulation and 560 grasps on a real Franka Emika Panda. The experimental results show significant improvement in grasp success rate using the proposed approach on a wide range of objects with varying shapes, sizes, and stiffnesses. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the approach can generate different grasping strategies for different stiffness values. Together, the results clearly show the value of incorporating stiffness information when grasping objects of varying stiffness.

"Unsupervised Disaggregation of Water Heater Load from Smart Meter Data Processing
In the residential sector, electric water heaters are appliances with a relatively high power consumption and a significant thermal inertia, which is particularly suitable for Demand Response (DR) schemes. The success of efficient DR schemes via the control of water heaters presupposes an accurate estimate of their power demand at each instant. Although the load of water heaters is rarely directly measured, a large penetration of Smart Meters (SMs) in distribution grids enables to indirectly infer this information on a large scale via load disaggregation. For that purpose, a considerable number of Non-Intrusive Load Monitoring (NILM) approaches are suggested in the literature. However, they require data streams at a time resolution in the range of one second or higher, which is not realistic for standard SMs. Hence, this paper proposes an unsupervised approach to detect and disaggregate the load profile of water heaters from standard SM data with a time resolution in the minute range. Evaluated on multiple real loads with sub-metering, the proposed approach achieves a Normalized Mean Absolute Error (NMAE) lower than 2% and a precision generally higher than 92% with time resolutions between 5 and 15 minutes.",0,0,1
"An MPC Walking Framework with External Contact Forces
In this work, we present an extension to a linear Model Predictive Control (MPC) scheme that plans external contact forces for the robot when given multiple contact locations and their corresponding friction cone. To this end, we set up a two-step optimization problem. In the first optimization, we compute the Center of Mass (CoM) trajectory, foot step locations, and introduce slack variables to account for violating the imposed constraints on the Zero Moment Point (ZMP). We then use the slack variables to trigger the second optimization, in which we calculate the optimal external force that compensates for the ZMP tracking error. This optimization considers multiple contacts positions within the environment by formulating the problem as a Mixed Integer Quadratic Program (MIQP) that can be solved at a speed between 100-300 Hz. Once contact is created, the MIQP reduces to a single Quadratic Program (QP) that can be solved in real-time (< 1kHz). Simulations show that the presented walking control scheme can withstand disturbances 2-3x larger with the additional force provided by a hand contact.",0,1,1
"A Comprehensive Overview of Electric Vehicle Charging using Renewable Energy
The integration of PV with the electric vehicle (EV) charging system has been on the rise due to several factors, namely continuous reduction in the price of PV modules, rapid growth in EV and concern over the effects of greenhouse gases. Over the years, numerous papers have been published on EV charging using the standard utility (grid) electrical supply; however, there seems to be an absence of a comprehensive overview using PV as one of the components for the charger. With the growing interest in this topic, it is timely to review, summarize and update all the related works on PV charging, and to present it as a single reference. For the benefit of a wider audience, the paper also includes the background of EV, as well as a brief description of PV systems. Some of the main features of battery management system (BMS) for EV battery are also presented. It is envisaged that the information gathered in this paper will be a valuable one–stop source of information for researchers working in this topic.The integration of PV with the electric vehicle (EV) charging system has been on the rise due to several factors, namely continuous reduction in the price of PV modules, rapid growth in EV and concern over the effects of greenhouse gases.

"Emotional Subtitles: A System and Potential Applications for Deaf and Hearing Impaired People
Many Deaf and Hearing Impaired people use subtitles to gain access to audio content on television and film presentations. Although subtitles tell the viewer what is being said they fail to communicate how it is being said. This “emotional gap” experienced by viewer’s highlights a significant drawback to current subtitling especially when used for learning by the Deaf. In this paper we introduce a system that demonstrates the presentation of subtitles that depict the emotions behind the words used on screen. The system also provides viewers with the ability to personalize and adapt their interaction with subtitles, so as to assist them in their learning. Using this system we hope to conduct a series of surveys looking at how people receive and use subtitles. In conducting this research we aim to gain a comprehensive understanding of the issues associated with emotional subtitling and to provide guidance for future producers of subtitled materials.",0,0,0
"Blockchain: case studies in food supply chain visibility

Purpose
This paper aims to investigate how blockchain has moved beyond cryptocurrencies and is being deployed to enhance visibility and trust in supply chains, their limitations and potential impact.


Design/methodology/approach
Qualitative analysis are undertaken via case studies drawn from food companies using semi-structured interviews.


Findings
Blockchain is demonstrated as an enabler of visibility in supply chains. Applications at scale are most likely for products where the end consumer is prepared to pay the premium currently required to fund the technology, e.g. baby food. Challenges remain in four areas: trust of the technology, human error and fraud at the boundaries, governance, consumer data access and willingness to pay.


Research limitations/implications
The paper shows that blockchain can be utilised as part of a system generating visibility and trust in supply chains. Research directs academic attention to issues that remain to be addressed. The challenges pertaining to the technology itself we believe to be generalisable; those specific to the food industry may not hold elsewhere.


Practical implications
From live case studies, we provide empirical evidence that blockchain provides visibility of exchanges and reliable data in fully digitised supply chains. This provides provenance and guards against counterfeit goods. However, firms will need to work to gain consumer buy-in for the technology following repeated past claims of trustworthiness.


Originality/value
This paper provides primary evidence from blockchain use cases “in the wild”. The exploratory case studies examine application of blockchain for supply chain visibility.

"When Will AI Exceed Human Performance? Evidence from AI Experts

 
 
 
Advances in artificial intelligence (AI) will transform modern life by reshaping transportation, health, science, finance, and the military. To adapt public policy, we need to better anticipate these advances. Here we report the results from a large survey of machine learning researchers on their beliefs about progress in AI. Researchers predict AI will outperform humans in many activities in the next ten years, such as translating languages (by 2024), writing high-school essays (by 2026), driving a truck (by 2027), working in retail (by 2031), writing a bestselling book (by 2049), and working as a surgeon (by 2053). Researchers believe there is a 50% chance of AI outperforming humans in all tasks in 45 years and of automating all human jobs in 120 years, with Asian respondents expecting these dates much sooner than North Americans. These results will inform discussion amongst researchers and policymakers about anticipating and managing trends in AI.

"Explanations in Autonomous Driving: A Survey
The automotive industry has witnessed an increasing level of development in the past decades; from manufacturing manually operated vehicles to manufacturing vehicles with a high level of automation. With the recent developments in Artificial Intelligence (AI), automotive companies now employ blackbox AI models to enable vehicles to perceive their environment and make driving decisions with little or no input from a human. With the hope to deploy autonomous vehicles (AV) on a commercial scale, the acceptance of AV by society becomes paramount and may largely depend on their degree of transparency, trustworthiness, and compliance with regulations. The assessment of the compliance of AVs to these acceptance requirements can be facilitated through the provision of explanations for AVs’ behaviour. Explainability is therefore seen as an important requirement for AVs. AVs should be able to explain what they have ‘seen’, done, and might do in environments in which they operate. In this paper, we provide a comprehensive survey of the existing work in explainable autonomous driving. First, we open by providing a motivation for explanations by highlighting the importance of transparency, accountability, and trust in AVs; and examining existing regulations and standards related to AVs. Second, we identify and categorise the different stakeholders involved in the development, use, and regulation of AVs and elicit their AV explanation requirements. Third, we provide a rigorous review of previous work on explanations for the different AV operations (i.e., perception, localisation, planning, vehicle control, and system management). Finally, we discuss pertinent challenges and provide recommendations including a conceptual framework for AV explainability. This survey aims to provide the fundamental knowledge required of researchers who are interested in explanation provisions in autonomous driving.",0,0,0
"Resistance to crowdfunding among entrepreneurs: An impression management perspective
Entrepreneurs' resistance to crowdfunding is considered in terms of impression management.A case study of entrepreneurs in the Republic of Ireland is performed.Fears around disclosure, visible failure, and projecting desperation are identified.A refined model of entrepreneurs' resistance to crowdfunding is presented.The complex and dialectical strategic implications of crowdfunding are discussed. Crowdfunding has been a topic of much excitement for scholars of entrepreneurialism. Onlookers and early adopters have noted the new strategies afforded when funding bottlenecks can be bypassed and members of the public can be engaged early in development. Yet if crowdfunding is to prove truly disruptive for entrepreneurs then greater efforts must be made to understand non-adopters. This study models entrepreneurs' resistance to crowdfunding using an impression management perspective. A case study of 20 entrepreneurs suggests that resistance is influenced by entrepreneurs' fear of disclosure, fear of visible failure, and fear of projecting desperation.",0,0,0
"Column generation for the discrete Unit Commitment problem with min-stop ramping constraints
The discrete unit commitment problem with min-stop ramping constraints optimizes the daily production of thermal power plants (coal, gas, fuel units). For this problem, compact Integer Linear Programming (ILP) formulations have been designed to solve exactly small instances and heuristically real-size instances. This paper investigates whether Dantzig-Wolfe reformulation allows to improve the previous exact method and matheuristics. The extended ILP formulation is presented with the column generation algorithm to solve its linear relaxation. The experimental results show that the Dantzig-Wolfe reformulation does not improve the quality of the linear relaxation of the tightest compact ILP formulations. Computational experiments suggest also a conjecture which would explain such result: the compact ILP formulation of min-stop ramping constraints would be tight. Such results validate the quality of the exact methods and matheuristics based on compact ILP formulations previously designed.",0,1,0
"Azimuth Null-Reduced Radiation Pattern, Ultralow Profile, Dual-Wideband and Low Passive Intermodulation Ceiling Mount Antenna for Long Term Evolution Application
An ultralow profile, dual-wideband and low passive intermodulation (PIM) in-building ceiling-mount antenna for long term evolution (LTE) distributed antenna system (DAS) application is presented. The proposed antenna was designed based on asymmetrical dipole concept having a ground plane with an inclined feeding edge to achieve wideband characteristic and reduced null radiation pattern in the azimuth plane when oriented horizontally. Various dipole and monopole design approaches are presented to give an insight into the typical elevation dipole-liked radiation pattern in the azimuth plane when oriented horizontally to achieve ultralow profile feature. The proposed antenna improves from a simple rectangular monopole to a newly innovated design with off-center feeding location and radiating elements by implementing new design features, e.g. having variation between edges of the radiator and ground plane, slots within monopole radiator and ground plane and inclination of the feeding edge of the ground plane. These additional features enable the proposed design to have a good compromise between the azimuth plane radiation pattern and impedance matching. A production-quality prototype was fabricated to ensure the best PIM performance is achievable. The performance of the prototype was measured. The antenna offers dual-wideband characteristic covering most of the LTE frequency ranges of 698-960MHz and 1350-3800MHz. The passive intermodulation levels that measured for both 700MHz and 1920MHz bands are better than −150 dBc at carrier input of $2\times20$ Watts.",0,0,0

"Development and Optimization of an Unstructured KineticModel for Sodium Gluconate Fermentation Process
This study proposed a modified unstructured kinetic model for sodium gluconate fermentation by Aspergillus niger. Four specific growth rate equations (Monod, Tessier, Contois, and logistic) were considered in the biomass growth equation. The growth, instantaneous biomass concentration, instantaneous product, and substrate concentration were considered in the equations of product formation and substrate consumption. Option parameters were introduced to determine the form of the unstructured model. A double-nested optimization strategy was proposed to optimize the option and kinetic parameters. The proposed unstructured kinetic model based on the estimated optimal parameters efficiently simulated sodium gluconate fermentation. The obtained option parameters of the kinetic model indicated that the Monod equation-based unstructured model displayed better performance than the three other specific growth rate equation-based kinetic models.",0,0,1
"A Novel Fast Single Image Dehazing Algorithm Based on Artificial Multiexposure Image Fusion
Poor weather conditions, such as fog, haze, and mist, cause visibility degradation in captured images. Existing imaging devices lack the ability to effectively and efficiently mitigate the visibility degradation caused by poor weather conditions in real time. Image depth information is used to eliminate hazy effects by using existing physical model-based approaches. However, the imprecise depth information always affects dehazing performance. This article proposes an image fusion-based algorithm to enhance the performance and robustness of image dehazing. Based on a set of gamma-corrected underexposed images, pixelwise weight maps are constructed by analyzing both global and local exposedness to guide the fusion process. The spatial-dependence of luminance of the fused image is reduced, and its color saturation is balanced in the dehazing process. The performance of the proposed solution is confirmed in both theoretical analysis and comparative experiments.",0,0,1
"Emotions in Product Reviews--Empirics and Models
Online communities provide Internet users with means to overcome some information barriers and constraints, such as the difficulty to gather independent information about products and firms. Product review communities allow customers to share their opinions and emotions after the purchase of a product. We introduce a new dataset of product reviews from Amazon.com, with emotional information extracted by sentiment detection tools. Our statistical analysis of this data provides evidence for the existence of polemic reviews, as well as for the coexistence of positive and negative emotions inside reviews. We find a strong bias towards large values in the expression of positive emotions, while negative ones are more evenly distributed. We identified different time dynamics of the creation of reviews dependent on the presence of marketing and word of mouth effects. We define an agent-based model of the users of product review communities using a modeling framework for online emotions. This model can reproduce the scenarios of response to external influences, as well as some properties of the distributions of positive and negative emotions expressed in product reviews. This analysis and model can provide guidelines to manufacturers on how to increase customer satisfaction and how to measure the emotional impact of marketing campaigns through reviews data.",0,1,0
"Impact of Die Carrier on Reliability of Power LEDs
High power light emitting diodes (LEDs) suffer from heating effects that have a detrimental impact on the devices characteristics. The use of LED carriers with high thermal conductivity promotes extraction of heat away from the LED junction. Different materials can be used for this purpose, such as alumina, aluminium nitride, and silicon. Diamond has also been gaining momentum for demanding heat management applications. In order to evaluate the impact of the carrier material on the reliability of the devices, the junction temperature of Cree white XLamp XB-D LEDs was obtained with Ansys for various carriers and different LED current levels. The impact of the junction temperature on the LED’s lifetime, emission intensity, footprint, and wavelength stability was then evaluated for each carrier based on the datasheet of the devices. The results provide additional knowledge regarding the impact of the carrier on the performance of the LED.",0,1,1
"A novel 2-dimensional electric field sensor based on in-plane micro rotary actuator
This paper, for the first time, proposes a 2-dimensional electric field sensor based on in-plane micro rotary actuator. Compared to the existent electric field micro sensors, which can only detect an axial direction electric field, this sensor is capable of 2-dimensional electric field sensing. In the design of the micro sensor, the combination of angular comb-drives and serpentine springs can bring the advantage of achieving large in-plane rotation, which enlarges the vibration amplitudes and results in more induced charges. Moreover, both push-pull electrostatic actuation method and differential sensing electrodes are adopted to expand the vibration magnitudes and reduce the impact of common mode interference. Experimental results show that this sensor has good linearity of 1.21% in a wide range, and this sensor can detect the X and Y component of electric field with measurement errors better than 8%.",0,0,1

Abstract The time domain behavior of dynamic surface tension was experimentally observed for submicellar aqueous solutions (2 × 10 −3 and 4 × 10 −3 mole m −3 ) of the surfactant dimethyldodecylphosphine oxide. The frequency domain behavior was calculated. by mapping one domain into the other with the Fourier transform operator. Two consecutive numerical processing runs were performed with different discretizations of the same input signal (0.1− and 3.0-sec time intervals between readings, respectively). By choosing an appropriate part of the output array from each run, satisfactorily accurate spectra of surface viscoelastic modulus were obtained. Values of parameters, determined from the reported spectra on the basis of the Lucassen theory, compare favorably with those given in the literature (obtained from equilibrium data).",0,0,1
"Runoff Curve Number: Has It Reached Maturity?
The conceptual and empirical foundations of the runoff curve number method are reviewed. The method is a conceptual model of hydrologic abstraction of storm rainfall. Its objective is to estimate direct runoff depth from storm rainfall depth, based on a parameter referred to as the “curve number.” The method does not take into account the spatial and temporal variability of infiltration and other abstractive losses; rather, it aggregates them into a calculation of the total depth loss for a given storm event and drainage area. The method describes average trends, which precludes it from being perfectly predictive. The observed variability in curve numbers, beyond that which can be attributed to soil type, land use/treatment, and surface condition, is embodied in the concept of antecedent condition. The method is widely used in the United States and other countries.

"Analysis of operator support method based on intelligent dynamic interlock in lead-cooled fast reactor simulator
Abstract In nuclear systems, operators have to carry out corrective actions when abnormal situations occur. However, operators might make mistakes under pressure. In order to avoid serious consequences of the human errors, a new method for operators support based on intelligent dynamic interlock was proposed. The new method based on full digital instrumentation and control system, contains real-time alarm analysis process, decision support process and automatic safety interlock process. Once abnormal conditions occur, necessary safety interlock parameter based on analysis of real-time alarm and decision support process can be loaded into human-machine interfaces and controllers automatically, and avoid human errors effectively. Furthermore, the new method can make recommendations for further use and development of this technique in nuclear power plant or fusion research reactor.",0,1,1
"Dynamical theory for the battery's electromotive force.
We propose a dynamical theory of how the chemical energy stored in a battery generates the electromotive force (emf). In this picture, the battery's half-cell acts as an engine, cyclically extracting work from its underlying chemical disequilibrium. We show that the double layer at the electrode-electrolyte interface can exhibit a rapid self-oscillation that pumps an electric current, thus accounting for the persistent conversion of chemical energy into electrical work equal to the emf times the separated charge. We suggest a connection between this mechanism and the slow self-oscillations observed in various electrochemical cells, including batteries, as well as the enhancement of the current observed when ultrasound is applied to the half-cell. Finally, we propose more direct experimental tests of the predictions of this dynamical theory.",0,0,1
"Inertia Pricing in Stochastic Electricity Markets
—Maintaining the stability of renewable-dominant power systems requires the procurement of virtual inertia services from non-synchronous resources (e.g., batteries, wind turbines) in addition to inertia traditionally provided by synchronous resources (e.g., thermal generators). However, the pricing of inertia provision has not been studied in a stochastic electricity market, where the uncertainty characteristics of renewable energy sources (RES) are considered. To ﬁll in this research gap, this paper formulates a chance-constrained stochastic unit commitment model with inertia requirements and computes equilibrium energy, reserve and inertia prices using convex duality. Numerical experiments on an illustrative system and a modiﬁed IEEE 118-bus system show the performance of the proposed pricing mechanism. By allowing new virtual inertia providers to contribute to system inertia requirements, the total operating cost reduces. Moreover, the proposed stochastic electricity market internalizes RES uncertainty, which yields additional cost reductions by co-optimizing energy, reserve and inertia procurement.",0,0,1
"BUILDING EXTRACTION FROM HIGH RESOLUTION SATELLITE IMAGES USING HOUGH TRANSFORM
An approach was developed for the automatic extraction of the rectangular and circular shaped buildings from high resolution satellite imagery using Hough transform. First, the candidate building patches are detected from the imagery using the binary Support Vector Machines (SVM) classification technique. In addition to original image bands, the bands NDVI (Normalized Difference Vegetation Index), and nDSM (normalized Digital Surface Model) are also used in the classification. After detecting the building patches, their edges are detected using the Canny edge detection algorithm. The edge image is then converted into vector form using the Hough transform, which is a widely used technique for extracting the lines or curves of the objects. The vector lines and curves that represent the building edges are grouped based on perceptual groupings, and the building boundaries are constructed. The proposed approach was implemented using a program written in MATLAB® v. 7.1 programming environment. The experimental tests were carried out in the residential and industrial urban blocks selected in the Batikent district of Ankara, the capital city of Turkey using the pan-sharpened and panchromatic IKONOS images. The results obtained indicate that the proposed building extraction procedure based on SVM and Hough transform can be effectively used to extract the boundaries of the rectangular and circular shaped buildings. For the industrial buildings, we obtained quite satisfactory results with the average Building Detection Percentage (BDP) and the Quality Percentage (QP) values of 93.45% and 79.51%, respectively. For the residential rectangular buildings, the average BDP and QP values were computed to be 95.34% and 79.05%, respectively. For the residential circular buildings, the average BDP and QP values were found to be 78.74% and 66.81%, respectively.",0,1,1
"Case Study on Lean Manufacturing System Implementation in Batch Type Manufacturing Industry

"Predicting the research performance of early career scientists
This paper examines how early career-related factors can predict the future research performance of computer and information scientists. Although a few bibliometric studies have previously investigated multiple factors relating to early career scientists that significantly predict their future research performance, there have been limited studies on early career-related factors affecting scientists in the fields of information science and computer science. This study analyzes 4102 scientists whose publishing careers started in the same year. The criteria used to quantify future research performance of the target scientists included the number of publications and citation counts of publications in a 4-year citation window to indicate future research productivity and research impact, respectively. These criteria were regressed on 13 early career-related factors. The results showed that these factors accounted for about 27% and 23% of the future productivity of the target scientists in terms of journal articles and conference papers, respectively; these 13 factors were also responsible for 19% of the future impact of target scientists’ journal articles and 19% of the future impact of their conference papers. The factor that most contributed to explaining the future research performance (i.e. publication numbers) and future research impact (i.e. citation counts of publications) was the number of publications (both journal articles and conference papers) produced by the target scientists in their early career years.",0,1,0

In December 2019, the 3GPP defined the road-map for Release-17, which includes new features on the operation of New Radio (NR) in millimeter-wave bands with highly directional communications systems, i.e., up to 52.6 GHz. In this paper, a system-level simulation based study on the coexistence of NR-based access to unlicensed spectrum (NR-U) and an IEEE technology, i.e., 802.11ad Wireless Gigabit (WiGig), at 60 GHz bands is conducted. For NR-U, an extension of NR Release-15 based model is used such that the 60 GHz regulatory requirements are satisfied. First, the design and capabilities of the developed open source ns-3 based simulator are presented and then end-to-end performance results of coexistence with different channel access mechanisms for NR-U in a 3GPP indoor scenario are discussed. It is shown that NR-U with Listen-Before-Talk channel access mechanism does not have any adverse impact on WiGig performance in terms of throughput and latency, which demonstrates that NR-U design fulfills the fairness coexistence objective, i.e., NR-U and WiGig coexistence is proven to be feasible.",1,1,0
"A Note on the Kinematics of Rigid Molecules in Linear Flow Fields and Kinetic Theory for Biaxial Liquid Crystal Polymers
We present a systematic derivation of the extended Jeffery's orbit for rigid ellipsoidal and V-shaped polymer molecules in linear incompressible viscous flows using a Lagrange multiplier's method based on a constraining force argument. It reproduces the well-known Jeffery's orbit for rotating ellipsoids. The method is simple and applicable to any rigid body immersed in a linear flow field so long as a discrete set of representative points on the rigid body can be identified that possess the same rotational degrees of freedom as the rigid body itself. The kinematics of a single V-shaped rigid polymer driven by a linear flow field are discussed, where steady states exist along with time-periodic states in limited varieties. Finally, we show how the kinematics of the rigid V-shaped polymer can be used in the derivation a kinetic theory for the solution of rigid biaxial liquid crystal polymers, where Brownian motion, excluded volume interaction and flow driven kinematics are included.",0,0,1
"Industrial Tourism: A Conceptual and Empirical Analysis
Industrial tourism involves visits by tourists to operational industrial sites where the core activity of the site is 'non-tourism' oriented. The study discusses the concept of industrial tourism within the context of tourism attraction theory, and tests empirically the extent to which visitors to industrial tourism attractions can be identified by using (a) a particular personality theory (Holland's 1985 theory of personality types), (b) demographics, and (c) past visitation. Prior to conducting a major household survey, two preliminary studies were conducted. One study considered the range and type of industrial tourism attractions in Australia, while the other considered the applicability of Holland's theory to career choice and to tourism choice behaviour. The major household study found that there were some significant associations between the respondents' Holland personality types, and their tourism behaviour, for some attractions and some measures of behaviour. The study found that industrial tourism attractions are perceived as being different to other types of tourism attraction and that Holland's theory may be a useful means of predicting tourism choice behaviour but that other measures, such as demographics and type and size of travel party, should also be taken into consideration. The implications of the findings are discussed in relation to the marketing and other aspects of the management of industrial tourism attractions.",0,0,0
"Impact of IEEE 802.11n/ac PHY/MAC High Throughput Enhancements over Transport/Application Layer Protocols - A Survey
Since the inception of Wireless Local Area Networks (WLANs) in the year 1997, it has tremendously grown in the last few years. IEEE 802.11 is popularly known as WLAN. To provide the last mile wireless broadband connectivity to users, IEEE 802.11 is enriched with IEEE 802.11a, IEEE 802.11b and IEEE 802.11g. More recently, IEEE 802.11n, IEEE 802.11ac and IEEE 802.11ad are introduced with enhancements to the physical (PHY) layer and medium access control (MAC) sublayer to provide much higher data rates and thus these amendments are called High Throughput WLANs (HT-WLANs). For both standards, PHY is enhanced with multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) antenna technologies, channel bonding, short guard intervals (SGI), enhanced modulation and coding schemes (MCS). At the same time, MAC layer overhead is reduced by introducing frame aggregation and block acknowledgement technologies. However, existing studies reveal that although PHY and MAC enhancements promise to improve physical data rate significantly, they yield negative impact over upper layer protocols -- mainly for reliable end-to-end transport/application layer protocols. As a consequence, a large number of schools have focused researches on HT-WLANs to improve the coordination among PHY/MAC and upper layer protocols and thus, boost up the performance benefit. In this survey, we discuss the impact of enhancements of PHY/MAC layer in HT-WLANs over transport/application layer protocols. list down different open challenges that can be explored for the development of next generation HT-WLAN technologies.",0,0,0

"Monolayer MoS2 Strained to 1.3% With a Microelectromechanical System
We report on a modified transfer technique for atomically thin materials integrated into microelectromechanical systems (MEMS) for studying strain physics and creating strain-based devices. Our method tolerates the non-planar structures and fragility of MEMS while still providing precise positioning and crack-free transfer of flakes. Furthermore, our method used the transfer polymer to anchor the 2D crystal to the MEMS, which reduces the fabrication time and increases the yield, and allowed us to exploit the strong mechanical coupling between the 2D crystal and polymer to strain the atomically thin system. We successfully strained single atomic layers of molybdenum disulfide (MoS2) with MEMS devices for the first time and achieved greater than 1.3% strain, marking a major milestone for incorporating 2D materials with MEMS. We used the established strain response of MoS2 Raman and photoluminescence spectra to deduce the strain in our crystals and provide a consistency check. We found good comparison between our experiment and the literature. [2018-0144]",0,1,1
"Human-Centered Artificial Intelligence: Three Fresh Ideas
Human-Centered AI (HCAI) is a promising direction for designing AI systems that support human self-efficacy, promote creativity, clarify responsibility, and facilitate social participation. These human aspirations also encourage consideration of privacy, security, environmental protection, social justice, and human rights. This commentary reverses the current emphasis on algorithms and AI methods, by putting humans at the center of systems design thinking, in effect, a second Copernican Revolution. It offers three ideas: (1) a two-dimensional HCAI framework, which shows how it is possible to have both high levels of human control AND high levels of automation, (2) a shift from emulating humans to empowering people with a plea to shift language, imagery, and metaphors away from portrayals of intelligent autonomous teammates towards descriptions of powerful tool-like appliances and tele-operated devices, and (3) a three-level governance structure that describes how software engineering teams can develop more reliable systems, how managers can emphasize a safety culture across an organization, and how industry-wide certification can promote trustworthy HCAI systems. These ideas will be challenged by some, refined by others, extended to accommodate new technologies, and validated with quantitative and qualitative research. They offer a reframe -a chance to restart design discussions for products and services -which could bring greater benefits to individuals, families, communities, businesses, and society.",0,1,0
"What motivates customers to participate in social commerce? The impact of technological environments and virtual customer experiences
A research model is proposed to examine the factors that influence participation behavior of a customer in social commerce.Social commerce intention is determined by customers' virtual experiences, namely, social support, social presence and flow.Customers' virtual experiences are influenced by perceived interactivity, personalization and sociability features of the social commerce environment.The results of the model tests using Renren and SinaWeibo samples are significantly different. Social commerce, as a relatively new phenomenon, has attracted little research attention. This study aims to provide initial insights into the dynamics of customer participation in social commerce. Based on the stimulus-organism-response paradigm, this study develops a model to investigate the effects of technological features (perceived interactivity, perceived personalization and perceived sociability) of social commerce on customers' virtual experiences (social support, social presence and flow) and subsequently their participation intention. The results indicate that social commerce intention is determined by social support, social presence and flow experiences. These experiences, in turn, are influenced by perceived interactivity, personalization and sociability features.",0,1,0
"System Identification and Controller Design for Hydraulic Actuator
System Identification of Hydraulic Actuators is critical for analyzing their performance and designing a suitable Control System. Hydraulic actuators are extensively used in many applications, ranging from flight simulators, robotics, orthopaedic surgery, material testing, construction and many other industrial types of machinery. In the aviation industry, hydraulic actuators are currently being used in full flight simulators used for controlling the position and orientation of the motion platform. Every actuator has its own characteristics, therefore, the choice of excitation signals for System Identification must take into account the dynamics of the actuator under consideration. This work proposes the selection of excitation signals based on bandwidth of the hydraulic actuator. Validation of the proposed selection is done by performing system identification, obtaining a mathematical model and comparing it with a nonlinear hydraulic actuator model designed in Simscape. After validation, a nonlinear PID control has been tuned on the identified model and tested on the nonlinear model. Extensive simulations have been run and results show accurate mathematical modelling, as well as precise control has been achieved through the proposed methodology.

Abstract While autonomous multirotor micro aerial vehicles (MAVs) are uniquely well suited for certain types of missions benefiting from stationary flight capabilities, their more widespread usage still faces many hurdles, due in particular to their limited range and the difficulty of fully automating the deployment and retrieval. In this paper we address these issues by solving the problem of the automated landing of a quadcopter on a ground vehicle moving at relatively high speed. We present our system architecture, including the structure of our Kalman filter for the estimation of the relative position and velocity between the quadcopter and the landing pad, as well as our controller design for the full rendezvous and landing maneuvers. The system is experimentally validated by successfully landing in multiple trials a commercial quadcopter on the roof of a car moving at speeds of up to 50 km/h.",0,1,1

"Ball catching with omni-directional wheeled mobile robot and active stereo vision
This paper considers the design and implementation of a visual servo system for catching a flying ball using an active stereo vision system, a static vision system, and an omni-directional wheeled mobile robot. These multi-camera vision systems are used to track the flying ball and guide the omni-directional mobile wheeled robot to catch it. The dynamic model of a flying ball and Kalman filter are used to mitigate measurement noise, estimate the position and velocity of the flying ball, and predict its future trajectory. The mathematical model of the omni-directional mobile robot is derived to facilitate the control design. Trajectory tracking control of the mobile robot is done by combining feedback linearization and proportional-integral-derivative (PID) control. Finally, the experimental setup is constructed, and control laws and image processing algorithms are implemented through digital signal processors. The effectiveness of the designed system is validated through experimental studies. The results show that the developed vision systems are able to track a flying ball and guide and navigate the robot to catch it.",0,0,1
"Development of bioplastics from a microalgae consortium from wastewater.
Nowadays, as the world population is in need of creating alternative materials that can replace conventional plastics, microalgae biomass may be identified as a viable source for producing more environmentally friendly materials. Scenedesmus sp and Desmodesmus sp are the main components (~80%) of a microalgae consortium (MC) that first has been used to remove Nitrogen and Phosphorus from wastewater. The potential to develop bioplastic materials from MC considering its relatively high protein content (~48%) has been assessed in the present manuscript, using as a reference a commercial biomass rich an Arthrospira specie (AM) also present in the studied consortium. Bioplastics were obtained through injection moulding of blends obtained after mixing with different amounts of glycerol, and eventually characterized using Dynamic Mechanical Thermal Analysis (DMTA), water immersion and tensile tests. All bioplastics displayed a glass transition temperature around 60 °C, showing a thermoplastic behavior which is less pronounced in the CM based bioplastics. This would imply a greater thermal resistance of bioplastics produced from the biomass harvested in wastewater. Moreover, these bioplastics showed a lower ability to absorb water when immersed, due to the lower deformability displayed in the tensile tests. The mechanical properties of all samples, independently of the nature of the biomass, were improved when the presence of the biomass was higher. Therefore, results here presented prove the potential of valorisation of microalgae consortia used in the effective treatment of wastewater through the development of bioplastic materials.",0,1,1
"A new formulation of the electric vehicle routing problem with time windows considering concave nonlinear charging function
Abstract: The electric vehicle routing problem with time window (EVRPTW) is an extension of the traditional vehicle routing problem with time window (VRPTW), where new features of electric vehicles are considered, such as limited battery capacities, lack of infrastructures, and long charging time. In this study, new technical formulations were presented for vehicle route selection and charging station visit, which reduces the formulation complexity without using duplicated dummy nodes or arcs. Besides, a new linearization method was developed that employs a set of secant lines to surrogate the concave nonlinear charging function with linear constraints. This method defines the charging time as a continuous variable and uses fewer variables than existing formulation in literature. A mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) model was developed for the EVRPTW and computational experiments on Solomon's VRPTW instances were conducted to verify the proposed model. The experimental results were compared with those obtained by traditional routing models, which showed that the proposed model can result in better EVs logistics schedules with higher charging time utilizations.",0,1,1

"Impact of Dynamic Line Rating on Dispatch Decisions and Integration of Variable RES Energy
Dynamic line rating (DLR) models the transmission capacity of overhead lines as a function of ambient conditions. It takes advantage of the physical thermal property of overhead line conductors, thus making DLR less conservative compared to the traditional worst-case oriented nominal line rating (NLR). Employing DLR brings potential benefits for grid integration of variable Renewable Energy Sources (RES), such as wind and solar energy. In this paper, we reproduce weather conditions from renewable feed-ins and local temperature records, and calculate DLR in accordance with the RES feed-in and load demand data step. Simulations with high time resolution, using a predictive dispatch optimization and the Power Node modeling framework, of a six-node benchmark power system loosely based on the German power system are performed for the current situation, using actual wind and PV feed-in data. The integration capability of DLR under high RES production shares is inspected through simulations with scaled-up RES profiles and reduced dispatchable generation capacity. The simulation result demonstrates a comparison between DLR and NLR in terms of reductions in RES generation curtailments and load shedding, while discussions on the practicality of adopting DLR in the current power system is given in the end.",0,1,1
"ANYmal - a highly mobile and dynamic quadrupedal robot
This paper introduces ANYmal, a quadrupedal robot that features outstanding mobility and dynamic motion capability.

"Stochastic Model Predictive Control for Building HVAC Systems: Complexity and Conservatism
This paper presents a stochastic model predictive control (SMPC) approach to building heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC) systems. The building HVAC system is modeled as a network of thermal zones controlled by a central air handling unit and local variable air volume boxes. In the first part of this paper, simplified nonlinear models are presented for thermal zones and HVAC system components. The uncertain load forecast in each thermal zone is modeled by finitely supported probability density functions (pdfs). These pdfs are initialized using historical data and updated as new data becomes available. In the second part of this paper, we present a SMPC design that minimizes expected energy cost and bounds the probability of thermal comfort violations. SMPC uses predictive knowledge of uncertain loads in each zone during the design stage. The complexity of a commercial building requires special handling of system nonlinearities and chance constraints to enable real-time implementation, minimize energy cost, and guarantee thermal comfort. This paper focuses on the tradeoff between computational tractability and conservatism of the resulting SMPC scheme. The proposed SMPC scheme is compared with alternative SMPC designs, and the effectiveness of the proposed approach is demonstrated by simulation and experimental tests.",0,0,1
"Fear of Failure and Entrepreneurship: A review and direction for future research
The impact of the experience of fear of failure on individual cognition and behaviour can be beneficial as well as detrimental. Despite this dualistic nature, in research on entrepreneurship, fear of failure is examined as only a barrier to entrepreneurial behaviour. A systematic review of the entrepreneurship literature on fear of failure published between 1994 and 2013 reveals a general lack of precision in the conceptualisation and operationalisation of this construct. Drawing on achievement motivation theories, the appraisal theory of emotions, and coping theories, we develop a deeper understanding of the fear of failure phenomena and identify the attributes relevant to studying fear of failure in entrepreneurship. We then address the conceptual issues related to fear of failure, and the role it may assume within the entrepreneurial process. We then propose an agenda for future research.",0,0,0
"Rethinking Grid-Forming and Grid-Following Inverters: The Duality Theory
Grid-forming and grid-following inverters are recognized as two main types of power electronic converters for integrating renewable energy resources into power systems. They hold certain similarities, but more differences, which makes their relationship quite subtle and ambiguous. In this article, a new perspective called duality is proposed to overcome this problem, which successfully unifies the grid interfacing characteristics and grid synchronization of them in a very symmetric and graceful form. As analyzed, the grid-forming and grid-following inverters are essentially dual to each other, which is further based on the duality of a) synchronization controllers: frequency droop control and phase-locked loop (PLL); b) grid-interfacing characteristics: current-following voltage-forming and voltagefollowing current-forming; c) swing characteristics: current-angle swing and voltage-angle swing; d) controllers: output impedance shaping and output admittance shaping; e) grid strength: stronggrid instability and weak-grid instability; etc. The detailed swing characteristics are also derived in dual form for both inverters, which reveals the dynamic interaction among grid strength, synchronization controllers, and inner-loop controllers, as well as their effects on stability. Typical cases, namely single-inverterinfinite-bus systems and multi-inverter power systems, are studied and simulated to validate the theoretical analysis.",0,1,1

"Scaling PDIA Solutions through Broad Agency, and Your Role
Many development challenges are complex, involving a lot of different agents and with unknown dimensions. Solutions to these challenges are often unknown, and contextually dependent. At the same time, there are political imperatives at play in many contexts which create pressure to ‘find the solution now...and then scale it up.’ Such pressure raises a question: how does a policy entrepreneur or reformer find a new solution and scale it up when dealing with complexity? This is the subject we address in the current paper, which is the fifth in a series on ‘how to’ do problem driven iterative adaptation (PDIA) (Andrews et al. 2015, 2016a, 2016b, 2016c). The paper focuses on building broad agency solutions in the process of identifying problems and finding and fitting contextually appropriate solutions. The broad agency is, in our opinion, a most effective mechanism to ensure scaling and dynamic sustainability in the change process. As with other working papers on this topic, the contents here do not offer all answers to those asking questions about how to do development effectively. It closes by reflecting on the importance of ‘you’ (the reader, and ostensibly part of a policy change or reform team somewhere) using this and the other ideas as heuristics to rethink and reorient how you work—but with your own signature on each idea.",0,0,0
"From Metallurgical-Grade to Solar-Grade Silicon: An Overview
The non-renewable nature of fossil fuels as an energy source means its future availability is a cause for concern. The world’s energy demand is ever increasing and there is a growing interest in finding alternative renewable, environmentally benign and cheap energy sources like solar energy. This has resulted in the shortage of silicon feedstock for the photovoltaic industry. This is mainly due to the non-availability of a dedicated solar silicon production and the growing demand for silicon feedstock. There has been tremendous research in a quest to develop methods for the production of solar-grade silicon in a cheap and environmentally friendly way. The metallurgical and chemical routes for the production of solar-grade silicon from metallurgical-grade silicon have evolved. The chemical methods are the most researched ones and they are mostly preferred than the metallurgical ones since the former are capable of producing silicon of higher purity. This review discusses some of the available methods so far for the production of solar-grade silicon using metallurgical-grade silicon as a starting material.",0,1,1

"Reinforcement learning for pursuit and evasion of microswimmers at low Reynolds number
ing away from specific mechanisms developed by aquatic organisms or deployed for robots, the problem of pursue-evasion in microswimmers guided by hydrodynamic cues poses substantial difficulties that are rooted in the physics of the ambient medium. At low Reynolds numbers, flow disturbances are generally weak and characterized by symmetries [12] that create ambiguities about the location of the signal source especially when it is distant from the receiver [2, 3, 8]. Moreover, hydrodynamics has dynamical effects, since the disturbances generated by one microswimmer alter the motion of the other. Which pursuit-evasion strategies can be devised in such dynamic, partially observable environments? How do they compare with strategies based on visual cues? Can hydrodynamics be exploited and how?

Aiming at the problem that traditional convolutional neural networks (CNN) based fault diagnosis methods cannot capture the temporal information of rolling bearings, a one-dimensional Vision Transformer with Multiscale Convolution Fusion (MCF-1DViT) is proposed in this paper. To automatically and effectively enrich multiscale features from the collected vibration signals, the multiscale convolution fusion (MCF) layer is designed to capture the fault features in multiple time scales. Then, the improved Vision Transformer architecture is introduced to learn long-term time-related information with Transformer, which can significantly improve the diagnosis accuracy and antinoise ability. Finally, experiments on a popular rolling bearing dataset are implemented to validate the proposed method. The results show that the proposed method can obtain superior diagnosis performance compared with the existing methods.",0,0,1
"Adaptive Robust Unit Commitment in Coordinated Electricity and Natural Gas System
Coordinated operation of electricity and natural gas networks provides an effective solution not only for the transition to a near-zero emission energy system but also for mitigating nature variability of renewable power generation (RPG), due to the operating flexibility of gas-fired power plants and advanced technologies of power-to-gas facilities. However, such coordination adds new challenges to the day-ahead unit commitment (UC) decision with the guarantee of gas flow feasibility. This paper proposes a two-stage adaptive robust UC model against RPG fluctuations, considering bidirectional energy transactions and the approximated gas dynamics. The proposed model is tackled by the column and constraint generation (C&CG) algorithm, where additional secondary cuts are designed to enhance its optimality and convergence. To guarantee the solution feasibility, a sequential convex procedure (SCP) is advised to solve the master problem. Additional improvements are provided to enhance the SCP performance. The results evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed robust UC model and validate the performance of the solution procedures.",0,0,1
"Fully-Automated Packaging Structure Recognition in Logistics Environments
Within a logistics supply chain, a large variety of transported goods need to be handled, recognized and checked at many different network points. Often, huge manual effort is involved in recognizing or verifying packet identity or packaging structure, for instance to check the delivery for completeness. We propose a method for complete automation of packaging structure recognition: Based on a single image, one or multiple transport units are localized and, for each of these transport units, the characteristics, the total number and the arrangement of its packaging units is recognized. Our algorithm is based on deep learning models, more precisely convolutional neural networks for instance segmentation in images, as well as computer vision methods and heuristic components. We use a custom data set of realistic logistics images for training and evaluation of our method. We show that the solution is capable of correctly recognizing the packaging structure in approximately 85% of our test cases, and even more (91%) when focusing on most common package types.",1,1,0
"Development Of Rapid Construction Technology For Liquified Natural Gas Storage Tanks Using Precast Concrete Panels as a Permanent Form
■ The results indicate that the proposed LNG storage tank construction method using precast concrete panels can reduce construction time by approximately six months without significantly affecting costs. The demand for natural gas, an energy resource that accounts for a large portion of global energy consumption, is steadily increasing worldwide. In most parts of the world, such as Europe and North America, land transport is possible and natural gas is supplied through pipelines. However, in areas such as Korea, Japan, and Taiwan, marine transportation is required and the volume of natural gas needs to be reduced to ⁄600 of its original value by liquefying it at temperatures below -160°C (-256°F) before it can be transported by sea. Once transported, the liquefied natural gas (LNG) needs to be stored in LNG tanks.

"Real-time simulation of parameter-dependent fluid flows through deep learning-based reduced order models
Simulating fluid flows in different virtual scenarios is of key importance in engineering applications. However, high-fidelity, full-order models relying, e.g., on the finite element method, are unaffordable whenever fluid flows must be simulated in almost real-time. Reduced order models (ROMs) relying, e.g., on proper orthogonal decomposition (POD) provide reliable approximations to parameter-dependent fluid dynamics problems in rapid times. However, they might require expensive hyper-reduction strategies for handling parameterized nonlinear terms, and enriched reduced spaces (or Petrov–Galerkin projections) if a mixed velocity–pressure formulation is considered, possibly hampering the evaluation of reliable solutions in real-time. Dealing with fluid–structure interactions entails even greater difficulties. The proposed deep learning (DL)-based ROMs overcome all these limitations by learning, in a nonintrusive way, both the nonlinear trial manifold and the reduced dynamics. To do so, they rely on deep neural networks, after performing a former dimensionality reduction through POD, enhancing their training times substantially. The resulting POD-DL-ROMs are shown to provide accurate results in almost real-time for the flow around a cylinder benchmark, the fluid–structure interaction between an elastic beam attached to a fixed, rigid block and a laminar incompressible flow, and the blood flow in a cerebral aneurysm.",0,1,1
"Online Security Assessment of Low-Inertia Power Systems: A Real-Time Frequency Stability Tool for the Australian South-West Interconnected System
In small/medium-sized isolated power networks with low rotational inertia and high penetration of renewables, generation/load contingency events may cause large frequency excursions, potentially leading to cascading failures and even blackouts. Therefore, it is crucial for system operators to be able to monitor the state of the network in real-time and predict the maximum possible frequency deviations at all times. This paper presents a real-time frequency stability (RTFS) tool developed by the Australian Energy Market Operator (AEMO) and operationalized in the control room for the South West Interconnected System (SWIS) to ensure that the available spinning reserve is sufficient and fast enough to arrest frequency excursions under any conditions, and particularly low-inertia ones. To reduce the computational burden and complexity of the different turbine-governor models, a simple first-order lag function with two adjustable variables has been used for each of the generator. These adjustable parameters, along with other key model parameters such as load damping and inertia, have been calibrated against actual frequency response using high-speed fault recorder data from historical events. As demonstrated in several case studies, the real-time tool has proven to be accurate at predicting the trajectory of system frequency after credible contingencies, thus suggesting that similar implementations could be carried out elsewhere while power systems worldwide progress towards lower inertia.",0,1,1
"Optimal scheduling of flexibility resources incorporating dynamic line rating
High penetration of intermittent renewable energy poses stringent flexibility requirement for power systems to mitigate uncertainties. An optimal scheduling model of flexibility resources from the generation and load sides is proposed. Flexibility from the generation side is mainly provided by thermal generators. Electric vehicles (EVs) can be a viable resource of flexibility from the load side. The deliverability of flexibility is constrained by transmission capacity, which can be reinforced by the dynamic line rating (DLR) technology. The proposed optimal scheduling model incorporates DLR to harness the potential of flexibility resources. Simulation results on the IEEE 14-bus test system verify the validity of the proposed model and the effectiveness of DLR in improving the deliverability of flexibility.",0,0,1

"A State of the Art Review of Modal-Based Damage Detection in Bridges: Development, Challenges, and Solutions
Traditionally, damage identification techniques in bridges have focused on monitoring changes to modal-based Damage Sensitive Features (DSFs) due to their direct relationship with structural stiffness and their spatial information content. However, their progression to real-world applications has not been without its challenges and shortcomings, mainly stemming from: (1) environmental and operational variations; (2) inefficient utilization of machine learning algorithms for damage detection; and (3) a general over-reliance on modal-based DSFs alone.

"Garment Avatars: Realistic Cloth Driving using Pattern Registration
Virtual telepresence is the future of online communication. Clothing is an essential part of a person’s identity and self-expression. Yet, ground truth data of registered clothes is currently unavailable in the required resolution and accuracy for training telepresence models for realistic cloth animation. Here, we propose an end-to-end pipeline for building drivable representa- tions for clothing. The core of our approach is a multi-view patterned cloth tracking algorithm capable of capturing deformations with high accuracy. We further rely on the high-quality data produced by our tracking method to build a garment avatar : an expressive and fully-drivable geometry model for a piece of clothing. The resulting model can be animated using a sparse set of views and produces highly realistic reconstructions which are faithful to the driving signals. We demonstrate the efficacy of our pipeline on a realistic virtual telepresence application, where a garment is being reconstructed from two views, and a user can pick and swap garment design as they wish. In addition, we show a challenging scenario when driven exclusively with body pose, our drivable garment avatar is capable of producing realistic cloth geometry of significantly higher quality than the state-of-the-art.",0,1,0
"Surface-Potential-Based Silicon Carbide Power MOSFET Model for Circuit Simulation
Transistor models have been playing a key role in designing efficient power converters. As the operating frequency of the converters becomes higher, transistor models need to represent physical device behavior accurately. This paper proposes a comprehensive surface-potential-based model of silicon carbide (SiC) power MOSFETs that realizes accurate circuit simulations. Whereas conventional simulation models are based on empirical formulas, the proposed model is constructed in a surface-potential-based framework by considering the physical structure and behavior of vertical power SiC MOSFETs. The proposed model represents both <italic>I–V</italic> and <italic>C–V</italic> characteristics from weak inversion to the high-power region. In addition, the proposed model calculates the channel mobility degradation due to SiC/SiO<inline-formula><tex-math notation=""LaTeX"">$_2$</tex-math></inline-formula> interface traps, which significantly affects the circuit performance. Through experiments using a commercial SiC power MOSFET, excellent agreements are obtained between measurement and simulation in <italic>I–V</italic> and <italic> C–V</italic> characteristics at various temperatures for wide power ranges up to 1 kW. The transient behavior of a double-pulse tester is also well reproduced within a timing error of 12.6 ns even under the high temperature.",0,1,1
"The fingerprints of misinformation: how deceptive content differs from reliable sources in terms of cognitive effort and appeal to emotions
Not all misinformation is created equal. It can adopt many different forms like conspiracy theories, fake news, junk science, or rumors among others. However, most of the existing research does not account for these differences. This paper explores the characteristics of misinformation content compared to factual news—the “fingerprints of misinformation”—using 92,112 news articles classified into several categories: clickbait, conspiracy theories, fake news, hate speech, junk science, and rumors. These misinformation categories are compared with factual news measuring the cognitive effort needed to process the content (grammar and lexical complexity) and its emotional evocation (sentiment analysis and appeal to morality). The results show that misinformation, on average, is easier to process in terms of cognitive effort (3% easier to read and 15% less lexically diverse) and more emotional (10 times more relying on negative sentiment and 37% more appealing to morality). This paper is a call for more fine-grained research since these results indicate that we should not treat all misinformation equally since there are significant differences among misinformation categories that are not considered in previous studies.",0,0,0
"Drift control for cornering maneuver of autonomous vehicles
Abstract Expert drivers have the ability to perform high side-slip angle maneuvers, like drifting, during racing to minimize lap time or avoid obstacles. Designing planning and control algorithms for autonomous drift maneuvers, however, is challenging because of the high lateral motion and nearly full saturation of rear tires. In this paper, the authors propose a complete path planning and motion control framework to plan and track a reference drift trajectory along a sharp bend in a track. The path planner divides the path horizon into three regions, finds a path using different planning sub-modules, and then concatenates the solutions to generate the reference trajectory. The controller then applies a mixed open-loop and closed-loop scheme to track the reference trajectory. We validate the planning and control algorithms in simulation using a high-fidelity model in Simulink/Carsim, and through experimentation using 1/10 scale Radio-Control (RC) vehicle.",0,0,1
"Maximum correntropy square-root cubature Kalman filter with application to SINS/GPS integrated systems.
For a nonlinear system, the cubature Kalman filter (CKF) and its square-root version are useful methods to solve the state estimation problems, and both can obtain good performance in Gaussian noises. However, their performances often degrade significantly in the face of non-Gaussian noises, particularly when the measurements are contaminated by some heavy-tailed impulsive noises. By utilizing the maximum correntropy criterion (MCC) to improve the robust performance instead of traditional minimum mean square error (MMSE) criterion, a new square-root nonlinear filter is proposed in this study, named as the maximum correntropy square-root cubature Kalman filter (MCSCKF). The new filter not only retains the advantage of square-root cubature Kalman filter (SCKF), but also exhibits robust performance against heavy-tailed non-Gaussian noises. A judgment condition that avoids numerical problem is also given. The results of two illustrative examples, especially the SINS/GPS integrated systems, demonstrate the desirable performance of the proposed filter.",0,0,1
"Siting and Sizing of Energy Storage Systems: Towards a Unified Approach for Transmission and Distribution System Operators for Reserve Provision and Grid Support
This paper presents a method to determine the optimal location, energy capacity, and power rating of distributed battery energy storage systems at multiple voltage levels to accomplish grid control and reserve provision. We model operational scenarios at a one-hour resolution, where deviations of stochastic loads and renewable generation (modeled through scenarios) from a day-ahead unit commitment and violations of grid constraints are compensated by either dispatchable power plants (conventional reserves) or injections from battery energy storage systems. By plugging-in costs of conventional reserves and capital costs of converter power ratings and energy storage capacity, the model is able to derive requirements for storage deployment that achieve the technical-economical optimum of the problem. The method leverages an efficient linearized formulation of the grid constraints of both the HV (High Voltage) and MV (Medium Voltage) grids while still retaining fundamental modeling aspects of the power system (such as transmission losses, effect of reactive power, OLTC at the MV/HV interface, unideal efficiency of battery energy storage systems) and models of conventional generator.

"Machine learning models for predicting international tourist arrivals in Indonesia during the COVID-19 pandemic: a multisource Internet data approach
Purpose: This research presents machine learning models for predicting international tourist arrivals in Indonesia during the COVID-19 pandemic using multisource Internet data. Design/methodology/approach: To develop the prediction models, this research utilizes multisource Internet data from TripAdvisor travel forum and Google Trends. Temporal factors, posts and comments, search queries index and previous tourist arrivals records are set as predictors. Four sets of predictors and three distinct data compositions were utilized for training the machine learning models, namely artificial neural networks (ANNs), support vector regression (SVR) and random forest (RF). To evaluate the models, this research uses three accuracy metrics, namely root mean square error (RMSE), mean absolute error (MAE) and mean absolute percentage error (MAPE). Findings: Prediction models trained using multisource Internet data predictors have better accuracy than those trained using single-source Internet data or other predictors. In addition, using more training sets that cover the phenomenon of interest, such as COVID-19, will enhance the prediction model's learning process and accuracy. The experiments show that the RF models have better prediction accuracy than the ANN and SVR models. Originality/value: First, this study pioneers the practice of a multisource Internet data approach in predicting tourist arrivals amid the unprecedented COVID-19 pandemic. Second, the use of multisource Internet data to improve prediction performance is validated with real empirical data. Finally, this is one of the few papers to provide perspectives on the current dynamics of Indonesia's tourism demand. © 2021, Dinda Thalia Andariesta and Meditya Wasesa.",0,1,0

"Investigating Consumer Decision-Making Styles of Car Buyers in Croatia
This research sought to explore consumer decision-making styles of buyers in the car market in the Republic of Croatia. Additional aim of this research was also to add on the literature on consumer decision-making styles to further the understanding of the specificity of consumer behavior when buying a car. The research was conducted with in-depth interviews with car buyers using a non-probability purposive sample. Furthermore, interviews were conducted with car dealership employees who were consulted for additional information. The results indicate that car buyers in the Republic of Croatia make their car buying decisions based on specific consumer decision-making styles. Based on the relevant literature and empirical research, ten consumer decision-making styles specific to car buyers in the Republic of Croatia were identified: price sensitivity, susceptibility to the influence of others, interest in automobiles, involvement in car purchase, brand loyalty, and brand, quality, aesthetics, innovation and functionality consciousness. The research was conducted on a sample of respondents from the Croatian market, so the results cannot be applied to other markets. Also, the study was conducted on a smaller and a non-representative sample, so the results should be verified on a larger and representative sample.",0,1,0
"Building customer-based brand equity : a blueprint for creating strong brands
and others at both organizations for their support and valuable input. Special thanks to Grey Advertising's Ben Arno who suggested the term brand resonance. Additional thanks to workshop participants at Duke University and Dartmouth College. MSI was established in 1961 as a not-for profit institute with the goal of bringing together business leaders and academics to create knowledge that will improve business performance. The primary mission was to provide intellectual leadership in marketing and its allied fields. Over the years, MSI's global network of scholars from leading graduate schools of management and thought leaders from sponsoring corporations has expanded to encompass multiple business functions and disciplines. Issues of key importance to business performance are identified by the Board of Trustees, which represents MSI corporations and the academic community. MSI supports studies by academics on these issues and disseminates the results through conferences and workshops, as well as through its publications series. This report, prepared with the support of MSI, is being sent to you for your information and review. It is not to be reproduced or published, in any form or by any means, electronic or mechanical, without written permission from the Institute and the author. Building a strong brand has been shown to provide numerous financial rewards to firms, and has become a top priority for many organizations. In this report, author Keller outlines the Customer-Based Brand Equity (CBBE) model to assist management in their brand-building efforts. According to the model, building a strong brand involves four steps: (1) establishing the proper brand identity, that is, establishing breadth and depth of brand awareness, (2) creating the appropriate brand meaning through strong, favorable, and unique brand associations, (3) eliciting positive, accessible brand responses, and (4) forging brand relationships with customers that are characterized by intense, active loyalty. Achieving these four steps, in turn, involves establishing six brand-building blocks—brand salience, brand performance, brand imagery, brand judgments, brand feelings, and brand resonance. The most valuable brand-building block, brand resonance, occurs when all the other brand-building blocks are established. With true brand resonance, customers express a high degree of loyalty to the brand such that they actively seek means to interact with the brand and share their experiences with others. Firms that are able to achieve brand resonance should reap a host of benefits, for example, greater price premiums and more efficient and effective marketing programs. The CBBE model provides a yardstick by …",0,0,0
"Mechanisms and Attributes of Echo Chambers in Social Media
Echo chambers may exclude social media users from being exposed to other opinions, therefore, can cause rampant negative effects. Among abundant evidence are the 2016 and 2020 US presidential elections conspiracy theories and polarization, as well as the COVID-19 disinfodemic. To help better detect echo chambers and mitigate its negative effects, this paper explores the mechanisms and attributes of echo chambers in social media. In particular, we first illustrate four primary mechanisms related to three main factors: human psychology, social networks, and automatic systems. We then depict common attributes of echo chambers with a focus on the diffusion of misinformation, spreading of conspiracy theory, creation of social trends, political polarization, and emotional contagion of users. We illustrate each mechanism and attribute in a multi-perspective of sociology, psychology, and social computing with recent case studies. Our analysis suggest an emerging need to detect echo chambers and mitigate their negative effects.",0,0,0

"Multiphase Flow and Boiling Heat Transfer Modelling of Nanofluids in a Metal Foam Embedded in Horizontal Tubes
The aim of this numerical study is to evaluate the boiling process of nanofluid in horizontal tubes in the presence of a metal foam as a porous medium and represent the experimental work of Zhao et al. in a numerical aspect with a different range of dependent variables. High conductive metal foams are employed to increase the rate of heat transfer and enhance the boiling performance in the domain. The two-phase mixture model is used to simulate the characteristics of nanofluid and solve the governing equations in the two-phase flow and boiling heat transfer problem. R134a and ZnO are considered as the base-fluid and nanoparticles, respectively. The characteristics of the metal foam including the porosity and pore density as well as operating conditions including the fluid flow including the velocity, induced heat flux and concentration of nanoparticles on the pressure drop, vapour quality and heat transfer coefficient are examined. The results show the positive effect of the metal foam on the vapour production and overall heat transfer coefficient of the nanofluid in the pipe outlet; however, due to the flow resistance as a result of porous medium addition, a higher pressure drop is achieved. For the heat flux of 19 kW/m 2 and inlet velocity of 0.05m/s, by using a metal foam with the porosity of 70 % and pore density of 20 PPI, the vapour quality, heat transfer coefficient and pressure drop enhances by 7.1%, 9.4% and 82.7%, respectively, compared with the case of without metal foam. However, by using the porosity of 90 %, the vapour quality, heat transfer coefficient and pressure drop enhances by 1.6%, 3.5%, and 7.0%, respectively. Consequently, according to the developed results in this paper, a system with a moderate porosity and high pore density is recommended which is finally determined based on the required vapour production and allowed pressure drop.",0,1,1
"Aggressive Racecar Drifting Control Using Onboard Cameras and Inertial Measurement Unit
Complex autonomous driving, such as drifting, requires high-precision and high-frequency pose information to ensure accuracy and safety, which is notably difficult when using only onboard sensors. In this paper, we propose a drift controller with two feedback control loops: a sideslip controller that stabilizes the sideslip angle by tuning the front wheel steering angle, and a circle controller that maintains a stable trajectory radius and circle center by controlling the wheel rotational speed. We use an extended Kalman filter to estimate the state. A robustified KASA algorithm is further proposed to accurately estimate the parameters of the circle (i.e., the center and radius) that best fits into the current trajectory. On the premise of the uniform circular motion of the vehicle in the process of stable drift, we use angle information instead of acceleration to describe the dynamic of the vehicle. We implement our method on a 1/10 scale racecar. The car drifts stably with a given center and radius, which illustrates the effectiveness of our method.",0,1,1

"A Markov decision process-based policy characterization approach for a stochastic inventory control problem with unreliable sourcing
We consider a single-product periodic-review inventory system for a retailer who has adopted a dual sourcing strategy to cope with potential supply process interruptions. Orders are placed to a perfectly reliable supplier and/or to a less reliable supplier that offers a better price. The success of an order placed to the unreliable supplier depends on his supply status that has a Markovian nature. The inventory control problem for this unreliable supply chain is modeled as a discrete-time Markov decision process (MDP) in order to find the optimal ordering decisions. Through numerical experimentation, the structure of the optimal ordering policy under several cost scenarios and different supplier reliability levels is determined. Four basic policy structures are found and are referred as case 1: order only from the unreliable supplier; case 2: order simultaneously from both suppliers or only from the unreliable supplier depending on the inventory level; case 3: order from one or the other but not both suppliers simultaneously; and case 4: order only from the reliable supplier. For all cases, (s, S)-like policies characterize perfectly the optimal ordering decisions due to the existence of the fixed ordering cost. Further experimentation is done to study the effects of changes in several system parameters (cost parameters such as fixed ordering cost, unit purchasing cost, backorder cost as well as the supplier reliability level) on the ordering policy and cost of the system.",0,1,0

"Turbulent channel flow with either transverse or longitudinal roughness elements on one wall
Direct numerical simulation results are presented for turbulent channel flows with two-dimensional roughness elements of different shapes. The focus is mainly on a geometry where the separation between consecutive roughness elements is small and for which the rate of change of the roughness function with respect to the separation between consecutive elements is large. Roughness elements are placed either along the flow direction or orthogonally to it. In the latter case, the drag is increased. For the former case, the possibility of drag reduction reflects the different relative contributions from viscous and Reynolds shear stresses. The Reynolds shear stress depends on the shape of the surface more than the viscous stress and is closely related to the near-wall structures. For orthogonal elements, there is no satisfactory correlation between the roughness function and parameters describing the roughness geometry. On the other hand, a satisfactory collapse of the data is achieved when the roughness function is plotted against the root mean square wall-normal velocity averaged over the plane of the roughness crests. Relative to a smooth wall surface, the Reynolds stress tensor near the wall tends to become more isotropic when the elements are orthogonal to the flow and less isotropic when the elements are aligned with the flow. The interdependencies between the departure from isotropy in the wall region, the organization of the wall structures, and the magnitude of the drag are assessed by examining the rotational component of the turbulent kinetic energy production and the probability density function of the helicity density.",0,1,1
"Comparing Complementary Kalman Filters Against SLAM for Collaborative Localization of Heterogeneous Multi-Robot Teams

 This paper presents an investigation of collaborative localization for heterogeneous robots, resulting in a scheme for relative localization of a heterogeneous team of lowcost mobile robots. A novel complementary Kalman Filter (CKF) approach is presented to address collaborative localization and mapping by optimally estimating the error states of the team. This indirect filter optimally combines the inertial/visual proprioceptive measurements of each vehicle with stereoscopic measurements made by the UGVs. An analysis is presented for both Complementary Kalman Filter (CKF) and Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) approaches on maps containing randomly placed obstacles. In both simulation and experiments, we demonstrate the proposed methodology with a heterogeneous robot team. Six behavioral strategies, specifying the role and behavior of each robot, are simulated and evaluated for both CKF and SLAM approaches on maps containing randomly placed obstacles. Results show that the sources of error, image quantization, asynchronous sensors, and a non-stationary bias, were sufficiently modeled to estimate the pose of the aerial robot. The results demonstrate localization accuracies of 2 cm to 4 cm, on average, while the robots operate at a distance from each-other between 1 m and 4 m. The best performing behavior for the CKF approach maintained an average positional error of 2.2 cm and a relative error of 0.30% of the distance traveled for the entire team at the conclusion of maneuvers. For all multi-UGV strategies, the CKF approach outperformed the best SLAM results by 6.7 cm mean error (0.48% of distance traveled).",0,1,1
"A STUDY OF THE THICKNESS EFFECT IN FATIGUE DESIGN USING THE HOT SPOT STRESS METHOD
The thickness effect is the phenomenon that the fatigue strength of a welded connection decreases when the thickness of load carrying plate increases. The thickness effect is observed in details where the fatigue crack initiation takes place at the weld toe. The hot spot stress approach is a fatigue design approach based on the structural stress obtained from Finite element Analysis (FEA) results. This method is more suitable when calculation of load effects is made using finite element method. Even though the method has been used for more than 20 years, it is yet not fully completed. One problem in this respect is how to account for the thickness effect, a problem which is not included in design codes and recommendations. Instead, the thickness effect conditions for the nominal stress method have been used with the hot spot stress. The thickness effect using the hot spot stress approach for stress determination for welded joints is studied in this thesis. A database containing fatigue test results with a number of selected welded joints is chosen for the analysis. Different types of modelling technique (according to the International Institute of Welding) have been applied to analyze the selected joints and the models were analysed using the FE program ABAQUS. The structural hot spot stresses are determined according to the IIW and other stress determination methods. Finally the result data obtained from the FEA are compared with the result from fatigue test data. The results show that the thickness effect correction factors in the hot spot stress approach are the same as the values obtained for the nominal stress approach for two of studied details. For the third detail, the thickness effect correction factor in the hot spot stress approach is larger than that for the nominal stress approach. There is no thickness effect when the so called “1 mm stress approach” is used for the cruciform joint.",0,0,1

"Noise modeling and analysis of an IMU-based attitude sensor: improvement of performance by filtering and sensor fusion
We describe the characterization and removal of noises present in the Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) MPU- 6050, which was initially used in an attitude sensor, and later used in the development of a pointing system for small balloon-borne astronomical payloads. We found that the performance of the IMU degraded with time because of the accumulation of different errors. Using Allan variance analysis method, we identified the different components of noise present in the IMU, and verified the results by the power spectral density analysis (PSD). We tried to remove the high-frequency noise using smooth filters such as moving average filter and then Savitzky Golay (SG) filter. Even though we managed to filter some high-frequency noise, these filters performance wasn't satisfactory for our application. We found the distribution of the random noise present in IMU using probability density analysis and identified that the noise in our IMU was white Gaussian in nature. Hence, we used a Kalman filter to remove the noise and which gave us good performance real time.",1,1,1
"Enlivening Redundant Heads in Multi-head Self-attention for Machine Translation
Multi-head self-attention recently attracts enormous interest owing to its specialized functions, significant parallelizable computation, and flexible extensibility. However, very recent empirical studies show that some self-attention heads make little contribution and can be pruned as redundant heads. This work takes a novel perspective of identifying and then vitalizing redundant heads. We propose a redundant head enlivening (RHE) method to precisely identify redundant heads, and then vitalize their potential by learning syntactic relations and prior knowledge in the text without sacrificing the roles of important heads. Two novel syntax-enhanced attention (SEA) mechanisms: a dependency mask bias and a relative local-phrasal position bias, are introduced to revise self-attention distributions for syntactic enhancement in machine translation. The importance of individual heads is dynamically evaluated during the redundant heads identification, on which we apply SEA to vitalize redundant heads while maintaining the strength of important heads. Experimental results on widely adopted WMT14 and WMT16 English to German and English to Czech language machine translation validate the RHE effectiveness.",0,0,1
"A Systematic Review of Productivity Factors in Software Development
Analysing and improving productivity has been one of the main goals of software engineering research since its beginnings. A plethora of studies has been conducted on various factors that resulted in several models for analysis and prediction of productivity. However, productivity is still an issue in current software development and not all factors and their relationships are known. This paper reviews the large body of available literature in order to distill a list of the main factors influencing productivity investigated so far. The measure for importance here is the number of articles a factor is mentioned in. Special consideration is given to soft or human-related factors in software engineering that are often not analysed with equal detail as more technical factors. The resulting list can be used to guide further analysis and as basis for building productivity models.",0,1,0
"Risk Mitigation in Automotive Supply Chain: An Empirical Exploration of Enablers to Implement Supply Chain Risk Management
Supply chain (SC) risk management (SCRM) is a high-level concern for SC professionals. Supply chain risk management implementation is a difficult task because it requires involvement of various firms across the SC. For effective SCRM implementation, managers need to know the enabling factors and their relative importance. In this research, an empirical study on SC risk mitigation enablers was carried out in Indian automotive industry to examine the relationship between SCRM enablers and SCRM implementation. This relationship was tested using discriminant analysis. The research shows that the most important enabler is information visibility and it is followed by incentives alignment. Contingency planning is the third-most important enabler and last is risk management governance (RMG). Success of the SCRM implementation in terms of its efficiency and effectiveness can be assured by following the sequence of SCRM enablers suggested in this research.",0,1,0

A unitary, lightweight outer garment constructed of a thin polyethylene film includes front and rear panels which are joined together forming a medial body member, paired arms which extend outwardly and downwardly from the upper portion of the body member, and a head opening which is located in the upper margin of the body member. The arms and body member are arranged to have unjoined coplanar lower margins and the inner side margin of each arm and the adjacent side margin of the body member lie congruously along a common line. The garment is formed by placing two rectangular sheets of the film, having a width equal to the finished length of the garment, in overlying engagement with one another on a cutting surface, thermally die cutting the sheets into the appropriate shape, and thermally sealing the resulting cut margins to complete the garment.",0,0,1
"Windowing and random weighting based cubature RTS smoothing for target tracking
This paper presents windowing and random weighting (WRW) based adaptive cubature Rauch–Tung–Striebel (CRTS) smoother (WRWACRTS). The Unscented KF (WRWUKF) has already existed as an alternative to nonlinear smoothing solutions. In the proposed method, both windowing and random weighted estimation methods are combined together, and used to estimate the noise statistics. Subsequently, the weights of each window are adjusting randomly, and update the process and measurement noise covariances matrices at each epoch. The developed WRWACRTS algorithm overcomes the limitation of the conventional CKS. The Lyapunov function-based approach is used to investigate the convergence proof of the WRWACRTS algorithm. A numerical example is shown to demonstrate the performance of the proposed algorithm.",1,1,1
"Dynamic locomotion for passive-ankle biped robots and humanoids using whole-body locomotion control
Whole-body control (WBC) is a generic task-oriented control method for feedback control of loco-manipulation behaviors in humanoid robots. The combination of WBC and model-based walking controllers has been widely utilized in various humanoid robots. However, to date, the WBC method has not been employed for unsupported passive-ankle dynamic locomotion. As such, in this article, we devise a new WBC, dubbed the whole-body locomotion controller (WBLC), that can achieve experimental dynamic walking on unsupported passive-ankle biped robots. A key aspect of WBLC is the relaxation of contact constraints such that the control commands produce reduced jerk when switching foot contacts. To achieve robust dynamic locomotion, we conduct an in-depth analysis of uncertainty for our dynamic walking algorithm called the time-to-velocity-reversal (TVR) planner. The uncertainty study is fundamental as it allows us to improve the control algorithms and mechanical structure of our robot to fulfill the tolerated uncertainty. In addition, we conduct extensive experimentation for: (1) unsupported dynamic balancing (i.e., in-place stepping) with a six-degree-of-freedom biped, Mercury; (2) unsupported directional walking with Mercury; (3) walking over an irregular and slippery terrain with Mercury; and 4) in-place walking with our newly designed ten-DoF viscoelastic liquid-cooled biped, DRACO. Overall, the main contributions of this work are on: (a) achieving various modalities of unsupported dynamic locomotion of passive-ankle bipeds using a WBLC controller and a TVR planner; (b) conducting an uncertainty analysis to improve the mechanical structure and the controllers of Mercury; and (c) devising a whole-body control strategy that reduces movement jerk during walking.",0,1,1
"pymgrid: An Open-Source Python Microgrid Simulator for Applied Artificial Intelligence Research
Microgrids, self contained electrical grids that are capable of disconnecting from the main grid, hold potential in both tackling climate change mitigation via reducing CO2 emissions and adaptation by increasing infrastructure resiliency. Due to their distributed nature, microgrids are often idiosyncratic; as a result, control of these systems is nontrivial. While microgrid simulators exist, many are limited in scope and in the variety of microgrids they can simulate. We propose pymgrid, an open-source Python package to generate and simulate a large number of microgrids, and the first open-source tool that can generate more than 600 different microgrids. pymgrid abstracts most of the domain expertise, allowing users to focus on control algorithms. In particular, pymgrid is built to be a reinforcement learning (RL) platform, and includes the ability to model microgrids as Markov decision processes. pymgrid also introduces two pre-computed list of microgrids, intended to allow for research reproducibility in the microgrid setting.",1,1,1

"Path Loss Measurement for GSM Terrains in Lagos State, Nigeria
This paper presents report of research work on comparative analysis of Pathloss measurements based on terrain differences, frequencies of operation and distance between Base Transceiver Station (BTS) and Mobile Station (MS). Lagos state G.S.M terrains with 2G (900MHz / 1800MHz) and 3G (2100MHz) frequencies of operation were put under investigation. Field data were collected through drive tests from twelve (12) different sites using TEMS software in the chosen environments over a range of distance between 0.510Km from Base station (BS) to Mobile station (MS) with measurement taken at 0.5Km intervals for a period of one year (52 weeks). Strategically Lagos-Island (N6 27.4832’ E3 23.5453’), Surulere (N6 33.3844’ E3 20.9407’), Lekki-Oniru (N6 26.6661’ E3 28.7463’) and Agbede-Ikorodu (N6 39.9250’ E3 29.0363’) were chosen as dense-urban (DU), urban (UR), sub-urban (SU) and non-urban (NU) G.S.M terrains respectively. In this research work Rxlev/RSSI and Pathloss were measured in all areas of investigation and empirical Cost231-Hata model was used for pathloss calculation of field data, and its results were compared with Pathloss measured through drive tests. The measured pathloss, when compared with empirical values from the COST 231 theoretical models, showed a close agreement with the pathloss predicted by the COST231Hata model in terms of mean square error analysis. During our findings it was revealed that Pathloss increases with distance between BTS and MS, Pathloss also increases with frequency of operation; hence 3G networks experience more pathloss than 2G and from further analysis it was observed that Pathloss increases from Non-Urban to Sub-Urban to Urban and Dense-Urban respectively when compared using different terrain characteristics.

"Noise and the Reality Gap: The Use of Simulation in Evolutionary Robotics
The pitfalls of naive robot simulations have been recognised for areas such as evolutionary robotics. It has been suggested that carefully validated simulations with a proper treatment of noise may overcome these problems. This paper reports the results of experiments intended to test some of these claims. A simulation was constructed of a two-wheeled Khepera robot with IR and ambient light sensors. This included detailed mathematical models of the robot-environment interaction dynamics with empirically determined parameters. Artificial evolution was used to develop recurrent dynamical network controllers for the simulated robot, for obstacle-avoidance and light-seeking tasks, using different levels of noise in the simulation. The evolved controllers were down-loaded onto the real robot and the correspondence between behaviour in simulation and in reality was tested. The level of correspondence varied according to how much noise was used in the simulation, with very good results achieved when realistic quantities were applied. It has been demonstrated that it is possible to develop successful robot controllers in simulation that generate almost identical behaviours in reality, at least for a particular class of robot-environment interaction dynamics.",0,0,1
"""How Was Your Weekend?"" Software Development Teams Working From Home During COVID-19
The mass shift to working at home during the COVID-19 pandemic radically changed the way many software development teams collaborate and communicate. To investigate how team culture and team productivity may also have been affected, we conducted two surveys at a large software company. The first, an exploratory survey during the early months of the pandemic with 2,265 developer responses, revealed that many developers faced challenges reaching milestones and that their team productivity had changed. We also found through qualitative analysis that important team culture factors such as communication and social connection had been affected. For example, the simple phrase ""How was your weekend?"" had become a subtle way to show peer support. In our second survey, we conducted a quantitative analysis of the team cultural factors that emerged from our first survey to understand the prevalence of the reported changes. From 608 developer responses, we found that 74% of these respondents missed social interactions with colleagues and 51% reported a decrease in their communication ease with colleagues. We used data from the second survey to build a regression model to identify important team culture factors for modeling team productivity. We found that the ability to brainstorm with colleagues, difficulty communicating with colleagues, and satisfaction with interactions from social activities are important factors that are associated with how developers report their software development team's productivity. Our findings inform how managers and leaders in large software companies can support sustained team productivity during times of crisis and beyond.",0,1,0
"Experiences Applying the People Capability Maturity Model
T he People Capability Maturity Model ® (People CMM ®) is a road map for implementing workforce practices that continually improve the capability of an organization's work force. The People CMM 1 is a process-based model that assumes workforce practices are organizational processes that can be continuously improved through the same methods used to improve other business processes. In particular, the People CMM assumes that workforce practices can be improved through the staged process transformations that underpin Humphrey's Process Maturity Framework [7]. The People CMM applies the Process Maturity Framework to develop the workforce capability of an organization. Each successive level of the People CMM produces a unique transformation of the organization's culture by equipping it with more powerful practices for attracting, developing, organizing, motivating , and retaining its work force. The People CMM establishes an integrated system of workforce practices that mature through increasing alignment with the organization's business objectives, performance , and changing needs. Although the People CMM was designed primarily for application in knowledge-intense organizations, it can be applied in almost any organizational setting with appropriate tailoring. The practices at Level 3 of any well-formed capability maturity model produce an architecture for a critical aspect of an organization's strategic infrastructure. For instance, Level 3 practices in the Capability Maturity Model ® for Software (SW-CMM ®) and CMM Integration SM (CMMI ®) produce the architectures of standardized processes that support an organization's software and systems business. Likewise, the People CMM produces the architecture of workforce competen-cies an organization requires for executing its business. Achieving Level 3 of the People CMM and either SW-CMM or CMMI will enable an organization to have a standardized architecture for its development processes and a strategically designed work force strong in the domain specialties required to perform them. The People CMM was designed to achieve four objectives in developing an organization's work force: develop individual capability, build work groups and culture , motivate and manage performance, and shape the work force. Figure 1 depicts how the process areas at each maturity level are organized to support the four primary objectives (represented in the columns) of the People CMM. Although the People CMM can be represented in the appearance of a continuous model, failure to implement a cohesive system (or bundle) of integrated practices at each level can have harmful consequences. One example of these consequences is often seen in organizations that encourage people …",0,0,0
"Universal Non-Intrusive Load Monitoring (UNILM) Using Filter Pipelines, Probabilistic Knapsack, and Labelled Partition Maps
Being able to track appliances energy usage without the need of sensors can help occupants reduce their energy consumption to help save the environment all while saving money. Non-intrusive load monitoring (NILM) tries to do just that. One of the hardest problems NILM faces is the ability to run unsupervised - discovering appliances without prior knowledge - and to run independent of the differences in appliance mixes and operational characteristics found in various countries and regions. We propose a solution that can do this with the use of an advanced filter pipeline to preprocess the data, a Gaussian appliance model with a probabilistic knapsack algorithm to disaggregate the aggregate smart meter signal, and partition maps to label which appliances were found and how much energy they use no matter the country/region. Experimental results show that relatively complex appliance signals can be tracked accounting for 93.7% of the total aggregate energy consumed.",1,0,1
"Political participation in a digital age: an integrated perspective on the impacts of the internet on voter turnout
E-government is the use of information technology, especially telecommunications, to enable and improve the efficiency with which government services and information are provided to its constituents. Internet voting is an emerging e-government initiative. It refers to the submission of votes securely and secretly over the Internet. In the United States some areas have already used Internet voting systems for local and state elections. 
Many researchers argue that one of the most important social impacts of Internet voting is the effect it could have on voter participation. Numerous studies have called for research on the impact of technology on voter turnout; however, existing literature has yet to develop a comprehensive model of the key factors that influence Internet voting adoption. In light of the gradual implementation of I-voting systems and the need for research on I-voting implications this study combines political science and information systems constructs to present an integrated model of Internet voter participation. The proposed model of Internet voting adoption posits that a combination of technical, political and demographic factors amalgamate to influence the adoption of I-voting services. The study was conducted by surveying 372 citizens ranging in age from 18-75. The findings indicate that an integrated model of I-voting adoption is superior to existing models that explore political science or technology adoption constructs in isolation. Implications of this study for research and practice are presented.",0,1,0
"Thermal-Inertial SLAM for the Environments With Challenging Illumination
In recent years, longwave infrared (LWIR) cameras have become potential in visual simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) research since the delivered thermal images can provide information beyond the visible spectrum and are robust to environment illumination. However, due to modality differences, SLAM methods designed for visible cameras cannot be directly applied to thermal data. In this paper, we propose a thermal-inertial SLAM method for all-day autonomous systems. To overcome the challenge of the thermal data association, the proposed method represents several improvements, including singular-value-decomposition-based (SVD-based) image processing and ThermalRAFT tracking methods. Based on the characteristics of the thermal images, the SVD-based image processing method can exploit the fixed noise pattern of thermal images and enhance the image quality to improve the performance of subsequent steps, including thermal feature extraction and loop detection. To achieve real-time and robust feature tracking, we develop ThermalRAFT, an efficient optical flow network with iterative optimization. Moreover, the system introduces a bag-of-words-based loop detection method to maintain global consistency in long-term operation. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method can provide competitive performance in indoor and outdoor environments and is robust under challenging illumination conditions.",0,1,1
"Simulation of unsteady blood flows in a patient‐specific compliant pulmonary artery with a highly parallel monolithically coupled fluid‐structure interaction algorithm
Computational fluid dynamics (CFD) is increasingly used to study blood flows in patient‐specific arteries for understanding certain cardiovascular diseases. The techniques work quite well for relatively simple problems but need improvements when the problems become harder when (a) the geometry becomes complex (eg, a few branches to a full pulmonary artery), (b) the model becomes more complex (eg, fluid‐only to coupled fluid‐structure interaction), (c) both the fluid and wall models become highly nonlinear, and (d) the computer on which we run the simulation is a supercomputer with tens of thousands of processor cores. To push the limit of CFD in all four fronts, in this paper, we develop and study a highly parallel algorithm for solving a monolithically coupled fluid‐structure system for the modeling of the interaction of the blood flow and the arterial wall. As a case study, we consider a patient‐specific, full size pulmonary artery obtained from computed tomography (CT) images, with an artificially added layer of wall with a fixed thickness. The fluid is modeled with a system of incompressible Navier‐Stokes equations, and the wall is modeled by a geometrically nonlinear elasticity equation. As far as we know, this is the first time the unsteady blood flow in a full pulmonary artery is simulated without assuming a rigid wall. The proposed numerical algorithm and software scale well beyond 10 000 processor cores on a supercomputer for solving the fluid‐structure interaction problem discretized with a stabilized finite element method in space and an implicit scheme in time involving hundreds of millions of unknowns.",1,1,1
"Factors Influencing Individual Investor Behavior: An Empirical study of the UAE Financial Markets
This paper aims at identifying factors influencing the UAE investor behavior. It develops a modified questionnaire. The questionnaire included thirty four items that belonge to five categories, namely, self-image/ firm-image co-incidence; accounting information; neutral information; advocate recommendations; and personal financial needs. Six factors were found to be the most influencing factors on the UAE investor behavior. The most influencing factor was in order of importance: expected corporate earnings, get rich quick, stock marketability, past performance of the firm’s stock, government holdings and the creation of the organized financial markets. On the other hand, five factors were found to be the least influencing factors on the UAE investor behavior. The least influencing factors in order of importance were: expected losses in other local investments, minimizing risk, expected losses in international financial markets, , family member opinions, gut feeling on the economy. Two factors had unexpectedly least influence on the behavior of the UAE investors behavior, namely the religious beliefs and the factor of family member opinions. JEL Classification: G1;G11",0,0,0

"Diverse Multimedia Layout Generation with Multi Choice Learning
Designing visually appealing layouts for multimedia documents containing text, graphs and images requires a form of creative intelligence. Modelling the generation of layouts has recently gained attention due to its importance in aesthetics and communication style. In contrast to standard prediction tasks, there are a range of acceptable layouts which depend on user preferences. For example, a poster designer may prefer logos on the top-left while another prefers logos on the bottom-right. Both are correct choices yet existing machine learning models treat layouts as a single choice prediction problem. In such situations, these models would simply average over all possible choices given the same input forming a degenerate sample. In the above example, this would form an unacceptable layout with a logo in the centre. In this paper, we present an auto-regressive neural network architecture, called LayoutMCL, that uses multi-choice prediction and winner-takes-all loss to effectively stabilise layout generation. LayoutMCL avoids the averaging problem by using multiple predictors to learn a range of possible options for each layout object. This enables LayoutMCL to generate multiple and diverse layouts from a single input which is in contrast with existing approaches which yield similar layouts with minor variations. Through quantitative benchmarks on real data (magazine, document and mobile app layouts), we demonstrate that LayoutMCL reduces Fréchet Inception Distance (FID) by 83-98% and generates significantly more diversity in comparison to existing approaches.",0,0,0

"Diversity for transfer in learning-based control of buildings
The application of reinforcement learning to the optimal control of building systems has gained traction in recent years as it can cut the building energy consumption and improve human comfort. Despite using sample-efficient reinforcement learning algorithms, most related work requires several months of sensor data and operational parameters of the building to train an agent that outperforms existing rule-based controllers in a large multi-zone building. Moreover, exploring the large state and action spaces can result in poor indoor environmental quality for occupants. In this paper, we propose to reduce the training cost of a policy gradient reinforcement learning algorithm by learning a library of control policies on a training building and taking advantage of both environmental and policy diversity. To transfer these policies to a target building, which can be different from the training building, we develop a simple method to assign the best pretrained policy in the library to each zone of the target building. We show that even without retraining the transferred policies on the target building, they can reduce the HVAC energy consumption by 40.4% compared to a fixed-schedule baseline and by 48.97% compared to agents trained on the target building for 5,000 months. The plausibility of our results underscores the importance of using diversity and transfer learning in multi-agent reinforcement learning settings and could pave the way for the adoption of reinforcement-learning based controllers in real buildings.",0,1,1
"Towards Understanding How Readers Integrate Charts and Captions: A Case Study with Line Charts
Charts often contain visually prominent features that draw attention to aspects of the data and include text captions that emphasize aspects of the data. Through a crowdsourced study, we explore how readers gather takeaways when considering charts and captions together. We first ask participants to mark visually prominent regions in a set of line charts. We then generate text captions based on the prominent features and ask participants to report their takeaways after observing chart-caption pairs. We find that when both the chart and caption describe a high-prominence feature, readers treat the doubly emphasized high-prominence feature as the takeaway; when the caption describes a low-prominence chart feature, readers rely on the chart and report a higher-prominence feature as the takeaway. We also find that external information that provides context, helps further convey the caption’s message to the reader. We use these findings to provide guidelines for authoring effective chart-caption pairs.",1,1,0
"Substation One-Line Diagram Automatic Generation and Visualization
In Energy Management System (EMS) applications and many other off-line planning and study tools, one-line diagram (OLND) of the whole system and stations is a straightforward view for planners and operators to design, monitor, analyze, and control the power system. Large-scale power system OLND is usually manually developed and maintained. The work is tedious, time-consuming and ease to make mistake. Meanwhile, the manually created diagrams are hard to be shared among the on-line and off-line systems. To save the time and efforts to draw and maintain OLNDs, and provide the capability to share the OLNDs, a tool to automatically develop substation based upon Common Information Model (CIM) standard is needed. Currently, there is no standard rule to draw the substation OLND. Besides, the substation layouts can be altered from the typical formats in textbooks based on factors of economy, efficiency, engineering practice, etc. This paper presents a tool on substation OLND automatic generation and visualization. This tool takes the substation CIM/E model as input, then automatically computes the coordinates of all components and generates the substation OLND based on its components attributes and connectivity relations. Evaluation of the proposed approach is presented using a real provincial power system. Over 95% of substation OLNDs are decently presented and the rest are corner cases, needing extra effort to do specific reconfiguration.",1,1,1
"An Overview of Ultra-WideBand (UWB) Standards(IEEE 802.15.4, FiRa, Apple): Interoperability Aspects and Future Research Directions
This work has been submitted to the IEEE for possible publication. Copyright may be transferred without notice, after which this version may no longer be accessible Abstract—The increasing popularity of ultra-wideband (UWB) technology for location-based services such as access control and real-time indoor track&tracing, as well as UWB support in new consumer devices such as smartphones, has resulted in the availability of multiple new UWB radio chips. However, due to this increase in UWB device availability, the question of which (industry) standards and configuration factors impact UWB interoperability and compatibility becomes increasingly important. In this paper, the fundamentals of UWB compatibility are investigated by first giving an overview of different UWB radio chips on the market. After that, an overview of UWB standards and standardisation entities is given. Next, this overview is used to discuss the focus of these different standards and to identify the differences between them. We describe compatibility issues and associated interoperability aspects related to PHY, MAC, and upper layers. For the PHY layer, compatibility is possible for all UWB chips if the correct settings are configured. For the MAC layer, the implementation of the multiple access scheme as well as the localization technique is mostly proprietary. For the device discovery, several standards are currently being drafted. Finally, future challenges related to UWB interoperability are discussed.",0,0,0
"A Column Generation Algorithm for the Resource-Constrained Order Acceptance and Scheduling on Unrelated Parallel Machines
In this paper, we investigate the resource-constrained order acceptance and scheduling on unrelated parallel machines that arise in make-to-order systems. The objective of this problem is to simultaneously select a subset of orders to be processed and schedule the accepted orders on unrelated machines in such a way that the resources are not overutilized at any time. We first propose two formulations for the problem: mixed integer linear programming formulation and set partitioning. In view of the complexity of the problem, we then develop a column generation approach based on the set partitioning formulation. In the proposed column generation approach, a differential evolution algorithm is designed to solve subproblems efficiently. Extensive numerical experiments on different-sized instances are conducted, and the results demonstrate that the proposed column generation algorithm reports optimal or near-optimal solutions that are evidently better than the solutions obtained by solving the mixed integer linear programming formulation.",0,1,0

We use structural equation modelling with the partial least squares method and identify effort expectancy, social influence, prevailing opinions on COVID-19 and the CWA, as well as moral and ethical considerations as the most influential predictors. We are able to explain moderate to high amounts of variance with our model. Our results offer valuable insights for the technology acceptance literature and enable practical recommendations for improving the public communication and elevating user numbers of pandemic tracing apps in Germany.",0,0,0
"Decentralized Coordination Between Economic Dispatch and Demand Response in Multi-Energy Systems
In this paper, we investigate the problem of coordination between economic dispatch (ED) and demand response (DR) in multi-energy systems (MESs), aiming to improve the economic utility and reduce the waste of energy in MESs. Since multiple energy sources are coupled through energy hubs (EHs), the supply-demand constraints are nonconvex. To deal with this issue, we propose a linearization method to transform the coordination problem to a convex social welfare optimization one. Then a decentralized algorithm based on parallel Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers (ADMM) and dynamic average tracking protocol is developed, where each agent could only make decisions based on information from their neighbors. Moreover, by using variational inequality and Lyapunov-based techniques, we show that our algorithm could always converge to the global optimal solution. Finally, a case study on the modified IEEE 14-bus network verifies the feasibility and effectiveness of our algorithm.",0,0,1

Pilot studies are often the first step of experimental research. It is usually on a smaller scale and the results can inform intervention development, study feasibility and how the study implementation will play out, if such a larger main study is undertaken. This paper illustrates the relationship between pilot study sample size and the performance study design of main studies. We present two simple sample size calculation methods to ensure adequate study planning for main studies. We use numerical examples and simulations to demonstrate the use and performance of proposed methods. Practical heuristic guidelines are provided based on the results.",0,1,0
"The maximal covering location problem
The belief that mathematical location modeling can identify ""optimal"" location patterns rests on the basis that some realistic objective can be identified and by some measure quantified. For example, in the area of private facilities location analysis, a reasonably accurate statement of the objective of locating warehouses is to minimize the costs of manufacturing and distribution. Since most cost elements included in the objectives of private facility location can be reasonably estimated, the models can picture with some degree of accuracy the real location problem they are designed to solve. Unlike private facility location analysis, the objectives of public facility location analysis are more difficult to embrace and to quantify. The difficulty in defining direct measures of public objectives has resulted in a search for some surrogate measure with which the decision maker may be comfortable. Two different surrogate measures which have received attention in location models are: (1) total weighted distance or time for travel to the facilities, and (2) the distance or time that the user most distant from a facility would have to travel to reach that facility, that is, the maximal service distance.* The use of a maximal service distance as a measure of the value of a given locational configuration has been discussed at length by Toregas and ReVelle 1 who show that it is an important surrogate measurement for the value of a given locational configuration. For a given location solution, the maximum distance which any user would have to travel to reach a facility would reflect the worst possible performance of the system. In the regional location of emergency facilities such as fire stations or ambulance dispatching stations, the concept of the maximal service distance is well established. ~,3 The maximal service distance concept appears in the Location Set Covering",0,0,0
"Identification of opinion leader on rumor spreading in online social network Twitter using edge weighting and centrality measure weighting
Rumor spreading has been an essential issue for society. One of the platforms for rumor spreading is Twitter. Finding the opinion leader of its issue is also important in order to know who are users whom have a high impact of bringing the issue. So we can give the suggestion to the law authority to give the right authorization afterward. Opinion leader can be found using centrality measure metric on social network analysis study. This study has node and edge as its property. For recent years, there are many conducted researches about centrality measure. Some of them are combining some centrality measures together. Aside from defining the centrality measure, defining the edge is also important. Twitter has a different kind of relationships that can be turned into an edge, but not all the relationships have the same impact for spreading the rumor. This study conduct two experiments, first experiment is edge weighting. This experiment is aimed to see the importance of each defined edge type for finding the opinion leader. The second experiment is centrality weighting. This experiment is aimed to see the weight that could give more accurate opinion leader based on other evaluation algorithms. The study found the edge that has the ability to spread to wider audience (quote, retweet, and reply) tend to have a bigger impact for finding opinion leader than mention relationship. The study also finds that a low in-degree weight, high betweenness weight, and low or no PageRank weight could give 100% agreement upon other evaluation algorithms for finding the opinion leader.",0,1,0
"Resilience-Based Performance Modeling and Decision Optimization for Transportation Network
This research presented a novel resilience-based framework to support resilience planning regarding pre-disaster mitigation and post-disaster recovery. 
First, the author proposes a new performance metric for transportation network, weighted number of independent pathways (WIPW), integrating the network topology, redundancy level, traffic patterns, structural reliability of network components, and functionality of the network during community's post-disaster recovery in a systematical way. To the best of our knowledge, WIPW is the only performance metric that permits risk mitigation alternatives for improving transportation network resilience to be compared on a common basis. Based on the WIPW, a decision methodology of prioritizing transportation network retrofit projects is developed. 
Second, our studies extend from pre-disaster mitigation to post-hazard recovery, in which this research presents two metrics to evaluate the restoration over the horizon after disasters . That is, total recovery time and the skew of the recovery trajectory. Both metrics are involved in the multi-objective stochastic optimization problem of restoration scheduling. The metrics provided a new dimension to evaluate the relative efficiency of alternative network recovery strategies. The author then develops a restoration scheduling methodology for network post-disaster recovery that minimizes the overall network recovery time and optimizes the recovery trajectory, which ultimately will reduce economic losses due to network service disruption.",0,0,0
"Sustainable Ammonia Production Processes
Due to the important role of ammonia as a fertilizer in the agricultural industry and its promising prospects as an energy carrier, many studies have recently attempted to find the most environmentally benign, energy efficient, and economically viable production process for ammonia synthesis. The most commonly utilized ammonia production method is the Haber-Bosch process. The downside to this technology is the high greenhouse gas emissions, surpassing 2.16 kgCO2-eq/kg NH3 and high amounts of energy usage of over 30 GJ/tonne NH3 mainly due to the strict operational conditions at high temperature and pressure. The most widely adopted technology for sustainable hydrogen production used for ammonia synthesis is water electrolysis coupled with renewable technologies such as wind and solar. In general, a water electrolyzer requires a continuous supply of pretreated water with high purity levels for its operation. Moreover, for production of 1 tonne of hydrogen, 9 tonnes of water is required. Based on this data, for the production of the same amount of ammonia through water electrolysis, 233.6 million tonnes/yr of water is required. In this paper, a critical review of different sustainable hydrogen production processes and emerging technologies for sustainable ammonia synthesis along with a comparative life cycle assessment of various ammonia production methods has been carried out. We find that through the review of each of the studied technologies, either large amounts of GHG emissions are produced or high volumes of pretreated water is required or a combination of both these factors occur.",0,0,1
"A compact two-phase twisted string actuation system: Modeling and validation
Abstract In this paper, we propose a compact twisted string actuation system that achieves a high contraction percentage (81%) on two phases: multi string twist and overtwist. This type of system can be used in many robotic applications, such as robotic hands and exoskeletons. The overtwist phase enables the development of more compact actuators based on the twisted string systems. Furthermore, by analyzing the previously developed mathematical models, we found out that a constant radius model should be applied for the overtwisting phase. Moreover, we propose an improvement of an existing model for prediction of the radius of the multi string system after they twist around each other. This model helps to better estimate the bundle diameter which results in a more precise mathematical model for multi string systems. The model was validated by performing experiments with 2, 4, 6 and 8 string systems. Finally, we performed extensive life cycle tests with different loads and contractions to find out the expected life of the system.",1,1,1
"Adaptable Data Download Schedules for Agile Earth-Observing Satellites
In this paper, it is shown how decision making on data download schedules can be shared between ground and onboard to face uncertainty about the volumes of data generated by observations: download schedules are produced on the ground together with commitments to high-priority data downloads; these schedules are then adapted onboard when exact volumes are known, while guaranteeing that ground commitments be satisfied. This setting arises in a space application in which Earth-observing satellites perform observations, which produce data to be recorded onboard and then downloaded to ground reception stations, but the volume of data generated by observations is uncertain, due to the execution of sophisticated compression algorithms between observation and data recording.",0,0,0

"Organizational Structure, Environment and Performance: The Role of Strategic Choice
This paper critically examines available theoretical models which have been derived from statistically established patterns of association between contextual and organizational variables. These models offer an interpretation of organizational structure as a product of primarily economic constraints which contextual variables are assumed to impose. It is argued that available models in fact attempt to explain organization at one remove by ignoring the essentially political process, whereby power-holders within organizations decide upon courses of strategic action. This `strategic choice' typically includes not only the establishment of structural forms but also the manipulation of environmental features and the choice of relevant performance standards. A theoretical re-orientation of this kind away from functional imperatives and towards a recognition of political action is developed and illustrated in the main body of the paper.",0,1,0
"Learning to simulate and design for structural engineering
The structural design process for buildings is time-consuming and laborious. To automate this process, structural engineers combine optimization methods with simulation tools to find an optimal design with minimal building mass subject to building regulations. However, structural engineers in practice often avoid optimization and compromise on a suboptimal design for the majority of buildings, due to the large size of the design space, the iterative nature of the optimization methods, and the slow simulation tools. In this work, we formulate the building structures as graphs and create an end-to-end pipeline that can learn to propose the optimal cross-sections of columns and beams by training together with a pre-trained differentiable structural simulator. The performance of the proposed structural designs is comparable to the ones optimized by genetic algorithm (GA), with all the constraints satisfied. The optimal structural design with the reduced the building mass can not only lower the material cost, but also decrease the carbon footprint.",0,1,1

"Applied Exoskeleton Technology: A Comprehensive Review of Physical and Cognitive Human-Robot-Interfac
Exoskeletons and orthoses are wearable mobile systems pro- viding mechanical beneﬁts to the users. Despite signiﬁcant im-provements in the last decades, the technology is not fully mature to be adopted for strenuous and non-programmed tasks. To accommodate this insufﬁciency, different aspects of this technology need to be analysed and improved. Numerous studies have been trying to address some aspects of exoskeletons, e.g. mechanism design, intent prediction, and control scheme. However, most works have focused on a speciﬁc element of design or application without providing a comprehensive review framework. This study aims to analyse and survey the contributing aspects to the improvement and broad adoption of this technology. To address this, after introducing assistive devices and exoskeletons, the main design criteria will be investigated from a physical Human-Robot Interface (HRI) perspective. The study will be further developed by outlining several examples of known assistive devices in different categories. In order to establish an intelligent HRI strategy and enabling intuitive control for users, cognitive HRI will be investigated. Various approaches to this strategy will be reviewed, and a model for intent prediction will be proposed. This model is utilised to predict the gate phase from a single Electromyography (EMG) channel input. The outcomes of modelling show the potential use of single-channel input in low- power assistive devices. Furthermore, the proposed model can provide redundancy in devices with a complex control strategy.",0,1,1
"A novel Gaussian process regression model for state-of-health estimation of lithium-ion battery using charging curve
Abstract The state-of-health (SOH) estimation is always a crucial issue for lithium-ion batteries. In order to provide an accurate and reliable SOH estimation, a novel Gaussian process regression (GPR) model based on charging curve is proposed in this paper. Different from other researches where SOH is commonly estimated by cycle life, in this work four specific parameters extracted from charging curves are used as inputs of the GPR model instead of cycle numbers. These parameters can reflect the battery aging phenomenon from different angles. The grey relational analysis method is applied to analyze the relational grade between selected features and SOH. On the other hand, some adjustments are made in the proposed GPR model. Covariance function design and the similarity measurement of input variables are modified so as to improve the SOH estimate accuracy and adapt to the case of multidimensional input. Several aging data from NASA data repository are used for demonstrating the estimation effect by the proposed method. Results show that the proposed method has high SOH estimation accuracy. Besides, a battery with dynamic discharging profile is used to verify the robustness and reliability of this method.",0,0,1

"A Simple Method to Determine Critical Coagulation Concentration from Electrophoretic Mobility
Critical coagulation concentration (CCC) is a key parameter of particle dispersions, since it provides the threshold limit of electrolyte concentrations, above which the dispersions are destabilized due to rapid particle aggregation. A computational method is proposed to predict CCC values using solely electrophoretic mobility data without the need to measure aggregation rates of the particles. The model relies on the DLVO theory; contributions from repulsive double-layer forces and attractive van der Waals forces are included. Comparison between the calculated and previously reported experimental CCC data for the same particles shows that the method performs well in the presence of mono and multivalent electrolytes provided DLVO interparticle forces are dominant. The method is validated for particles of various compositions, shapes, and sizes.",0,0,1

However, productivity is still an issue in current software development and not all factors and their relationships are known. This paper reviews the large body of available literature in order to distill a list of the main factors influencing productivity investigated so far. The measure for importance here is the number of articles a factor is mentioned in.

The resulting list can be used to guide further analysis and as basis for building productivity models.",0,0,0
"V-belt transmissions of agricultural machines
The article is devoted to the analysis of design features and operating conditions of V-belt trans-missions of agricultural machinery. When designing these gears, it is recommended to give prefer-ence to gears made according to an open circuit or with a tension roller located outside the belt con-tour, to avoid cross and semi-cross gears, as well as multi-pulley gears with crossing shaft axles. To make the wider use of more progressive types of belts. It was shown that the features of V-belt transmissions of agricultural machinery require clarification of the methods for calculating trans-missions with progressive types of V-belts and automatic belt tensioning methods. It was noted that special attention should be paid to transmissions with multi-profile belts, which calculation has not been sufficiently reflected in domestic regulatory documents. The advantages of such belts are es-pecially noticeable under variable and shock loading. Based on the analysis, the recommendations for clarifying the calculation of belt drives with multi-profile belts were given. Analytical dependencies are proposed for determining the value of the nominal power transmitted by one belt (stream) of a multi-profile belt, allowing automation of the calculation of V-belt transmissions of agricultural machinery. For gears with a tension or guide roller that add an extra (sometimes reverse) bend of the belt, it is proposed to determine the coeffi-cient taking into account different degrees of bending on the pulleys according to a graph built tak-ing into account the linear hypothesis of summation of damages. It is recommended to calculate gears with spring-loaded tensioning rollers and design tensioning devices for such transmissions using a special method that takes into account the belt tensioning method. At the same time, the required value of the pre-tension of the belt can be significantly re-duced, which will have a positive effect on its resource, without losing the traction capacity of the transmission itself. Expressions are given for finding the value of the pre-tension of belts, both for gears with tension due to the elasticity of the belt, and for gears with spring-loaded tension rollers. Conclusions and directions for further research are formulated.",0,0,1
"Topology optimization of dielectric elastomers for wide tunable band gaps
Abstract Dielectric elastomer composites exhibit band gaps—ranges of frequencies at which elastic waves cannot propagate—that are tunable by electrostatically-controlled deformations. We show how topology optimization of such composites can widen these gaps and improve their tunability. Our case study focuses on anti-plane shear waves in fiber composites, across a designated frequency range. Employing a genetic algorithm approach, we maximize the gap width when the composite is actuated by prescribed electric fields, as well the relative change in the gap width with respect to an unactuated composite. We present optimization results for a composite whose constituents agree with commercial products. We compare these results with the performance of a composite of the same constituents arranged in circular fibers, to demonstrate the improvement achieved by the optimization. We expect that the performance of dielectric elastomer composites can be further improved, by employing a larger design space than the exemplary space in this study.",0,0,1
"Human Electromagnetic Field Exposure in Wearable Communications: A Review
The concern on human health is often overseen while wearable technologies attract exploding interests. Mainly due to the extreme proximity or a direct physical contact to the human skin, wearable communications devices are acknowledged to cause higher levels of specific absorption rate (SAR) at the skin surface. Unfortunately, so far, we have found no study encompassing all the aspects that the general public needs to understand about wearable technologies--i.e., the analytical and experimental backgrounds, and report of SAR levels generated from commercial wearable devices. In this context, this paper provides an extensive review on SAR from various commercial wearable devices that are currently sold in the market, as well as the analytical framework and the current measurement methodologies for standard compliance tests. Moreover, considering the present interest in millimeter wave (mmW), this paper sheds light on the SAR evaluated at 60 GHz and also compares the SAR to that measured at 2.4 GHz. We expect that this paper will be of value in informing the general public of the safety in using the currently sold wearable devices, and in igniting further study of the exact biological consequences from electromagnetic field (EMF) exposure due to wearable devices.",0,1,0
"Fed-BEV: A Federated Learning Framework for Modelling Energy Consumption of Battery Electric Vehicles
Recently, there has been an increasing interest in the roll-out of electric vehicles (EVs) in the global automotive market. Compared to conventional internal combustion engine vehicles (ICEVs), EVs can not only help users reduce monetary costs in their daily commuting, but also can effectively help mitigate the increasing level of traffic emissions produced in cities. Among many others, battery electric vehicles (BEVs) exclusively use chemical energy stored in their battery packs for propulsion. Hence, it becomes important to understand how much energy can be consumed by such vehicles in various traffic scenarios towards effective energy management. To address this challenge, we propose a novel framework in this paper by leveraging the federated learning approaches for modelling energy consumption for BEVs (Fed-BEV). More specifically, a group of BEVs involved in the Fed-BEV framework can learn from each other to jointly enhance their energy consumption model. We present the design of the proposed system architecture and implementation details in a co-simulation environment. Finally, comparative studies and simulation results are discussed to illustrate the efficacy of our proposed framework for accurate energy modelling of BEVs.",1,1,1

"The Effects of Optimism, Transformational Leadership, and Work Engagement on Work Outcomes: A Moderated Mediation Model
THE EFFECTS OF OPTIMISM, TRANSFORMATIONAL LEADERSHIP, AND WORK ENGAGEMENT ON WORK OUTCOMES: A MODERATED MEDIATION MODEL Chad Kenneally Old Dominion University, 2020 Director: Dr. Xiaoxiao Hu Optimism serves as a powerful resource that can help employees accomplish tasks at work and overcome challenges. However, there are still psychological connections that need to be drawn to explain why optimism has these effects. The Job Demands-Resources Model and the general resource perspective have previously investigated resources in the workplace and the relationships they hold with different work outcomes. In this study, work engagement was investigated as a mediator between optimism and task performance, work withdrawal, and turnover intention. Transformational leadership was investigated as a moderator for the relationship between optimism and work engagement. Optimism was expected to have a positive relationship with all three work outcomes through work engagement. Furthermore, transformational leadership was expected to influence the relationship between optimism and outcomes. These hypotheses were tested using data from Chinese business organizations. Results showed that optimism was significantly correlated with all three work outcomes. However, work engagement was not found to be a significant mediator, and transformational leadership did not significantly moderate the relationship between optimism and work engagement. Although most hypotheses were not supported, these results still represent important findings for optimism.

"Design and Characterization of 3D Printed, Open-Source Actuators for Legged Locomotion
Impressive animal locomotion capabilities are mediated by the co-evolution of the skeletal morphology and muscular properties. Legged robot performance would also likely benefit from the co-optimization of actuators and leg morphology. However, development of custom actuators for legged robots is often expensive and time consuming, which discourages roboticists from pursuing performance gains afforded by application-specific actuator optimization. This paper presents open-source designs for two quasi-direct-drive actuators with performance regimes appropriate for an 8–15 kg robot, built completely with off the shelf and 3D-printed components for less than $200 USD each. The mechanical, electrical, and thermal properties of each actuator are characterized and compared to benchmark data. Actuators subjected to 420k strides of gait data experienced only a 2% reduction in efficiency and 26 mrad in backlash growth, demonstrating viability for rigorous and sustained research applications. We present a thermal solution that nearly doubles the thermally-driven torque limits of our plastic actuator design. The performance results are comparable to traditional metallic actuators for use in high-speed legged robots of the same scale. These 3D printed designs demonstrate an approach for designing and characterizing low-cost, highly customizable, and highly reproducible actuators, democratizing the field of actuator design and enabling co-design and optimization of actuators and robot legs.",0,1,1

"PRESCRIBED-PERFORMANCE-BASED ADAPTIVE CONTROL FOR HYBRID ENERGY STORAGE SYSTEMS OF BATTERY AND SUPERCAPACITOR IN ELECTRIC VEHICLES
To achieve the desired prescribed dynamic and steady-state responses, a prescribed performance control strategy is proposed in electric vehicle system, whose power system is hybrid energy storage system (HESS). The strategy also adopts adaptive control to estimate unknown parameters. Firstly, mathematical models of HESS are derived and the unknown parameters are defined. Secondly, according to the working characteristics of energy storage units (ESUs), battery and supercapacitor are responsible for supplying power to load in different situations. Then, the performance function is considered as a prescribed range for the current tracking error and the corresponding error transformation is introduced. Meanwhile, under the projection operator adaptive law, unknown parameters can be estimated and control laws can be obtained. In addition, the whole system including models and controller is proved to be stable. Finally, simulation results show the effectiveness and superiority of the proposed control strategy.",0,1,1
"LSTM-based model predictive control with discrete inputs for irrigation scheduling
The development of well-devised irrigation scheduling methods is desirable from the perspectives of plant quality and water conservation. In this article, a model predictive control (MPC) with discrete actuators is developed for irrigation scheduling, where a long short-term memory (LSTM) model of the soil-water-atmosphere system is used to evaluate the objective of ensuring optimal water uptake in crops while minimizing total water consumption and irrigation costs. A heuristic method involving a sigmoid function is used in this framework to enhance the computational efficiency of the scheduler. The scheduling scheme is applied to homogeneous and spatially variable fields and the results indicate that the LSTM-based MPC with discrete actuators is able to prescribe optimal or near-optimal irrigation schedules that are typical of irrigation practice.",0,0,1
"Low-Frequency Pulse Voltage Injection Scheme-Based Sensorless Control of IPMSM Drives for Audible Noise Reduction
High-frequency (HF) signal injection has been widely used in the sensorless control of interior permanent magnet synchronous motor (IPMSM) drives for zero- and low-speed operation. However, the audible noise pollution caused by induced HF current has restricted its application. To solve this problem, a low-frequency (LF) pulse voltage injection scheme is proposed in this paper. Different from the traditional LF injection methods, by separating the injection and the control periods, it is easy to extract the fundamental and the induced currents without digital filters, which makes the position estimation more realizable. Since the accuracy of position estimation decreases, an enhanced vector-tracking observer based on the harmonic analysis of the discrete position signal is proposed. Then, the stability of the proposed observer is analyzed. The negative effects of estimation errors on position estimation are investigated, and notch filters are adopted to achieve further harmonic reduction. Finally, this sensorless control method is verified by experiments on a 2.2-kW IPMSM drive platform.",0,1,1
"Implications of inherent inhomogeneities in thin carbon fiber-based gas diffusion layers: A comparative modeling study
Abstract Thin porous media are present in multiple electrochemical energy devices, where they provide key transport and structural functions. The prototypical example is gas diffusion layers (GDLs) in polymer-electrolyte fuel cells (PEFCs). While modeling has traditionally been used to explore PEFC operation, this is often accomplished using volume-averaged (VA) formulations, where the intrinsic inhomogeneities of the GDL are smoothed out and the lack of defining a representative elementary volume is an ever-present issue. In this work, the predictions of a single-phase VA PEFC model are compared to those of a pore-scale PEFC model using GDL tomograms as a part of the meshed domain to delineate important aspects that VA models cannot address. The results demonstrate that while VA models equipped with suitable effective properties can provide a good average estimate for overall performance, the lack of accounting for real structures limits their predictive power, especially for durability and degradation behavior where large deviations are found in the spatial distributions. Furthermore, interfacial effects between the GDL and the microporous layer are explored with the pore-scale model to understand the implications of the layered geometry. It is shown that the actual microstructure of the GDL/MPL transition region can significantly affect the fluxes across the sandwich, something that VA models cannot easily consider. Interfacial design is recognized as a key quality control parameter for large-scale MEA manufacturing and assembly.",0,0,1
"Developing a Trustworthy AI culture in Scientific Research
The development of a Trustworthy AI culture among researchers and students in the AI field is a major challenges for universities. Researchers are the main actors in stimulating AI technological progress, but they often lack of support, guidance and education regarding all the appropriate measures that should be taken in order to develop trustworthy AI systems. More often than not, ethical, privacy, and legal compliance is regarded as a mere bureaucratic burden that makes their work more difficult, as shown in the literature (Peloquin et al., 2020). Scientific research benefits from some partial legal exemptions, but researchers involved in the development of AI systems still must comply with many applicable laws and regulations, such as GDPR, ePrivacy Directive, civil liability rules, contractual law, intellectual property law, and, soon, also new regulations such as the so called “AI Act”. However, exemptions do not apply when the research output is commercially exploited, and that represents a challenge for technical universities strictly connected to industry. In fact, it is very common that researchers perform analysis on behalf of (or together with) other entities, such as companies, hospitals, NGOs, and Public Administration bodies. This means that for researchers it is often very difficult to understand where the line of the exemption applicability is drawn and how to perform the appropriate compliance when developing new AI tools. It is important to note that the major legal issues are not triggered by a specific AI technique but instead by its concrete consequences on humans. Impact of AI systems on individual rights must be thoughtfully analyzed and explored from a legal and ethical point of view, because such systems can lead to negative consequences on citizens (for example, the lack of a sufficient explanation of their effects) especially when they require the use of personal data.

"Pooled Confirmatory Factor Analysis (PCFA) Using Structural Equation Modeling on Volunteerism Program: A Step by Step Approach

"Persuasion Through Selective Disclosure: Implications for Marketing, Campaigning, and Privacy Regulation
This paper models how firms or political campaigners (senders) persuade consumers and voters (receivers) by selectively disclosing information about their offering depending on individual receivers' preferences and orientations. We derive positive and normative implications depending on the extent of competition among senders, whether receivers are wary of senders collecting personalized data, and whether firms are able to personalize prices. We show how both senders and receivers can benefit from selective disclosure. Privacy laws requiring senders to obtain consent to acquire personal information that enables such selective disclosure increases receiver welfare if and only if there is little or asymmetric competition among senders, if receivers are unwary, and if firms can price discriminate. This paper has been accepted by Joshua Gans, business strategy.",0,1,0
"A cost-effective maximum likelihood receiver for multicarrier systems
Equalization structures for maximum likelihood (ML) reception of data transmitted over intersymbol interference channels are studied. The equalizer that is best for the ML receiver is derived from a general theory of decision-aided equalization. The resulting optimum equalizers are linear and do not use previous decisions. If the equalizer complexity is permitted to be infinite, then a general optimum class of structures is derived that includes the decision feedback equalizer and the lesser-known autoregressive moving average filters. When a complexity constraint is also imposed on the equalizer, one of the structures in this class will be best for a given ML receiver. The best structure is found by a simple search procedure, which is given. The results indicate that near-optimum performance can be achieved by using this approach at a great computational reduction.<<ETX>>",0,0,0
"Fault feature extraction of rolling element bearings using sparse representation
Abstract Influenced by factors such as speed fluctuation, rolling element sliding and periodical variation of load distribution and impact force on the measuring direction of sensor, the impulse response signals caused by defective rolling bearing are non-stationary, and the amplitudes of the impulse may even drop to zero when the fault is out of load zone. The non-stationary characteristic and impulse missing phenomenon reduce the effectiveness of the commonly used demodulation method on rolling element bearing fault diagnosis. Based on sparse representation theories, a new approach for fault diagnosis of rolling element bearing is proposed. The over-complete dictionary is constructed by the unit impulse response function of damped second-order system, whose natural frequencies and relative damping ratios are directly identified from the fault signal by correlation filtering method. It leads to a high similarity between atoms and defect induced impulse, and also a sharply reduction of the redundancy of the dictionary. To improve the matching accuracy and calculation speed of sparse coefficient solving, the fault signal is divided into segments and the matching pursuit algorithm is carried out by segments. After splicing together all the reconstructed signals, the fault feature is extracted successfully. The simulation and experimental results show that the proposed method is effective for the fault diagnosis of rolling element bearing in large rolling element sliding and low signal to noise ratio circumstances.",0,0,1
"Method of the concrete equivalent mortar (CEM)A new tool to design concrete containing admixture
This paper deals with a new method to design concrete containing admixture. Its principle is to design a mortar, deduced from the concrete composition and called concrete equivalent mortar (CEM), for which the rheological properties display correlation with those of concrete. The aim is to reduce the amount of concrete batches. This article presents the scientific approach which has led to this method, its field application and limits. The test procedure and the apparatus are detailed. An example of correlation between the rheological properties measured on CEM and on the corresponding concrete is presented. After monitoring fluidity versus time relationship, thermal measurements on CEM were carried out. These measurements allow to anticipate the effects of different admixtures on the setting time. One shows that the setting delays obtained on CEM are in good agreement with the difference of compressive strengths measured at early age. With rheological and thermal results, the CEM method permits to select between numerous admixtures, which is the most likely to fit in with the specifications of effectiveness (proportion/cost ratio), capacity of keeping the rheological properties over time and delay of formwork removal. R É S U M É L’article présente une nouvelle méthode d’aide à la formulation des bétons adjuvantés. Elle consiste à concevoir, à partir d’une composition de béton, un mortier, dit mortier de béton équivalent (MBE), dont les propriétés rhéologiques sont corrélables à celles du béton. Le but est de diminuer le nombre de gâchées de béton. La démarche de mise au point de la méthode, son champ d’application et ses limites sont présentés. Le mode opératoire ainsi que le matériel nécessaire sont détaillés. Un exemple de corrélation entre les propriétés rhéologiques mesurées sur MBE et celles mesurées sur le béton associé est présenté. Parallèlement aux suivis rhéologiques, des suivis thermiques sur MBE peuvent être effectués. Ils permettent d’anticiper les effets de différents adjuvants sur le temps de prise du béton. On montre que les décalages observés par suivi thermique traduisent bien les écarts de résistances aux très courtes échéances. En associant suivis rhéologiques et suivis thermiques, la méthode MBE permet de sélectionner rapidement parmi différents adjuvants celui qui répond le mieux aux exigences d’efficacité (rapport dosage/coût), de maintien rhéologique et de délai de décoffrage.

"The Effects of COVID-19 Risk Perception on Travel Intention: Evidence From Chinese Travelers
This study attempts to assess the relationship between risk perception, risk knowledge, and travel intentions of Chinese leisure travelers during the COVID-19 pandemic in the framework of social contagion and risk communication theories by analyzing a sample of 1,209 travelers through structural equation modeling (SEM) and path analysis. We used the process macro of Hayes to analyze the moderation effects of age, gender, and education between risk perception, media and interpersonal communication, and risk knowledge. It was found that travelers were more concerned about self-efficacy than severity. Risk perception of travelers predicts the information-seeking process of tourists. This process helps travelers to accumulate risk information that influences their travel intentions. Travelers give more importance to interpersonal (contagion) communication in making a traveling decision. Demographic factors influence traveling decision-making; women travelers were found to be more risk resilient than men. Young travelers seek information at low- and old travelers at high-risk levels. Marketing implications also provided.",0,0,0
"A Spherical Magnetic Dipole Actuator for Spacecraft Attitude Control
This paper presents a procedure to estimate the back-EMF voltages and the rotor angular velocity of a reaction sphere actuator for satellite attitude control. The reaction sphere is a permanent magnet synchronous spherical actuator whose rotor is magnetically levitated and can be accelerated about any desired axis. The spherical actuator is composed of an 8-pole permanent magnet spherical rotor and of a 20coil stator. The developed technique to measure the back-EMF voltages is based on Faraday’s law, in which the magnetic flux density is decomposed on a spherical harmonic basis, whose expansion parameters are derived from measurements of the radial component of the field collected from at least seven locations. Then, given the back-EMF voltages, the rotor angular velocity is derived employing the energy conservation principle. The resulting expressions are linear and are expressed in closedform. Finally, the proposed method is validated numerically with finite element simulations and experimentally using a developed laboratory prototype.",0,1,1
"Documentation of bridges by terrestrial laser scanner
Bridge structures are subjected to deterioration due to excessive usage, overloading, and aging material. For the last two decades, a significant amount research has been developed for collecting data for structural health monitoring. Yet, visual investigation with an on-site inspector remains the predominant method. This is true despite the highly subjective and time consuming aspects of this approach. Alternatively, terrestrial laser scanning can acquire surface details of structures quickly and accurately and is, thus, an emerging means to overcome the shortcomings of direct visual inspection. This paper presents a procedure for data collection for bridge inspection documentation and proposes a “cell-based method” for determination of structure deterioration (involving vertical deformation and lateral distortion), as well as surface loss due to corrosion. The Guinness Bridge built in 1880s located in Dublin council, Ireland is selected as a case study to illustrate the efficacy of the proposed method.",0,0,1

"Design and Performance of Concrete Pile Strengthened with Lengthened Steel-Tube Core: Model Tests and Numerical Simulations
In order to solve the problem of insufficient bearing capacity of existing concrete piles, a type of concrete pile with an additional lengthened strengthening core is designed, by inserting the steel tube through guiding hole and pouring core concrete. To reveal the mechanical performance of the reinforced piles, scale model tests and finite element simulations were performed. The results showed that both the vertical and horizontal bearing capacity increase with the length of the stiffening core. The axial force of the enhanced core is also smaller than conventional concrete piles, and the extended core can share the axial force of the foundation pile to improve the stress distribution of the pile body. These findings point toward a useful and general method for increasing the load capacity of existing concrete piles.",0,1,1
"The Elements of Statistical Learning
Chapter 11 includes more case studies in other areas, ranging from manufacturing to marketing research. Chapter 12 concludes the book with some commentary about the scienti c contributions of MTS. The Taguchi method for design of experiment has generated considerable controversy in the statistical community over the past few decades. The MTS/MTGS method seems to lead another source of discussions on the methodology it advocates (Montgomery 2003). As pointed out by Woodall et al. (2003), the MTS/MTGS methods are considered ad hoc in the sense that they have not been developed using any underlying statistical theory. Because the “normal” and “abnormal” groups form the basis of the theory, some sampling restrictions are fundamental to the applications. First, it is essential that the “normal” sample be uniform, unbiased, and/or complete so that a reliable measurement scale is obtained. Second, the selection of “abnormal” samples is crucial to the success of dimensionality reduction when OAs are used. For example, if each abnormal item is really unique in the medical example, then it is unclear how the statistical distance MD can be guaranteed to give a consistent diagnosis measure of severity on a continuous scale when the larger-the-better type S/N ratio is used. Multivariate diagnosis is not new to Technometrics readers and is now becoming increasingly more popular in statistical analysis and data mining for knowledge discovery. As a promising alternative that assumes no underlying data model, The Mahalanobis–Taguchi Strategy does not provide suf cient evidence of gains achieved by using the proposed method over existing tools. Readers may be very interested in a detailed comparison with other diagnostic tools, such as logistic regression and tree-based methods. Overall, although the idea of MTS/MTGS is intriguing, this book would be more valuable had it been written in a rigorous fashion as a technical reference. There is some lack of precision even in several mathematical notations. Perhaps a follow-up with additional theoretical justi cation and careful case studies would answer some of the lingering questions.",0,1,0
"IEEE 802.15.3d: First Standardization Efforts for Sub-Terahertz Band Communications towards 6G
With the ratification of the IEEE 802.15.3d amendment to the 802.15.3, a first step has been made to standardize consumer wireless communications in the sub-THz frequency band. The IEEE 802.15.3d offers switched point-to-point connectivity with the data rates of 100\,Gbit/s and higher at distances ranging from tens of centimeters up to a few hundred meters. In this article, we provide a detailed introduction to the IEEE 802.15.3d and the key design principles beyond the developed standard. We particularly describe the target applications and usage scenarios, as well as the specifics of the IEEE 802.15.3d physical and medium access layers. Later, we present the results of the initial performance evaluation of IEEE 802.15.3d wireless communications. The obtained first-order performance predictions show non-incremental benefits compared to the characteristics of the fifth-generation wireless systems, thus paving the way towards the six-generation (6G) THz networks. We conclude the article by outlining the further standardization and regulatory activities on wireless networking in the THz frequency band.",0,1,0

Next, these field expressions are weakly enforced through the Interior Penalty (IP) DG formulation. The proposed method is explicit and conditionally stable. Additionally, a local time-stepping strategy is applied to increase efficiency and reduce the computational time. Finally, a numerical example is presented to validate the proposed approach.",0,1,1

"Explanations in Autonomous Driving: A Survey
The automotive industry has witnessed an increasing level of development in the past decades; from manufacturing manually operated vehicles to manufacturing vehicles with a high level of automation. With the recent developments in Artificial Intelligence (AI), automotive companies now employ blackbox AI models to enable vehicles to perceive their environment and make driving decisions with little or no input from a human. With the hope to deploy autonomous vehicles (AV) on a commercial scale, the acceptance of AV by society becomes paramount and may largely depend on their degree of transparency, trustworthiness, and compliance with regulations. The assessment of the compliance of AVs to these acceptance requirements can be facilitated through the provision of explanations for AVs’ behaviour. Explainability is therefore seen as an important requirement for AVs. AVs should be able to explain what they have ‘seen’, done, and might do in environments in which they operate. In this paper, we provide a comprehensive survey of the existing work in explainable autonomous driving. First, we open by providing a motivation for explanations by highlighting the importance of transparency, accountability, and trust in AVs; and examining existing regulations and standards related to AVs. Second, we identify and categorise the different stakeholders involved in the development, use, and regulation of AVs and elicit their AV explanation requirements. Third, we provide a rigorous review of previous work on explanations for the different AV operations (i.e., perception, localisation, planning, vehicle control, and system management). Finally, we discuss pertinent challenges and provide recommendations including a conceptual framework for AV explainability. This survey aims to provide the fundamental knowledge required of researchers who are interested in explanation provisions in autonomous driving.",0,0,0
"Feature-rich bifurcations in a simple electronic circuit
A simple electronic circuit with a voltage controlled current source is investigated. The circuit exhibits rich dynamics upon varying the circuit elements such as L,C and R, and the control factor of the current source. Among several other interesting features, the circuit demonstrates two local bifurcations, namely, node to spiral and Hopf bifurcation, and a global homoclinic bifurcation. Phase-portraits corresponding to these bifurcations are presented and the implications of these bifurcations on system stability are discussed. In particular, the circuit parameters corresponding to the onset of Hopf bifurcation may be exploited to design an oscillator with stable frequency and amplitude. The circuit may be easily implemented with nonlinear resistive elements such as diodes or transistors in saturation and a gyrator block as the voltage controlled current source.",0,1,1
